Abney, examines and compares various maps of the solar spectrum, specifically the infra-red region, and determines the wave-lengths of several prominent lines using mirrors and gratings. He discusses the discrepancies between different maps and methods, and provides accurate measurements for the wave-lengths of these lines.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
