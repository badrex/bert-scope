The author discovers a constant quantity unique to each element that plays a significant role in the constitution of the sequences. The study also explores displacement patterns, including doublet and triplet series, and the existence of satellites. Furthermore, the article discusses the importance of understanding the laws governing these displacements in spark and vacuum tube spectra.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
