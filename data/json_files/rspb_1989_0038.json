They studied the effects of external selenate, tungstate, molybdate, and chromate on sulphate efflux from brush-border membrane vesicles. The method allows for the analysis of transport systems that do not exhibit significant asymmetry, enhancing its applicability. The results provide insights into the transport mechanism involved and help distinguish between transported ligands and competitive inhibitors.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology and Physiology"}
