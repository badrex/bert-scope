They find that the initiation reaction is first order, and the main termination step is the combination of methyl radicals, which is second order. The results provide a better understanding of the reaction kinetics and the formation of minor products like acetone, propionaldehyde, and ethylene.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
