They used a working rule that only molecular refractivities suitable for mathematical analysis can be expressed by dispersion formulae containing only a single characteristic frequency. The atomic refractivity of hydrogen was derived as half the difference between the molecular refractions of hexane (C6H14) and hexane (C6H12). The atomic refractivity of carbon was obtained as the simple difference R[C] - R[CH2] - R[H2]. The results showed that the value for the refractivity of the methylene radical was identical to the mean value deduced by Eisenlohr from his measurements of many series of open-chain compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
