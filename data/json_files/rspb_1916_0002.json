They find that body length can be correctly expressed as a function of body weight, conforming to the formula l = m^k, where l is the length of the body (stem-length), m is the weight (without clothes) in grams, k is a constant, and n has an approximate value of 0.33. This formula holds satisfactorily for boys up to 15 years old and weights of 51,000 grams (8 stone 1 lb.).", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Human Biology"}
