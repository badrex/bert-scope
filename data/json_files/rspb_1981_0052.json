The authors examine the shape and cytoarchitecture of both p.g.cs and coelomic epithelial cells (c.e.cs) and find that c.e.cs provide a firm, orientated support and possible guide for p.g.c movement. The results suggest that p.g.cs move by forming direct adhesion plaques with c.e.cs.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
