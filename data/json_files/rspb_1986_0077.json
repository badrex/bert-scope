They used optical techniques to record the depolarization of the transverse tubular membrane and calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, suggesting that a sequence of chemical steps may link the electrical signal in the tubules to the opening of calcium channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
