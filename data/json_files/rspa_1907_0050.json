They discovered that the burning relation is expressed by an equation of the form S = aP + C, where a varies with the initial temperature of the cordite. The authors also found that there is a two-phase condition in the burning of tubes, with excess internal pressure existing in the first phase. This theory helps explain ballistic and other phenomena related to the burning of tubes and has practical applications in gun technology.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
