The author applies harmonic analysis to obtain a more general solution, focusing on the integration of Laplace's equations and the deduction of linear equations connecting coefficients in the expansion of tide-height. The article also discusses the existence of a second class of free oscillations and provides numerical examples for the evaluation of semi-diurnal and diurnal tidal constituents.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
