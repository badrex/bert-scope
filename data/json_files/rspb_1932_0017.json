They found that decerebration at the level of the pons led to increased blood sugar levels, while decerebration at other levels did not. The authors also investigated the role of glycogen in liver and muscles and its relationship to blood sugar levels. Their findings suggest that glycogen in the liver exists in two physiological states, one as a storage form and the other as a gluconeogenic form synthesized from proteins and lactic acid.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
