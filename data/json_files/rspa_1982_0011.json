The research shows that grain boundary diffusivities of both iron and tin in iron can be reduced by over an order of magnitude due to tin segregation. The findings are explained using the theory of Borisov et al. (1964), which involves grain boundary energies. This understanding allows for predictions about systems where grain boundary diffusivities are reduced or enhanced by solute additions.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Grain Boundary Diffusion", "article_id": "rspa_1982_0011"}
