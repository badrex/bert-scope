They found that the rhythm of muscular response maintains a constant rate of approximately ten per second, independent of the excitation rate. This research provides insights into the normal rate of discharge of nervous impulses and the rhythm of voluntary contractions in both animals and humans.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
