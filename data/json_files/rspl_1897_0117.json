It has unique properties, such as losing density and emitting heat when heated. The mineral mainly consists of niobium and yttrium oxides, along with small amounts of uranium. The presence of helium in the mineral suggests that it may be an endothermic compound, and its behavior raises questions about its origin and potential connection to the interior of the Earth."}
