This leads to the formation of a re-entrant jet and a salient jet, which create high pressure at the stagnation point, causing the parent plate to deform and form waves. The new theory explains the observed behavior in experiments and provides a better understanding of the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
