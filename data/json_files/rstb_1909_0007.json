The venom was extracted from dried glands and tested on frogs, rabbits, rats, cats, and pigeons. The minimum-lethal doses were determined for each animal, and the symptoms and effects of the venom were observed and documented. The results show that Sepedon h\\#xE6;machates venom is highly toxic and has varying effects on different animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
