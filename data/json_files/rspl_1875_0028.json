They discuss the influence of the sun and moon on the Earth's magnetism, finding that the sun's rotation and the moon's position relative to the Earth affect the amplitude and timing of magnetic oscillations. The study also reveals a semiannual inequality in the dip, with a lower reading in the six months from April to September and a higher reading in the other six months.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
