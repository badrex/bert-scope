He provides tables and calculations to help determine the comet's path and when it will be visible. Barker explains how to use a scheme with a circle, parabola, and projections to find the geocentric longitude and latitude of the comet, which can help trace its course and potentially find the periods of other comets.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Celestial Mechanics"}
