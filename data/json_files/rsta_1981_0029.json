These methods help remove the broadening effect of dipole-dipole coupling and reveal chemical shifts, exchange interactions, and interaction tensor components. Techniques mentioned include rapid spinning, multiple pulse experiments, multiple-quantum spectra, and cross-polarization. The article reviews these methods, their limitations, and provides examples of their applications in various solid materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
