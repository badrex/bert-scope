Southwell made significant contributions to theoretical applied mechanics, including work on the strength of struts, the collapse of tubes under external pressure, and the general theory of elastic stability. He also played a crucial role in the development of non-rigid airships during World War I and later served as a Professor of Engineering Science at Oxford.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Aeronautics"}
