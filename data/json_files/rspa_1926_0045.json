They explore the role of ionization in the atmosphere's conductivity and the potential impact of ozone and other compounds on its electrical state. The authors also consider the influence of thunderstorms and the possibility of electrical forces affecting the atmosphere's composition.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atmospheric Physics"}
