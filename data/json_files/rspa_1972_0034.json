It constructs an exact form of an axially symmetric metric for a smooth toroidal pulse and discusses its properties, including self-reflexion and time-symmetry. The author also converts a Weber & Wheeler solution for a non-singular cylindrical pulse into a time-symmetric toroidal pulse and examines the distant gravitational field at the moment of symmetry."}
