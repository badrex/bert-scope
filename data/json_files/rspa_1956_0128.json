The authors develop a method for computing heating rates for a vibration-rotation band without using Kirchhoff's law, considering the effects of departures from a Boltzmann distribution. They apply this method to a model of the carbon dioxide band and analyze the heating rate per unit volume at different heights.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
