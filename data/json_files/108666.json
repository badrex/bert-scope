He measured the electromotive powers of thermo-elements formed from different pairs of metals and found that the values depend on the nature of each metal. The results are presented in a table, with silver taken as the reference value of 0, and the thermoelectric numbers of other metals calculated based on their relative values. The author also described the experimental setup and methods used for comparing thermo-elements and measuring temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electrochemistry"}
