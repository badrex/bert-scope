The spiders' specialized eyes help them locate and catch prey at night. The research shows that the cycle of membrane synthesis and destruction is controlled by immediate states of retinal illumination, superimposed on a daily rhythm. This process is crucial for the spiders' night vision and helps them adapt to their nocturnal lifestyle.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
