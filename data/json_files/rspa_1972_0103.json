They employed a mode-locked neodymium laser and calibrated the two-photon fluorescence measurements with single-photon fluorescence generated by second-harmonic laser pulses. The results showed good agreement with semi-empirical theoretical models and provided absolute values for the two-photon absorption cross-sections of the Xanthene dyes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Laser Physics"}
