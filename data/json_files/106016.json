He noticed the lightning affected horses and objects, such as the end of his stick with a brass ferule. The storm also produced beautiful streams of light resembling an Aurora Borealis. No thunder was heard during the storm, and a large ball of fire was seen passing under the zenith towards the southeast part of the horizon.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
