The author applies a theorem from 1949 to this representation, leading to Zeeman's theorem, which states that the most general point transformation of Minkowski space that preserves causality is the eleven-parameter group G generated by orthochronous Lorentz transformations, translations, and dilations.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Group Theory", "sub_discipline": "Lie Groups and Representations"}
