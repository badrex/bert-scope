They also explore the use of pituitary grafts to maintain mammary function in hypophysectomized rats. The study highlights the importance of prolactin, adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), and possibly growth hormone (GH) in lactation maintenance.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology and Endocrinology"}
