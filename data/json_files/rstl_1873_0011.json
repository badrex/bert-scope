They describe the plant's medullary axis, wood, and bark, as well as the plant's growth patterns and the presence of reticulated vessels. This research contributes to the understanding of plant life during the Carboniferous period.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleobotany"}
