They found that the main lines in the spectrum were similar to those in the spectra of hydrogen, magnesium, and other elements. The authors determined the wave-length of the nebula lines and compared them to the wave-lengths of known elements, suggesting that the fainter lines might be due to carbon or low-temperature metallic lines. This research contributed to the understanding of the composition and structure of the Orion Nebula.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrophysics"}
