They find that iron is present in the chromatin of a large number of cell species, and the intensity of the iron reaction is related to the amount of chromatin in the cells. This discovery could have implications for understanding the role of iron in cellular processes and the function of chromatin.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
