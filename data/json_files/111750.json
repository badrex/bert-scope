He found that changes in atmospheric pressure directly affected the mean level of the sea, with higher pressure leading to lower sea levels and lower pressure leading to higher sea levels. This discovery helped to better understand the movements of tides and the causes of their irregularities.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
