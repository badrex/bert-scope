The authors analyze the Moon's gravitational and magnetic fields, concluding that thermal convection is essential for understanding the Moon's thermal history, tectonic evidence in the lithospheric shell, and the history of the magnetic field. They also explore the possibility of an ancient lunar general magnetic field and its implications for the Moon's evolution and dynamics."}
