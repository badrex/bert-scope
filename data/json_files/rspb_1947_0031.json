They found that fibroin contains no amide-nitrogen and that the water-soluble form is the native or renatured protein, while the original fibroin is considered denatured. The study also discusses aspects of protein and polypeptide chains as macromolecules and their denaturation process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Protein Structure and Function"}
