The author investigates the algebraic analogues of logical relations and establishes that there is a fundamental difference between algebra and logic. Despite this difference, certain relations of equations allow the algebra of logic to be used as an algorithm for interpreting logical forms. The paper presents a solution to the difficulties arising from the interpretation of symbols in Boole's system.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Logic and Foundations of Mathematics"}
