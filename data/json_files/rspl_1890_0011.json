They discovered that the atrial chamber forms from the fusion of lateral outgrowths called metapleura, which are not connected to the coelom. This finding challenges previous theories about the formation of the atrial chamber and its relation to the epipleural walls in adult Amphioxus.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
