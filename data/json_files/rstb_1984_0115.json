The author explains how these parasites can evade the host's immune system by changing the surface antigens, allowing them to establish chronic infections and resist reinfection. The article also explores the implications of antigenic variation for malaria control and potential future research directions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
