The author presents a simple genetic model based on Haldane's arguments and explores its applicability to plant-fungus interactions. The model demonstrates that both host and pathogen will constantly alter their genotypes, favoring a diversity of types in both organisms. The author also considers the effects of density on the model and discusses the dynamic behavior of the interactions between plants and their fungal pathogens.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
