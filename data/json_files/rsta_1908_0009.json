They describe the experimental setup, the theory behind the method, and the importance of obtaining fresh surfaces for accurate measurements. The author also discusses the limitations and assumptions of the method and provides a table of calculated values for determining surface tension.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid mechanics"}
