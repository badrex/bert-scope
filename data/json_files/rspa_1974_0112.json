Instead, a sixth-order partial differential equation provides a more accurate description of the lattice dynamics. The author discusses the relative accuracies of three forms of the long-wavelength dispersion relation and compares them with exact lattice equations for various potential energy functions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nonlinear Dynamics"}
