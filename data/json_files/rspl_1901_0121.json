They found that the mean weight of one liter of oxygen vapor at 760 mm and 90.5 degrees absolute is 4.420 grams, with a specific volume of 226.25 cubic centimeters. The author also determined the density of nitrogen vapor at various pressures and temperatures, providing valuable data for further research in low-temperature physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
