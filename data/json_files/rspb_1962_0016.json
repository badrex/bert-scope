The authors found that an increase in caval pressure leads to a sustained rise in cerebrospinal fluid pressure, while a decrease in cardiac input results in a fall followed by a rise. These effects are mainly due to changes in central venous pressures and can be explained by the increase in regional intracraniovertebral venous sinus pressure. The study provides insights into the complex relationship between vascular variables and cerebrospinal fluid pressure in mammals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
