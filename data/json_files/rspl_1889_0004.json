Norman Lockyer, investigates the wave-length of the chief fluting seen in the spectrum of manganese. They compare the manganese fluting with the aurora line and find that the wave-length of the most refrangible edge of the fluting is about 5576. This research contributes to understanding the relationship between the spectra of meteorites, meteor swarms, stars, comets, and aurorae.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
