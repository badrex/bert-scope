The sediment analysis reveals that water quality began to deteriorate in the 20th century, leading to an acute acidification phase in the 1960s. The change in diatom flora and the decline in inferred pH from 6.1 in the 19th century to 4.6 in the present suggest that the acidification and biological changes in the lake are closely related to the increased deposition of atmospheric pollutants from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Limnology"}
