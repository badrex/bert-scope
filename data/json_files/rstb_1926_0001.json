They discover that the \"shell gland\" is an ectodermal gland and not a typical segmental excretory organ. The true antennal gland is found in the basal joint of the antenna, with a complicated intracellular efferent duct. This research provides insights into the excretory systems of crustaceans and contributes to the understanding of freshwater biology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
