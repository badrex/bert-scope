They discovered that absorbed oxygen inhibits the activity of the metal catalyst, while absorbed hydrogen does not significantly increase the activity. This finding challenges the previous explanation of the Bone and Wheeler effect and suggests that the mechanism of the influence of absorbed oxygen is due to the formation of an inactive film on the metal surface.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface chemistry"}
