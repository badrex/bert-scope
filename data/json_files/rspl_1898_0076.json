They tested for periodic vibrations in the crystals and found that the difference between the gravitational constants for parallel and crossed axes was not greater than 1/16,500 and 1/2,850 for quadrantal and semi-circular cases, respectively. The results showed that the semi-circular vibration was more outstanding, but the authors could not conclusively prove the existence of the couples due to the small effect size.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
