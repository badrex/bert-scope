They found that essential oils transmit continuous spectra and that some substances, like australene and terebenthene, have slightly different absorption patterns when diluted. The study provides valuable information for understanding the chemical composition and potential applications of essential oils.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
