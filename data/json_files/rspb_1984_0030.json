The author proposes a method to compute an instantaneous two-dimensional velocity field from the changing image, using the physical assumption of smoothness to determine a unique velocity field. The study suggests that this computation may be a plausible explanation for motion measurement in the human visual system.", "scientific_discipline": "Computer Science > Computer Vision"}
