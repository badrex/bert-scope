They derive various statistical properties, such as the probability distribution of surface elevation, average number of zero-crossings, and average length of contours. These findings are relevant to understanding waves in the open ocean and may also apply to other geophysical phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
