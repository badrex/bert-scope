The enzyme forms a compact spherical molecule with four subunits and has implications for understanding the evolution and function of aldolase enzymes. The study provides a foundation for further research into the enzyme's structure and potential applications in medicine and health sciences.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
