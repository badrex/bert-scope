They find that ammonia molecules occupy the space left by water molecules, causing the crystal to strain and shatter. The process involves the formation of new crystal corners, edges, and amorphous material, which affects the sorption and heat evolution. The study provides insights into the mechanism of sorption in zeolites and the role of crystal structure in the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Zeolites and Catalysis"}
