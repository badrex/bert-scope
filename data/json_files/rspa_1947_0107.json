They found that under certain conditions, more than 30% of the condensate can consist of hydrogen peroxide. The results indicate that hydrogen peroxide is formed by two mechanisms: recombination of hydroxyl radicals on cold walls and the formation of an excited radical that reacts with a hydrogen molecule to create hydrogen peroxide.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical reactions and kinetics"}
