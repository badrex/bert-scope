It highlights the need for breeding crops with better ability to grow in cool conditions and the potential benefits of selecting crops with higher yields of metabolizable energy and protein. The authors also emphasize the importance of considering environmental factors when determining crop distribution to maximize yields.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
