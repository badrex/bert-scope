They found that the rate of diffusion is proportional to the pressure of the gas and consists of two portions. The two exponential slopes are attributed to metallic allotropes. At lower pressures, the rate of diffusion becomes slower and is not related to any simple function of the pressure.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
