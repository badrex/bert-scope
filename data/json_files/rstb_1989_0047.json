It discusses the efficiency of forests as sinks for atmospheric pollutants and compares them with shorter vegetation. The study also highlights the influence of afforestation on pollutant deposition, using a specific case of Kielder Forest in northern Britain.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Forest Ecology"}
