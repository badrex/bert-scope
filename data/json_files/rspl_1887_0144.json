They discovered that the ordinary method of observing oceanic currents can mask any tidal effects. The author found that the tidal wave affects the deepest parts of the ocean and can create tidal currents even in areas without nearby land. They also observed that the integral drift in the twenty-four hours is due to the constant current alone, independently of the tidal current. The author suggests that more observations should be made on banks and ridges in the ocean to better understand tidal currents.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
