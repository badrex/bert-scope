He studies the changes in tracheal systems, spiracles, and air vesicles, as well as the respiratory muscles and nerves. Newport also conducts experiments to determine the quantity of oxygen consumed and carbon dioxide produced by various insects in different states. Lastly, he investigates the insects' ability to survive in different media, such as hydrogen, water, and gases.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
