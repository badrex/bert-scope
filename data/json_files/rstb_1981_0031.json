The implementation filters the left and right images with masks of different sizes, finds zero crossings, matches corresponding points, and stores the results in a dynamic buffer called the 2.5D sketch. The performance of the implementation is tested on various stereograms and compared to human perception, supporting the Marr-Poggio model and refining the theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Artificial Intelligence > Computer Vision"}
