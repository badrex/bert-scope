They found that ACh content varied among different animals but was relatively independent of muscle mass. In denervated muscles, the ACh content decreased after two days and reached a steady value of about 26% of the control by the eighth day. The ACh concentration in non-endplate segments was not affected by denervation. This study provides insights into the distribution and changes of ACh in frog muscles under different conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurochemistry"}
