They discuss the transformation of the general equation of conduction and the boundary conditions, and explore the properties of tesseral harmonics and associated functions in solving the problem. The analysis can be applied to other physical problems related to ellipsoids of revolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
