This formula is valid for various population models with specific characteristics, such as large population size, statistical equilibrium, and non-recurrent mutations. The paper demonstrates the unique status of the Ewens formula and discusses alternative sampling formulas for situations where these conditions are not met.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
