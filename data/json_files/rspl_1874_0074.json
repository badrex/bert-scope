The melting points of the alloys were calculated, and the results showed that the alloys' composition affects their melting points and solidification behavior. The author also investigated the effect of cooling rate on the structure of the alloys, finding that rapid cooling leads to more significant differences in composition between the center and the edges of the samples.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Metallurgy"}
