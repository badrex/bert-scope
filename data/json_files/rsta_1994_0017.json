They prove that the first initial-boundary value problem for these equations has a compact minimal global attractor, and establish some properties of the attractor. This work contributes to the understanding of fluid dynamics and the behavior of solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Functional Analysis"}
