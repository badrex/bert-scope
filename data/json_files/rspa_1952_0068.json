They studied the reaction kinetics, initiator effects, and the influence of reactant concentrations. The results showed that the reaction rate was proportional to the amount of residual 1-butene and that the polymerization process was similar to other normal radical polymerization reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
