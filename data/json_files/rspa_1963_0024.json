The authors describe the method of calculation, which involves the distorted wave method and the Coulomb-Born approximation. They provide tables and figures with the results of their calculations, discussing the contributions from different total angular momentum and comparing the distorted wave and Coulomb-Born methods. The study shows that the cross-section for ionization is influenced by the contribution of optical transitions and the ion charge.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
