By analyzing the data, they deduced a colonization sequence for the beetles, which matches the geological dating of the islands. This study provides insights into the evolutionary history of the beetles and the colonization patterns of the Canary Islands.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
