He used pendulums, measured distances, and observed echoes in various locations. The author found that sound moves faster in calm conditions and that the speed of sound is influenced by the environment, such as walls and other reflective surfaces. This research contributed to the understanding of sound propagation and reflection.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Acoustics"}
