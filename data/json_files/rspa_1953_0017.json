They develop an extension of the equations, improving upon previous theories and providing a better understanding of phase changes in fluids. The study also includes an analysis of X-ray scattering by fluids, offering insights into the behavior of fluids at the atomic level.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
