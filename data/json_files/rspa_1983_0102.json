They developed a theoretical model that takes into account irreversible loss of the reactive species by reaction on the tube wall and their reversible adsorption and desorption at the wall. The model shows that the longitudinal distribution of the reactive species becomes Gaussian eventually, and the dispersion of the reactive species increases linearly with time.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Chemical Engineering"}
