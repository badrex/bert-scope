They provide numerical solutions for the range 100-12000 of the Dean number and examine the development of a boundary-layer structure as the Dean number increases. The results show some agreement with an asymptotic model proposed by Smith (1976) but also reveal discrepancies in the precise details.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Dynamics"}
