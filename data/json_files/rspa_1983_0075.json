They establish the existence of a smooth horizon and its smooth extension in the neighborhood of the horizon. The toroidal black holes are not expected to arise in astrophysics as final configurations of gravitationally collapsed astrophysical objects due to the surrounding matter and fields having negative energy density outside the horizon.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Gravitational Physics"}
