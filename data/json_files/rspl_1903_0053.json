The authors found that these alloys can decompose water with the evolution of hydrogen at ordinary temperatures, and the corrosion begins around the edge of the aluminum-rich areas. The microscopic structure of these alloys is also examined, showing the segregation of the aluminum-rich constituent and the eutectic mixture.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Metallurgy"}
