They emphasize that the responsibility for the facts and reasonings in the papers lies with their respective authors. The Committee also addresses the practice of giving thanks to authors and exhibitors at Society meetings and discourages reliance on public notices and reports of their approval.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences, Art, and Humanities > Scientific History"}
