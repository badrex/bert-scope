The author demonstrates how to express these series as combinations of elementary functions and convergent series, providing valuable insights for computation when the radius is small. The findings have significant implications for understanding fluid dynamics and aerodynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
