He discovered that the spirit could be extracted from coal through distillation and could ignite spontaneously when exposed to air. The spirit was found to be highly flammable and could be stored in animal bladders, but not in calf bladders, as it lost its inflammability within a day. This research contributed to the understanding of coal gas and its potential uses.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Fuel Chemistry"}
