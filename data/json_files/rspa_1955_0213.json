They identified ionization processes leading to the formation of the nitrogen molecular ion in all four excited states, confirming the molecular orbital formula for nitrogen. This research is important for understanding the electronic structures of molecules and developing molecular orbital theories.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
