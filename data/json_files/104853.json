This loam is famous for its ability to withstand high temperatures without turning into glass, making it essential for various industries like brick-making, iron melting, and glass production. However, the loam is at risk of being exhausted, so Hill suggests exploring potential substitutes by analyzing its composition and comparing it to other soils.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Soil Science"}
