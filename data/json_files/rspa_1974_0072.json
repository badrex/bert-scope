They used the Cosserat surface theory to model the fluid sheet and derived appropriate equations for an ideal incompressible fluid. The resulting theory was then specialized for motions symmetric about a fixed plane, leading to a simplified mathematical structure. The authors also used a three-dimensional approximation to suggest values for the assigned vector fields and inertia coefficient, and discussed unidirectional traveling waves, finding a solitary wave solution similar to the Korteweg-de Vries equation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Mechanics"}
