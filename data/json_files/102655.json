The author shares a remarkable case where laryngotomy was successfully performed on a patient with a severe wound, saving their life. The author believes that laryngotomy should be used more often in similar situations to save lives and reduce the risk of death from respiratory issues.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Surgery"}
