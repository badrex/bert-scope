E. Roscoe and B. Stewart. They used Campbell's method to measure the heating effect of the sun and found that the heat of sunshine was greater during the second half of the year, with a remarkable uniformity in this pattern. The study also showed a correlation between solar heat and sunspot frequency, with more solar heat in years of maximum disturbance.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
