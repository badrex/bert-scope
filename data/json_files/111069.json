He introduces the concept of \"notation-limit\" and applies it to various types of numbers, such as tetrahedral, octahedral, and dodecahedral numbers. The paper also includes a new theorem applicable to all orders of series and discusses its implications for expressing numbers using different types of series.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Number Theory"}
