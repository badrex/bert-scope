The authors test two hypotheses for the direction of change and compare their findings with parallel studies of fishes. They find that biparental care was ancestral in shorebirds, with numerous independent reductions in care by males and more evolutionary lability in female care. These findings complement studies of contemporary selection and suggest that biparental incubation and freedom from feeding the young may facilitate early abandonment by either sex, particularly males.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
