The authors found that the addition of small amounts of alumina to a quartz suspension can cause the formation of thixotropic gels. The gel volume increases with the amount of alumina added, and the process is influenced by the presence of electrolytes. The results suggest that thixotropic gelation in alumina-quartz systems is similar to that observed in other colloidal systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Colloid Chemistry"}
