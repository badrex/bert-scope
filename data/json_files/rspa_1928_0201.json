They define the conditions necessary to obtain true equilibrium data and present a detailed explanation of the experimental setup and procedures. The study aims to improve our understanding of sorption theory and the practical applications of charcoal in various fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Adsorption and Porosity"}
