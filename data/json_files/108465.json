This finding expanded the understanding of diamagnetism and introduced a new force in the molecules of matter. Faraday's experiments showed that this effect occurs regardless of the strength or direction of the magnetic field, and it is distinct from both diamagnetic and ordinary magnetic actions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
