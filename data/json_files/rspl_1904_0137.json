This phenomenon can lead to ionization of surrounding gas, creating a streaming of positive and negative ions and neutral molecules. The study supports the idea that radioactive substances may extract energy from the aether and radiate it back, affecting the surrounding environment.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
