The study focuses on the disagreement between the author and other researchers on the method of production of the oral food current and the functions of the labral glands. The author presents evidence for an intermittent, orally directed food current and argues for the existence of the exit groove from the inter-limb space.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
