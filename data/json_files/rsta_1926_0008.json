The authors investigated the effects of hydrogen-air and water vapor on carbon monoxide-air explosions and explosions of methane and air at various initial temperatures and pressures. The findings provide valuable insights into the behavior of gaseous mixtures under controlled conditions, which can be applied to engine research and safety.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Chemical Engineering"}
