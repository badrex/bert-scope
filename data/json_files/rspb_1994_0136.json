They show that an animal's decision-making process can be explained by maximizing a terminal reward, which is related to Hamilton's rule. This rule helps determine the best action for an animal to take based on its own state and the state of its relative, leading to better understanding of animal behavior and evolutionary biology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
