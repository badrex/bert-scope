ESR spectroscopy has been used to analyze various animal tissues, revealing information about their metabolic differences. The technique has shown promise in diagnosing conditions like jaundice and detecting changes in cancer tissues. However, more research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms and improve the signal-to-noise ratio in ESR measurements.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
