They confirmed the theories of elastic impacts by St Venant and Hertz and found that the concept of a constant dynamic flow pressure offers a good representation of the experimental facts. The piezo-electric method also suggested that the enhanced flow pressures experienced in impact cannot be accounted for by forces of a viscous nature."}
