They discovered the separation between the principal edge and the limit of the fine structure, which helped them understand the energy necessary to remove electrons from the atom. Their findings contribute to the understanding of atomic physics and the behavior of electrons in molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
