The authors describe the isolation and properties of mutants impaired in a component of the phosphotransferase system, PtsP, and PtsX, which affect the utilization of fructose in the bacteria. The study provides evidence for two routes through which external fructose can be utilized by and transformed to fructose 1,6-diphosphate in E. coli.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
