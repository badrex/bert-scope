The J-integral method was used to measure the ductile initiation fracture toughness (JIC) of the alloys. Cobalt significantly enhanced JIC, while molybdenum, nickel, and silicon had a negative effect. The results are explained by changes in the fracture mode, stress concentration, and sulfur segregation at grain boundaries.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
