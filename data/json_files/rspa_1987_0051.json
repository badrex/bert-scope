They show that using the parameter \u03b8, where \u03b8 is the latitude, leads to a simpler and more accurate theory for expressing changes in orbital inclination and right ascension of an orbit of any eccentricity. The theory is developed for both high and low eccentricity orbits and can be used to improve the accuracy of satellite navigation.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
