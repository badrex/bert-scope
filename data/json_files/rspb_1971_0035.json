It discusses the changes in population density and growth rates of the species due to the Hunterston Generating Station's heated effluents. The research suggests that while there may be some effects on growth rates, the overall population density remains stable and is not significantly impacted by thermal pollution.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Marine Ecology"}
