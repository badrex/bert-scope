They discovered differences in their development, with Ciona showing more primitive features. The study focused on the endostyle, gill-slits, and the origin of the pericardium, providing insights into the relationships between ascidians and other organisms like Amphioxus.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
