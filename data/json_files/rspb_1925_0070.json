They found that the kidney can hydrolyze phosphoric esters to a significant extent, and the excretion of these esters is affected by factors like enzyme activity, secretory power, and the concentration of phosphates in the serum. The results suggest that the kidney plays a crucial role in maintaining phosphate balance in the body.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
