The bladder's air compresses or expands according to the depth, allowing the fish to adjust its buoyancy. The author also suggests an experiment to test whether fish move by contracting or expanding their bodies. This research could help understand the biology of fish and their adaptation to different aquatic environments.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Aquatic Biology"}
