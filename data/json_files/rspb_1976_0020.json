The neurons were studied using electrophysiological mapping techniques and intracellular injection of Procion dyes. The research provides insights into the branching architecture, axon distribution, and dendritic processes of these neurons, contributing to the understanding of neural connectivity and behavior in opisthobranch molluscs.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
