The authors calculate particle trajectories and analyze the effects of particle size, drag, and fluid dynamics on particle deposition on the cylinder. The research provides insights into the collection efficiency of particles in fluid systems, such as fibrous filters for dust and smoke.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
