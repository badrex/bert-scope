This method allows for more accurate and precise measurements of hemolysis kinetics. The author also discovers that existing equations for the kinetics of simple hemolytic reactions need to be revised due to the curvature of isometathetic lines, which were previously expected to be parallel to the abscissa.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
