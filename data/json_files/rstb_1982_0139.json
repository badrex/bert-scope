The anion exchange system is mediated by an integral membrane protein called band 3. The transport system plays a crucial role in the exchange of chloride for bicarbonate across the erythrocyte membrane, which is essential for the transfer of carbon dioxide from tissues to lungs. The authors also describe the chemical modification of binding sites and their relationship to anion recognition in water-soluble proteins and integral transport proteins.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
