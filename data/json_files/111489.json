The author describes the external features and structural peculiarities of the fish, comparing it to the recent sturgeon and explaining its homologies with teleostean fishes. The study concludes that the Chondrosteus fish is a transitional form between the Sturionidae family and the more typical ganoids, and that it lived in a tranquil sea rather than in tumultuous waters.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ichthyology"}
