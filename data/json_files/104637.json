They used a reflecting telescope to measure the appulses of the shadow to the spot on Tycho, and their observations could be useful for geographical purposes. The beginning and end of the eclipse were estimated by the naked eye and a refracting telescope with small magnification.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
