They demonstrate that the spatial extension yields qualitatively different results from the classical analysis, with lower proportions of Hawks in the population and different outcomes for strategy distributions. This suggests that spatial structure may facilitate the evolution of strategies that do not necessarily prosper in classical game theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
