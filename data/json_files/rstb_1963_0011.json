The direction and constancy of these movements are determined by the positions of the stimulating light, oral pole, and radial nerve. The findings suggest that the radial nerves play a more significant role than simple local reflex centers, resembling a more complex central nervous system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Echinoderm Biology"}
