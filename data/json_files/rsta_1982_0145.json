This approach may be significant for the formation of surface carbide atoms on metal crystallites. The researchers synthesized various carbide clusters using different reactions and techniques, providing insights into the structure and properties of these compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Transition metal chemistry"}
