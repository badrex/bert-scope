The study also showed that the teeth were one of the first parts of the body to be affected by a deficiency of antiscorbutic materials in the diet. This research helped to further understand the pathological anatomy of scurvy and its effects on the body.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Nutrition and Metabolism"}
