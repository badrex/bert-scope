They used a modified Raman tube and spectrograph to obtain clear and comparable spectra. The results showed that the intensity and positions of the lines in the spectrum changed with the concentration of the acid, which was attributed to the successive stages of ionization of the acid. The authors proposed a more detailed interpretation of the spectra, including the behavior of the continuous background and the effect of dilution on the Raman lines.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
