They found that the elastic and inelastic scattering curves were similar, and the results clarified the interpretation of the phenomena. The experimental results provided a clue to certain theoretical difficulties, suggesting that the observed facts could be explained on simple considerations involving the \"size\" of the atom.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Nuclear Physics"}
