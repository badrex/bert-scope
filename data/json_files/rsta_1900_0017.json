The authors add varying amounts of aluminium to gold and measure the freezing points of the resulting alloys. They also analyze the alloys microscopically and chemically to understand the composition and behavior of these binary alloys. The research provides insights into the formation and properties of gold-aluminium alloys, which can be useful for future material science and metallurgical applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Material Science and Metallurgy"}
