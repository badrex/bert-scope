By examining 2946 published records of the family, the authors create palaeo-geographic maps, curves of the number of records in five global regions, and cladograms of taxa and their geography. The results show that early members of the family became established on upland slopes of the north Pacific rim during the Palaeogene, with later migrations occurring in the Oligocene. The study also tests the value of taxonomic sections in monitoring the evolution of Acer through the Tertiary period.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
