They found that Mg2+ inhibits the channels by a voltage-dependent block and decreases the open-state probability. This study provides insights into the long-term regulation of ATP-sensitive K+ channels and their role in cell physiology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Physiology"}
