They found good agreement with experimental values, treating the polarization of the core and the hyperfine interaction constant as parameters. The study provides valuable insights into core polarization and hyperfine structure anomalies, which can help interpret spectra involving other rare-earth ions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
