The transient fields are obtained as the sum of quasi-static counterparts and transient correction terms, in terms of variable-separable expansions. The study finds that transient effects of dynamic loading on near-tip fields alter the universal angular variations of quasi-static field quantities for the fifth and higher order terms, suggesting that transient effects on crack-tip fields are generally less severe for a stationary crack than for a propagating crack.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanics of Materials"}
