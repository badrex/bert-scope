The authors discuss the limitations of the BDS test and propose a modified approach to better assess the independence of time series data. They also explore alternative methods for testing independence, such as the Hoeffding dependence measure and partial autocorrelations.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Statistics"}
