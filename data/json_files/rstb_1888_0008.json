They found that both male and female sexual cells originate in the ectoderm of the coenosarcal canals. The author also discovered that the young spermoblasts and ova undergo various stages of development before maturation and fertilization. This research supports the views of the Hertwigs and Weismann on the origin of sexual cells in Hydromedusae.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproduction and Development"}
