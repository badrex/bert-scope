This suggests the existence of an underlying scaling mechanism in the measles case returns, which is not purely stochastic. The study provides a novel way to consider the dynamics of other communicable diseases with frequent fade-out in case returns.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Epidemiology"}
