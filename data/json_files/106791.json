He discovered that Venus has an atmosphere similar to Earth, which is denser and more capable of weakening the sun's rays compared to the Moon's atmosphere. The author also observed a unique phenomenon where a streak of glowing light extended from the northern cusp of Venus into the dark hemisphere, which he had never seen before.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Planetary Science"}
