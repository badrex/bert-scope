They found that the critical values of the Frank-Kamenetskii parameter and the corresponding dimensionless temperature rise were slightly less accurate when using the variational method, but the errors were no greater than 0.2% for standard cases. The results showed that as the heat release rate for the second reaction increased, the stable regime was reduced, but this reduction was small for ratios of activation energies in the region.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Calculus of Variations"}
