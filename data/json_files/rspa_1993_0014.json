The results support the prediction of the Soutis, Fleck, and Smith model, showing that compressive failure is governed by plastic microbuckling of the plies. The study also compares the findings with existing theoretical models and provides insights into the mechanisms of compressive failure in notched carbon fiber composites.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
