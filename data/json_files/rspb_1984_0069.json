They discovered two types of dopaminergic cells: small to medium-sized ganglion neurons and small cells resembling small intensely fluorescent (s.i.f.) cells. These findings provide evidence that a small proportion of catecholaminergic sympathetic neurons use dopamine as their neurotransmitter.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurochemistry"}
