This transformation takes into account the quantum field nature of the electron, resulting in a Hamiltonian that is gauge-invariant, suitable for systems with multiple atoms or molecules, and useful for calculating absorption and scattering of light. The new Hamiltonian leads to Maxwell's equations with quantal sources and Schr\u00f6dinger's equation for an electron wave in an electromagnetic field.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
