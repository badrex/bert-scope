They found that calcium ions and organic bases significantly influenced brain glycolysis, while tumor glycolysis showed little dependence on calcium. The results suggest a common site of action for these substances in brain glycolysis and highlight the importance of the neuron surface in glucose metabolism.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Metabolism"}
