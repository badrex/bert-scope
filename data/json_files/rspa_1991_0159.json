They use Weyl's theory and Atkinson's result to map a point on the real line onto the Weyl circle in the complex plane. The method is applied to finding best constants in integrodifferential inequalities, and the results are compared with known analytical examples.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Numerical Analysis"}
