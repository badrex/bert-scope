They discovered that a mid-line hypothalamic tract plays a role in inhibitory control of melanophore-stimulating hormone release, and that damage to the optic system can also cause color change. The study provides insights into the complex interactions between the brain and color change mechanisms in elasmobranchs.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
