The authors find clear evidence of gyre circulation and estimate the rates of circulation on timescales from months to decades. They also present a time-series of measurements near Bermuda, demonstrating that the mixed layer is supersaturated in helium-3, which has implications for the vertical transport of materials within and from the permanent thermocline.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
