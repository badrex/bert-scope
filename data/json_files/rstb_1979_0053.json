The research finds that bird coloration has evolved primarily in response to predation-based selective pressures rather than sexual selection. The unprofitable prey model accounts for most of the variation in bird coloration, while sexual dimorphism and polygamy are more likely explained by predation risk than sexual pressures.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ornithology"}
