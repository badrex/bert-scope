The authors present efficient procedures for calculating these coefficients and provide a set of values for use in variational treatments of atoms more complex than fluorine. The article also includes expansions of a set of integrals between functions derived from single and double replacements, which are essential for atomic physics and computational chemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
