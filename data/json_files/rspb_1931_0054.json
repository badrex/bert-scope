They also studied the behavior of Trypanosoma ptyodactyli in these sandflies. The findings provide insights into the transmission and development of the parasites within the sandflies, which can help in understanding the spread of the disease.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
