He conducts an experiment with ivory balls to demonstrate that the illusion arises from our perception of the moon's distance and angle. The author suggests that our brain makes an error in judging the moon's distance, leading to the illusion of its size.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Geometrical Optics"}
