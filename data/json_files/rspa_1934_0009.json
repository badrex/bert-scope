They investigate the initial velocity of the corrosive process and how it is influenced by factors such as electrolytic solution pressure, the stability of metal ions, and the coordinating tendency of anions. They measure the rate of solution of copper and nickel in various sodium salt solutions to test their theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Coordination Chemistry"}
