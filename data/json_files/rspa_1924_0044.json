The authors demonstrate that adopting half-integral quantum numbers can increase the number of physical orbits with reality in the hydrogen atom, both in the presence and absence of an external electric field. The findings suggest that fractional quantum numbers may play a role in understanding more complex atoms and molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
