They used a guard ring condenser and a sliding condenser to compare the specific inductive capacity and refractive indices of the glasses. The results showed that the electrostatic capacity of these glasses is related to their refractive indices, providing valuable information for understanding the properties of glass used in optical devices like telescopes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
