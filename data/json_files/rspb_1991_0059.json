By analyzing the relationships between sigma factors and their functions in gene expression during spore formation in Bacillus subtilis, the author proposes a possible evolutionary pathway that involves gene duplication and divergence, leading to the increasing complexity of cell-specific genetic programs.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Bacterial Development"}
