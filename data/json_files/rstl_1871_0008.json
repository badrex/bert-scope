They discovered that by manipulating the surface area of mercury in a solution, they could generate an electric current. This process could potentially be useful in investigating the source of force in batteries and understanding the behavior of metallic surfaces in electrolytes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electrochemistry"}
