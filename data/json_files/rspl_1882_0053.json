They study the origin and growth of the Perithecium, which are globular cases containing asci, and discuss the role of setaceous appendages in the fungi's development. The author also examines the views of other researchers and the systematic position of Meliola fungi in relation to other fungal groups.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Mycology"}
