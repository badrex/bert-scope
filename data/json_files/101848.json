Halley, explains the relationship between the height of mercury in a barometer and the elevation above sea level. He also discusses the expansion of air and its connection to atmospheric pressure, weather changes, and the rarefaction of air at high altitudes. Halley provides tables to help calculate altitude based on barometer readings and explores the factors affecting atmospheric pressure.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
