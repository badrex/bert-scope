They used two actinometers to measure changes in solar energy and discussed the effects of local conditions, such as atmospheric stratus and cumulus clouds, on the measurements. The observations were taken at different times of the day to establish a time-range for inconstancy of radiation due to varying zenith distances.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
