These substances cause intravascular coagulation of the blood when injected into animals, similar to the action of nucleo-proteids. The author also investigated the effects of precipitation and redissolving processes on the substances' properties and physiological actions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
