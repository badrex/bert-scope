They found that dislocation networks are characterized by attractive intersections where two dislocations join to make one, and these intersections contribute to the flow stress. The authors also observed repulsive intersections, which are weaker obstacles to flow than attractive junctions. Their findings provide insights into the behavior of dislocations in iron and its implications for metalworking and materials science.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Crystallography"}
