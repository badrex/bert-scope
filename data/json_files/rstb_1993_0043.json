The research focuses on the ascus, ascospores, and appendages, providing insights into their development and structure. The findings reveal that the sheath and appendages in Nimbospora bipolaris have a distinct origin and sub-structure compared to other related fungi.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Mycology"}
