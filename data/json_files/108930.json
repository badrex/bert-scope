Clerk Maxwell, compares electrostatic and electromagnetic forces and demonstrates their relationship to the velocity of light. He explains that the ratio of these forces is a velocity, which is independent of the standards of length, time, and mass. This discovery is significant for understanding the propagation of electromagnetic disturbances through a dielectric medium and has implications for various applications, such as submarine telegraph cables and induction coils.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
