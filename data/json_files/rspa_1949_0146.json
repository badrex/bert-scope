The focus is on the toroidal magnetic fields generated, which are confined to the interior of the conductor and may play a significant role in terrestrial magnetism. The study provides expressions for the toroidal field and the mechanical couple produced by induction with a field parallel to the axis of rotation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
