The symptoms included nausea, vomiting, weakness, and severe pain in the limbs. Anderson also discusses the possible causes of the poisoning and the limited treatment options available at the time. The fish species involved, Sparus Pagrus, was identified as the likely culprit, though its toxicity may not be consistent across all specimens.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Marine Biology"}
