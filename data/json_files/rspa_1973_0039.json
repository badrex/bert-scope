The authors measure the variation of viscosity with load and rolling speed, finding that it tends towards a limiting value at low rolling speeds. They also examine the effects of sliding speeds, temperature, and pressure on the behavior of lubricants in elastohydrodynamic conditions. The results provide a fuller understanding of the complex processes controlling traction in these conditions and help explain the variation of traction with rolling speed.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Tribology"}
