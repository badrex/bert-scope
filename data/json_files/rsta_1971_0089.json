They discuss various approximations and sources of error in the method and provide design criteria to minimize experimental errors. The transient hot-wire method offers several advantages, including a small-volume, low-diameter cell, ease of construction, and immunity to distortion under extreme conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
