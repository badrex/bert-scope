The author demonstrates that certain points on the graph of these properties correspond to multiple states of water, and proposes a method for visualizing these relationships using a characteristic surface. The study also disproves a previous theorem by M. Verdet and provides insights into the behavior of water during phase transitions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
