(Polytetrafluoroethylene) and compared it with conventional oil-impregnated bearings. They found that the P.T.F.E.-impregnated bearings provided better performance in terms of endurance and load-bearing capacity, making it a superior material for bearing applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering > Tribology"}
