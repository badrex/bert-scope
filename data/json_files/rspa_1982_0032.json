They found that the coefficient of coagulation was higher than previously calculated values and provided a method to evaluate the coefficients of coagulation and wall loss. The study contributes to understanding the behavior of fine aerosols and their applications in various fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Aerosol Science"}
