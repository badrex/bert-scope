Using spectrum-analysis, he observed the penetration of these substances in various tissues, including the lens, cartilage, and aqueous humor of guinea pigs. The findings suggest that lithium can penetrate deeper into the tissues than rubidium.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
