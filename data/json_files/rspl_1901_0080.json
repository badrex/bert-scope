The experiments show that the arc behaves more like a non-inductive resistance as the frequency of the testing current increases. The author also discusses the effect of changing the direct current on the resistance and electromotive forces of the arc.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Electrical Engineering"}
