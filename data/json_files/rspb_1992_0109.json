By selecting for mating efficiency and measuring the correlated response in vegetative growth rate, the researchers found a negative genetic correlation between fitness components, as predicted by life-history theory. This demonstrates a net viability cost of sexual selection.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Evolution"}
