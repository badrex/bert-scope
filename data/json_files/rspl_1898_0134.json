The authors observed that anaesthetics affect the contractility of muscle fibers and the irritability of nerve cells. They also found that the effects of anaesthetics on plant cells are similar to those on animal cells, suggesting a common mechanism of action.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
