The authors found a connection between the two, with the water-level being more sensitive to changes in pressure during high-level months. The results indicate that an increase or decrease in pressure of about 1 millibar over three hours has an equal and opposite effect on the water-level. The sensitivity of the water-level to pressure is also found to be dependent on the amount of water in the well, with high levels associated with high sensitivity."}
