They found that the protein-polysaccharide complex in tunicin is similar to that in mammalian connective tissue, suggesting potential evolutionary connections. The study also examined the genetical significance of cellulose fibers' presence in aging aortic tissue and pathological conditions of the dermis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
