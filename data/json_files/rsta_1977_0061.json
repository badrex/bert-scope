The authors analyze the intensity and origin of this field, considering internal and external sources. They explore two possible mechanisms for an internal origin, including a dynamo process in a molten conducting lunar core and a surface magnetic field associated with a permanently magnetized Moon. The study provides insights into the Moon's magnetic field and its implications for the Moon's structure and history.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Planetary Science"}
