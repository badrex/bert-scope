They find that below a critical misfit level, the monolayer deforms to fit exactly with the substrate, while above this limit, the monolayer has many dislocations between it and the substrate. The energy of adsorption as a function of misfit is also calculated, becoming almost constant above the critical limit. This research is in agreement with the observation of oriented overgrowth of one crystal on another.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Crystallography"}
