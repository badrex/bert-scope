The author examines the conditions under which these waves can be excited and shows that they can be propagated with a phase velocity similar to Alfven waves. The waves are found to be circularly polarized, which is different from other hydromagnetic waves. The article also explores the nature of these waves and their relationship to plasma oscillations and the equipartition of mechanical and magnetic energy.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
