They collected data on magnetic declination, dip, and intensity at various locations using multiple instruments. The results showed a mean annual change in the dip and provided insights into the secular variation of the Earth's magnetic field in the region. The study also compared the findings with previous observations in the west of France.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
