The research found that mitotic activity is at a maximum when the animals are at rest and at a minimum when they are awake and active. This correlation helps explain the individual variation in mitotic activity and the contradictory results reported in the past regarding diurnal mitosis rhythms in mice.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology > Cell Biology"}
