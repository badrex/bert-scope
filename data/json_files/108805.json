He discovers new compounds and their reactions with various reagents, providing a deeper understanding of the connections between inorganic and organic chemistry. Debus also examines the oxidation of lactic acid and alcohol, leading to the discovery of a new compound, C5H8Ca2O7, which has properties similar to glyoxylate of lime.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
