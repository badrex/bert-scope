It compares these relationships with those of birds, revealing similarities and differences in wing area, wing loading, and aspect ratio. The results show that bats have diverse wing shapes and structures that are adapted to their specific flight styles and foraging behaviors. The study also highlights the importance of understanding these relationships for better understanding bat biology and evolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
