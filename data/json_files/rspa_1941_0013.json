They confirmed that each thundercloud has positive electricity in the upper half and negative electricity in the lower half. A concentrated positive charge below the main negative charge was observed in most storms. The generation of positive and negative charges in the main body of the cloud is attributed to the impact of ice crystals, while the positive electricity at the base of the cloud is due to the breaking of raindrops in an ascending air current.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
