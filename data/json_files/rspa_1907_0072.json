They discovered a previously undescribed dark space close to the cathode with unique properties. The authors explained this phenomenon through a theory involving the motion of electrons and their energy levels to ionize the gas. This theory was supported by the observed effects in helium and hydrogen, but not in other gases like air, nitrogen, or oxygen.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
