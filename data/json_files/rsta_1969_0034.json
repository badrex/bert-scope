It presents a detailed analysis of a single-interface wave interaction with general initial conditions, showing that six distinct types of solution exist. The study also demonstrates that stress discontinuities cannot form at the interface from initially continuous stress profiles and that each type of solution is consistent with the elastic-plastic model under a restricted set of initial conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Material Science"}
