The barometer features a stainless steel construction, optically flat and parallel glass windows, and a mercury vapor condensation pump for maintaining a vacuum above the mercury. This new design allows for more accurate observations of mercury surfaces and reduces errors caused by optical distortion.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Measurement and Instrumentation"}
