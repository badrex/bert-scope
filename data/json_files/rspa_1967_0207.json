The research explores the effects of adding Cd or Pd to silver, and the specific heat data reveal a slow rise in electronic specific heat in both cases. The results challenge the rigid band model and propose an alternative model based on a comparison of specific heats with Mossbauer data.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
