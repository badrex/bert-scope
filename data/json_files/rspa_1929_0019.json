The author finds that the modulus increases continuously from room temperature to temperatures above 600\u00b0C. The experiments reveal that the material properties of fused quartz are affected by temperature, with the modulus increasing rapidly at lower temperatures and then stabilizing at higher temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Material Science"}
