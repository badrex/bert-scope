This scale allows chemists to easily calculate the composition of neutral salts and reagents, saving time and effort in their analyses. The system is similar to a sliding rule, with numbers representing various chemical elements, acids, and compounds, making it easier to determine equivalent quantities and proportions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Analytical Chemistry"}
