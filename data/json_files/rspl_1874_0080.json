They discovered that the deformation of surfaces at the point of contact causes one surface to slide over the other, leading to resistance. The resistance is greatest when there is a larger amount of sliding, such as on softer surfaces like rubber. The author also found that reducing the coefficient of friction using oil can sometimes increase the resistance, as friction prevents the sliding and deformation of surfaces. This research helps explain the failure of using rubber for wheel tires and the superiority of steel rails over iron in terms of durability.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
