It discusses the challenges in determining the precise stratigraphic level of extinction and the various methods used to define the K-T boundary. The author highlights the importance of understanding the timing and nature of the extinction to evaluate disaster theories, such as the Alvarez hypothesis, which suggests that a meteorite impact caused the mass extinction event.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology and Paleontology"}
