He explains the process of preparing the polyps, the difficulties encountered, and the observations made from examining the dried specimens. The observations include the polyp's blood vessels, anus, mouth, and the hooks on its arms that help it catch prey.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
