They found that lipid peroxidation, particularly affecting plasmalogens, leads to a decline in sperm motility and viability. Preventing peroxide formation could be crucial for long-term sperm storage for artificial insemination.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
