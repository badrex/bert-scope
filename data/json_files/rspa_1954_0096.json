They found that the splitting of the ferric ion's state can be explained by a spin Hamiltonian containing trigonal terms of the second and fourth degree and a cubic term. No resolved hyperfine structure was found, and the overall width of any such structure must be less than 0.1 cm^-1. This study provides insights into the crystal field theory and the properties of ferric alums.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
