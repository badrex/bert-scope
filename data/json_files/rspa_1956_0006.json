Ledermann and B. H. Neumann, explore the order of the automorphism group of a finite group. They provide a lower bound for the order of the automorphism group in terms of the order of the group, confirming the conjecture that a finite group has at least a prescribed number of automorphisms if its order is sufficiently large. The study focuses on Abelian groups and their automorphisms, providing insights into the structure and properties of these groups.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Group Theory"}
