They find that gene frequencies vary more in areas with lower population densities, suggesting that isolation is the main cause of these variations. The study also reveals a correlation between the frequency of consanguineous marriages and population density, which can be used to predict the amount of genetic variation due to random sampling.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Population Genetics"}
