He made significant contributions to the understanding of the asymmetric carbon atom and its role in optical isomerism. Marsh's research on camphor and related terpenes helped advance the field of stereochemistry, and his work on the history of chemical discovery added to the unique identity of the Oxford Chemistry School.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
