They demonstrate that a range of 'puckered' four sub-lattice arrangements have the same energy, and calculate the interactions between the ions to predict the ordered nuclear state and Neel temperature. The nuclear electric quadrupole interaction and exchange interaction are also discussed.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
