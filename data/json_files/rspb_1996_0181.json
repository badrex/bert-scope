The research shows that territorial males have a thousand times greater reproductive success than non-territorial males, suggesting that males should fight to become and remain territorial. The ability to win fights and be territorial depends on energy reserves, which are correlated with the age of the individual. The findings provide an alternative explanation for the outcome of conflicts in animals, focusing on the energetic constraints of males and their ability to obtain a territory.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Insect Behavior"}
