The authors analyze the rates of various reactions, including nitrous oxide, hydrogen peroxide, and ethane, and discuss the differences between the theories based on their assumptions and experimental results. They find that Slater's theory often provides a better explanation for the rates of energization, suggesting that there may be limited energy flow between the normal modes in some molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
