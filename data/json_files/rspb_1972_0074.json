The research finds that the presence of a supernumerary molar in front or the absence of the third molar at the back is due to threshold mechanisms. The findings do not support or disprove the inactive X-chromosome hypothesis. The study also discusses the complexities of molar development in tabby animals, including the occurrence of extra teeth and the impact of competitive relations between teeth.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Development"}
