The author suggests that if a developing country can make glucose-electrolyte packs available and acceptable in every village, and simple rehydration units available at health centers, it will be better equipped to handle cholera and other diarrheal disease outbreaks.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Public Health"}
