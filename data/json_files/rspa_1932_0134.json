It discusses the work of John Dalton, who discovered the partial combustion of methane and ethylene, and the development of the hydroxylation theory. The author presents experimental methods and findings on the slow combustion of various hydrocarbons, including methane, ethane, ethylene, and acetylene, which support the hydroxylation theory. The article highlights the importance of understanding hydrocarbon combustion for applications in aircraft and vehicle engines."}
