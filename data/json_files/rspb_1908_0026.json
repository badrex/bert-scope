They found that the maternal placenta contains a considerable percentage of glycogen, which decreases as pregnancy progresses. The study also revealed that the fetus's liver starts to store glycogen later in pregnancy, while the placenta plays a crucial role in providing nutrients to the developing fetus.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
