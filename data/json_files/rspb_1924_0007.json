The researchers found that changes in blood pH, caused by breathing in carbon dioxide or taking ammonium chloride, led to increased inorganic phosphate levels in the blood and urine. The study also showed that increased acid excretion and diuresis played a role in these changes. These findings help to understand the body's response to acidosis and the role of inorganic phosphate in human metabolism.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
