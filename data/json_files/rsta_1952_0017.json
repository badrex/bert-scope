They prove that any bounded reducible star set contains a closed irreducible star set with the same critical determinant, and they also show that if the original set is bounded by a finite number of algebraic surfaces, the irreducible set will also be bounded by a finite number of algebraic surfaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Geometry of numbers"}
