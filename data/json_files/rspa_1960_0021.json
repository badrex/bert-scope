The research covers a wide range of strain, stress, and temperature, revealing different stages of flow and the effects of stress reversal. The findings provide insights into the behavior of metals under stress and the role of crystal structure in their deformation.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
