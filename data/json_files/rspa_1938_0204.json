The authors develop a general theory of concentration overpotential and investigate oxygen deposition from fused sodium hydroxide, finding that the observed overpotential due to concentration changes is consistent with the general theory. They also discuss the relationship between current density and concentration, introducing the concept of the diffusion layer and its impact on electrode reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
