Simon made significant contributions to low-temperature physics, including the solidification of helium and other gases by high pressures, the discovery of specific heat anomalies in solid orthohydrogen, and the development of cryogenic technologies. His work in low-temperature physics and atomic energy made him a leader in the field, and his influence extended to the development of scientific education and public affairs."}
