The author analyzes various shapes, including double conical rods and double paraboloids, and provides formulas for calculating nodal ratios and periods of vibrations. The study contributes to a better understanding of the behavior of vibrating rods and has implications for engineering applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanics"}
