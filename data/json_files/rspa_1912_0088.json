They observed that the removal of water vapor from the gas produced a significant change in the motion of negative ions. The results showed a large increase in lateral diffusion as the pressure decreased and the electric force increased. This phenomenon is connected to the tendency of ions to assume the electronic state.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
