The research shows that certain morphs are associated with particular habitats, such as discontinuously opaque unbanded forms on exposed sand, heavily-banded forms on dark substrates, and continuously opaque morphs with few bands in turfy habitats. The frequencies of these morphs are influenced by visual selection, with predation by rooks being a major factor. The study also analyzes supergene and gene frequencies in relation to habitat and latitude, identifying different kinds of selection that affect the snail's polymorphism.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Environmental Science"}
