The results show that nitrogen peroxide has a dual effect on the ignition process, inhibiting the reactions leading to cool flames and promoting direct oxidation. Large amounts of nitrogen peroxide can also exhibit an anti-catalytic influence, possibly due to self-neutralization of active centers.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Combustion Chemistry"}
