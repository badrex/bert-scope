The author explains the technical challenges and the use of mathematical and physical modeling techniques to predict performance and test the burner's reliability. The burner has been successfully applied to various furnace types, leading to significant energy savings and reduced costs.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Energy Efficiency"}
