Crookes, conducted experiments to analyze the effects of radium stimulation on the spectra of bromine and helium. He found that radium stimulation did not elicit the characteristic line spectra of either element. The faint line previously described as a radium line was found to be due to aluminum. The author suggests further experiments to determine if helium can be stimulated by radium."}
