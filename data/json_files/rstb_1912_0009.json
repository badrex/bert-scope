These implements were found in association with bones and other artifacts, suggesting that the area was once inhabited by prehistoric humans. The discovery challenges previous ideas about the antiquity of human tools and the knowledge of flint chipping.", "scientific_discipline": "Archaeology > Paleolithic"}
