They show that the interaction between the two fields and the population inversion leads to stable oscillations and bistable behavior between two stable states. The results provide insights into the dynamical behavior of bidirectional ring lasers and the role of population inversion in their operation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
