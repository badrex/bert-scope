They discuss two main applications of the trace formula: periodic-orbit sum rules and the Selberg zeta function. The authors also explore the convergence properties of the relevant series and the role of long periodic orbits in chaotic systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics", "sub_discipline": ">-"}
