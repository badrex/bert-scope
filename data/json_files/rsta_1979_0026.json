The authors argue that a substantial part of the uranium and gold in these conglomerates is associated with diagenetic pyrite precipitated in situ and allogenic fragments of diagenetic pyrite. The study provides a petrographic analysis of pyrite, which reveals various forms and textures, suggesting a multi-stage history of ore enrichment.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Sedimentology"}
