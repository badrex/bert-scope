It explains the difference between passive diffusion and active transport, and the role of transport carriers in controlling the rates of ionic and molecular transport. The article also highlights the specific properties of sugar transport systems and their importance in cell metabolism and behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
