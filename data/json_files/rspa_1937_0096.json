The authors demonstrate that the elastic structure of dough is primarily due to gluten, and suggest that the branched protein chains of gluten act as springs, while electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged groups of neighboring molecules form insecure links. The addition of hydrochloric acid reduces the strength of the gluten network, supporting the importance of electrostatic attraction in its structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Food Science"}
