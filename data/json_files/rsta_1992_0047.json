The authors explore the chemical reaction rate vector, composition of explosives, and their application to steady-state detonation. They analyze the detonation performance of different explosives, including Composition B3, RDX emulsions, and PBX W115, and discuss the effect of morphology on ideality.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
