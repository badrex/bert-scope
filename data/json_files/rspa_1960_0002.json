The authors discuss the influence of bulk dielectric effects and intermolecular interactions on band intensities and find that the significance of these factors varies in different cases. They also explore the behavior of vibrational chromophores in different solvents and the role of specific molecular interactions in shaping band intensities.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
