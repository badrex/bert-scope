They found that edge and screw dislocations in one crystal create terminating half-lines in the moir\u00e9 pattern, allowing for the observation and analysis of dislocations in metal lattices. This technique has potential applications in understanding lattice imperfections and their effects on mechanical properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
