The results show that virtually all cells in the inoculum can form colonies, and the distribution of adaptation rates among single cells is consistent with the appearance of early colonies on plates with high inocula. This suggests that it is unnecessary to propose that early colonies develop from special cells or that there is an essential discontinuity between early starters and the bulk of the population.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
