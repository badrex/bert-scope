The author presents results describing the precise form, number, and location of singularities in the unphysical domain as the wave height increases. These findings can be used to calculate water waves numerically in an efficient manner. The study of singularities in these flows helps to understand their ill-posedness and the potential effects of regularization on their time evolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics > Fluid Dynamics"}
