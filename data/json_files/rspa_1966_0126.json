They demonstrate that this approach is applicable when the wavefunction is expanded in terms of the eigenfunctions of the quasi-molecule formed by the colliding systems. The study focuses on symmetrical charge transfer and shows that the semi-classical treatment predicts damping of oscillations in charge transfer close collisions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
