Desaguliers, presents a simple experiment to confirm Sir Isaac Newton's theory of different refrangibility of light rays. By using a candle, two prisms, and a mirror, the experiment demonstrates how light rays are refracted differently, resulting in the formation of distinct colors. This experiment also explains how our eyes perceive different colors and how they are separated when passing through a prism.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
