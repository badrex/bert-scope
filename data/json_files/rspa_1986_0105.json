The authors find that a proportionally greater increase in the disturbance is needed when reactant consumption is considered, compared to the classical problem of thermal explosion. The study focuses on a two-dimensional slab of exothermic reactant and uses a series expansion to analyze the dynamics of ignition.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
