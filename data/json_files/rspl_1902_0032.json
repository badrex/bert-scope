The authors found that the sensitivity to flicker increases as the image on the retina moves towards the periphery, and the perception of motion is closely related to the perception of flicker. The research also highlights the importance of eye movement control in accurately perceiving the disappearance of flicker.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Visual Perception"}
