It identifies and describes different types of neurons, including pyramidal, large stellate, and small stellate cells, and their characteristics. A quantitative analysis of these cells in both cortical areas reveals similar proportions of each type of neuron, providing evidence that large and small stellate cells form distinct populations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
