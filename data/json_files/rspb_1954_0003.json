The fluid also contains other substances like fructose, ergothioneine, and potassium citrate. Inositol and citrate play a role in maintaining osmotic pressure in the seminal vesicle secretion and semen of the boar. The study provides information on the chemical composition of the vesicular secretion, including the presence of various carbohydrates, amino-sugars, proteins, and minerals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
