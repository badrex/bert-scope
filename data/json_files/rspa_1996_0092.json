They interpret significant slope changes in electrical resistance measurements as indicative of this phase transition, which they believe is due to the disordering of a flux lattice vortex solid. This research contributes to the understanding of the behavior of superconductors and the nature of the transition between different states.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Superconductivity"}
