They discovered that the rust fungus could infect different species of Bromus under controlled conditions, and that the growth of pustules was excellent on some species. This research provides insights into the relationship between the host plant and the parasite.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Pathology"}
