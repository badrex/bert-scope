They discovered that light stimulates nitrogen fixation by providing photochemically produced ATP, which is required for the process to function efficiently. This research helps to understand the relationship between photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation in these organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Photosynthesis and Plant Physiology"}
