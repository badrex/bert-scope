They discovered that the bacteria produce toxins called proto-albumose and deutero-albumose, which have strong alkalinity in solution. These toxins are poisonous and can cause illness and death in animals. The authors also found that the anthrax bacillus forms an alkaloid from the albumose, which may explain the toxic properties of the albumoses.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
