The results indicate that the changes in the horizontal needle's intensity are due to a daily variation in the amount of dip rather than a variation in the general intensity of the Earth's magnetic force. This supports the idea of a small variation in the position of the magnetic axis due to the Earth's rotation and the influence of the Sun on the magnetism of the Earth's parts.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
