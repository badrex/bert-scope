They found that after denervation, muscle fibers become hypertrophic with an increased number of myofibrils and myofilaments. Later, the fibers atrophy, mainly due to fragmentation and disintegration of myofilaments. This research provides insights into the subcellular components involved in muscle atrophy and denervation processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
