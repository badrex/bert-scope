They highlight the problem of synonymy in species descriptions, which has been overlooked in assessments of the levels of taxonomic effort required to describe a substantial proportion of the world's species. The authors use the insect order Thysanoptera as a test case, demonstrating that a significant proportion of species descriptions have been later falsified, leading to a substantial underestimation of the amount of work necessary to establish a foundation of descriptions. They suggest that a greater emphasis on collaborative exploration of particular geographical areas of high species richness and the development of databases and information systems could help address the issue.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Conservation"}
