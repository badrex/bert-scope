They also explore the effects of magnetism on light and its relation to the electromagnetic theory. The results suggest that fresh air and light can help in disinfecting the tubercle bacillus, while darkness may interfere with this process. Further research is needed to understand the full implications of these findings.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology and Infectious Diseases"}
