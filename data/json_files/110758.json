The study found that the curves representing the law of rise and fall of the water were different for high and low tides and did not follow the line of sines. The author also explained a perplexing circumstance regarding the age of the tide, which is different when inferred from the height of the high water or from the time of high water.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Coastal processes"}
