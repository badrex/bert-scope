The development of these polymers has led to applications such as high-tensile-strength fibers and thermoplastically processable plastics. Functionalization of liquid-crystalline polymers involves the introduction of properties like color, polarity, and conductivity, as well as changes in mesomorphic structures. Doping is a common method for functionalization and structural variation, which has been applied to various liquid-crystalline systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
