They describe the unique cartilage development and cranio-facial features of myxinoids, which provide insights into the evolution of vertebrates. The study highlights the importance of these lowly evolved fish in understanding the morphology and development of the vertebrate skeleton.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Vertebrate anatomy"}
