It discusses the modern fauna's abundance and diversification, the evolutionary history of the Antarctic benthos, and the three models of evolutionary processes that may have shaped the polar biotas. The article highlights the complexity of understanding the origin and adaptation of the Southern Ocean marine fauna, emphasizing the need for further research to predict the effects of present global warming on the existing fauna.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Marine Biology"}
