The authors found that the degree of adsorption is affected by the solubility of the corresponding active compounds and the type of precipitate. They also discovered that radium D is more readily adsorbed in acidic solutions, while radium E is more adsorbed in neutral solutions. The results indicate that isotopic precipitates do not have a greater adsorptive power than non-isotopic precipitates.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Radiochemistry"}
