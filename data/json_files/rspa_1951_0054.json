They find that the chemisorption is reversible even at liquid-air temperatures and that the conversion proceeds through a chemical mechanism. The results provide insights into the stability of chemisorption and the mechanism of the catalytic parahydrogen conversion.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
