They discovered that the molecular complexity of sulfur changes with temperature and pressure, with two distinct absorption spectra corresponding to S8 and S2 molecular systems. The study also revealed the dissociation process of sulfur vapour at varying temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
