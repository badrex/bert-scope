The telescope's equatorial mount allows smooth and steady movements, and its optical power is tested with various celestial objects. The committee recommends equipping the telescope with a photographic apparatus to capture images of the moon, planets, and stars. The telescope is deemed perfect for its intended purpose, and Mr. Grubb is instructed to prepare it for shipment to Melbourne.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
