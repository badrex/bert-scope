They achieved energy resolution of around 0.1 eV, which allowed them to resolve rotational fine structure in the spectra. The study focused on the ionized molecular species and their vibrational excitation, providing insights into the molecular structure and behavior of hydrogen and oxygen.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
