The author presents an approximate treatment using a parabolic barrier to predict the behavior of such systems. The study also discusses the differences in reaction velocities of isotopes, particularly hydrogen and deuterium, due to mass and zero point energy differences.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
