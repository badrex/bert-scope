The research focuses on primary and repeated infections, examining factors such as parasite survival, host mortality, and the impact of acquired immunity and genetic heterogeneity. The findings provide insights into the control of infections with medical and veterinary significance.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
