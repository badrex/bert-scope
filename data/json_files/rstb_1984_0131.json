The hsp70 protein was found to have multiple interactions with cellular components, including a transient association with nucleoli in stressed cells. This study provides insights into the functions of hsp70 and its role in cell stress response.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
