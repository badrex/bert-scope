The research focuses on the effects of photosynthesis on phytoplankton in tropical freshwaters, providing insights into primary productivity in these habitats. The findings reveal that these waters have strong diurnal changes in temperature and density stratification, which affect the vertical distribution of photosynthesis-related changes.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Limnology"}
