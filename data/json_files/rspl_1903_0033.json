The authors found that the insula, a part of the brain, is larger in anthropoid apes compared to lower apes, making it more similar to the human brain. They also discovered that faradization of the inferior frontal convolution did not elicit consistent movements, suggesting that the Broca \"speech center\" may not exist in these brains or that direct faradization of this area is inefficient in evoking vocalization. The study also discusses the recovery of movement after ablation of the motor cortex and the influence of \"Bahnung\" on movement sequences.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
