They focus on the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) and its potential to activate cellular oncogenes in mammary tumors. The study identifies a gene called int-1 as a candidate cellular oncogene for mammary tumors, which is activated by proviral integration and transcriptional enhancement.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Molecular Biology"}
