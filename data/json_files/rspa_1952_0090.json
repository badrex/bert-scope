They studied the effects of energy, voltage, capacity, gas nature, and pressure on the energy distribution and total output. The results showed that the energy emitted is independent of wavelength, and the energy distribution is independent of the gas filling, gas pressure, and energy input above certain critical limits. The findings contribute to understanding the mechanism of production of the continuum and the application of the gaseous flash discharge in photochemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
