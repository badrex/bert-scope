The authors compare geochemical data from various basic volcanic rocks and propose that the convecting upper mantle, rather than lithospheric mantle, is the primary source for these intraplate magmas. They suggest that small-degree melting of l.i.l.e.-depleted mantle sources containing l.i.l.e.-rich streaks can account for the unique geochemical signatures found in intraplate volcanic rocks.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Tectonics and Volcanology"}
