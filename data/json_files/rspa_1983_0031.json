The author demonstrates how to translate complex integrals into simpler twistor diagrams, which can be used to represent the scattering amplitudes in a manifestly finite manner. The results justify the elegant diagrammatic formula originally written down by Penrose for this example.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
