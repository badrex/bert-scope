He served in World War I, where he was exposed to the effects of anoxaemia on soldiers at high altitudes. After the war, Kellaway conducted groundbreaking research on the effects of anoxaemia on the human body, focusing on blood sugar levels and the role of the brain, adrenal medulla, and liver cells. His work established him as a promising experimental physiologist and laid the foundation for further research in the field.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
