They demonstrated that changes in firing correlation between neurons occur in relation to sensory stimuli and behavioral events, even without modulations of firing rates. The study calls for a revision of prevailing models of neural coding that rely solely on single neuron firing rates. The authors conclude that the neuronal transients model does not provide a simpler explanation of their results and cannot explain them without deviating significantly from most rate code models.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Neuronal Coding"}
