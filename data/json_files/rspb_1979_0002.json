It found that neighboring neurons in isolated cortex tend to discharge in near synchrony, while in the intact brain, there is a random temporal relation between the firing times of adjacent nerve cells. These findings may indicate the manner in which biologically important information is transmitted within the mammalian brain.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
