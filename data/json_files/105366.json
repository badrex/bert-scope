He hypothesizes that Tripoli is formed from petrified wood that has been calcined by subterranean fire. Hubner also discusses the possibility of a deluge contributing to the accumulation of wood in the mountain. This research provides insight into the geological processes behind the formation of Tripoli and the role of volcanoes in its production.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
