They found that the spheroidal assumption provides an accurate representation of the drop's shape, and the calculated distribution of pressure and fluid velocities match experimental measurements. The results provide a better understanding of the dynamics of drop disintegration and its implications in cloud physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
