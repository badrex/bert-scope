They found that the temperature of no crystallization is not a constant for all bodies, and the heat capacities of solids and liquids should be determined at the same temperature, preferably the fusion point. This research provides a better understanding of the properties of substances and their phase transitions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Thermodynamics"}
