He discovered that the poison is not in the teeth, tail, or gall of the viper, but in two vesicles covering their teeth. The poison is a yellowish liquid that causes harm when introduced into a wound. Redi also found that swallowing viper poison does not cause harm and that sucking the wound is an effective treatment for viper bites. He debunked common beliefs about the effects of viper poison and salt, and challenged the claims made by Aristotle and Galen.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Herpetology"}
