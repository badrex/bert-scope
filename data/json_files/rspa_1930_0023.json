They found that the structure of the films depends on the nature of the anions present in the buffer solutions rather than the acidity of the solution. The results indicate that the films are not those of the amines alone but of their salts with the acid radicals present in the water. The study provides insights into the behavior of surface films and their structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
