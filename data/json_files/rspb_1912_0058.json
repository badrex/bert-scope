They discovered that prunase is responsible for the resolution of simple cyanophoric glucosides and found that it occurs in both leaves and fruits of Prunus species. The authors also introduced the use of prunasin as a test for prunase, which is an important advancement in enzyme research.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
