They found that selenic acid has a close relationship to sulfuric acid and that concentrated selenic acid can be crystallized and separated from its liquid state. The authors also investigated the conditions for concentrating selenic acid in a vacuum and compared it to the concentration of sulfuric acid.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Acid Chemistry"}
