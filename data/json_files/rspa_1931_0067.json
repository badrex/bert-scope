They found that the corrosion rates of zinc and mild steel varied with the conditions, and the difference between them increased with time. The results showed that the corrosion rates were not solely controlled by the rate of oxygen supply to restricted cathodic areas, and that the effect of changing the atmosphere on corrosion rates was not yet fully understood.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
