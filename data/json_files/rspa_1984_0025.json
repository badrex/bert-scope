They consider the parameters that are important in controlling and defining the scattering angle and analyze the importance of angular collimation before and after collision. The authors describe a modification to a double-focusing mass spectrometer to observe angle-resolved ion kinetic energy spectra of collisionally scattered ion beams and present preliminary results on non-fragmenting systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
