Messier, a member of the Royal Academy of Sciences, discovered a new comet in January 1771. He observed its position, motion, and appearance, and shared his findings with the Royal Society. The comet was difficult to find due to cloudy skies and its faint light, but Messier managed to locate it again after several attempts. He also noted that without the telescope provided by M. le President de Saron, he would not have been able to perceive the comet with his instruments.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
