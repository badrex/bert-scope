This process suggests that the virus remains alive after being inactivated, and the inactivated virus can be restored to full activity under the right conditions. The study also indicates that only some filtrates of the virus are vulnerable to oxidation, hinting at the possible involvement of a third substance in the process. This research contributes to the understanding of virus inactivation and reactivation, with implications for future studies on viruses and their behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Virology"}
