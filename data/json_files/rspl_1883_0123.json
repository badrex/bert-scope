The hourly means for each month are plotted, including the effects of disturbances that influenced the measurements, particularly in winter months. The author highlights the impact of easterly disturbances on the increase of mean declination.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
