This effect, caused by free carriers moving in a solid, is a relativistic phenomenon. The results show a small change in the refractive index due to the electron motion, which is of interest for understanding the interaction between light and matter in semiconductors.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
