The researchers found that removing the pituitary gland caused the frogs to remain pale with contracted melanophores and expanded xantholeucophores. This suggests that the pituitary gland plays a direct role in controlling pigmentary response in frogs.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
