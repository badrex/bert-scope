The authors found that cavities and air bubbles can cause a transition to fast reactions in nitroglycerine and help sustain it through various processes, such as adiabatic collapse, increased burning surface area, and jetting. The research also explores the importance of confinement and the presence of discontinuities in the explosive.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
