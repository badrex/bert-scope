This method allowed them to obtain protein-free antibodies, which they tested with diphtheria antitoxin and antityphoid serum, demonstrating the effectiveness of the technique. This discovery had significant implications for the study of antibodies and their applications in medicine.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
