They observed ten electronic Raman transitions in PrCl3 and determined the frequencies of five Raman-active vibrational modes in both PrCl3 and LaCl3. These findings provide valuable information for understanding the energy levels and lattice vibrations of these materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystal Physics"}
