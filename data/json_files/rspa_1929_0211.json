They develop a mathematical theory of refraction in dense media that accounts for the anisotropy of the polarisation field and apply it to experimental results. The study shows that the proposed expression accurately predicts the refractive index and dielectric constant of benzene, demonstrating the importance of considering molecular anisotropy in understanding the optical properties of liquids.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
