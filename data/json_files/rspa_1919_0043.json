The authors found that oxygen and water in the pyridine solution can hinder the extraction process, and they provide methods to purify and dehydrate the pyridine for better results. They also discuss the importance of coal's fineness and temperature control during the extraction process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
