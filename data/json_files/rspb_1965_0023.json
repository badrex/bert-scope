They found that the amount of transmitter released is related to the frequency of nerve stimulation and that blocking agents can increase the amount of transmitter appearing in the venous blood. This research provides insights into the mechanisms of adrenergic transmission and its role in the sympathetic nervous system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
