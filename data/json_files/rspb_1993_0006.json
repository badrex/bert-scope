The researchers found that these insertions, mainly single 1.15 kb KP elements or two KP elements in tandem, are located between the TATA box and the transcription start site of the Gpdh gene. These insertions cause a reduction in GPDH mRNA and are the most likely cause of the low GPDH activity observed in these variants.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Molecular Biology"}
