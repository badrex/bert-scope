They explain that the motion of atoms in a crystal can be described as a superposition of traveling waves, and they calculate the intensity of the scattering based on the molecular Fourier transform and the structure factor. The study provides insights into the lattice dynamics of molecular crystals and helps in understanding their crystal structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
