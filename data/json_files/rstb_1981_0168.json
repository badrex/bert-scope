It explains how these nerves work together to control the secretion and flow of saliva, and how they cooperate in the formation of primary saliva. The article also explores the phenomenon of augmented salivary secretion, which demonstrates the functional relationship between motor and secretory mechanisms in salivary glands.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
