They used a new research method to examine the transmission of spectra by these substances and found that terpenes with a higher number of carbon atoms have a greater absorptive power for more refrangible rays. The process of dilution with alcohol allowed them to detect the presence of aromatic compounds in essential oils. This research has implications for dynamo-electric machine construction.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
