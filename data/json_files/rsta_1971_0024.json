They suggest that the geotherm intersecting the mantle solidus at the base of the upper mantle creates a partially melted layer, which is less dense than the overlying lithosphere. This leads to gravitational instability, breaking up the lithosphere into plates and allowing for the escape of melted material. The process results in the formation of mid-oceanic ridges and the thinning of lithospheric plates, compatible with various continental margins and ridge/trench convergences.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology", "sub_discipline": "Plate Tectonics and Seafloor Spreading"}
