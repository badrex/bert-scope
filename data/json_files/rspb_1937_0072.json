They found that the insect is strongly attracted to the smell of its host and can be conditioned to prefer specific host species. This conditioning could play a role in the development of biological races within insect species that breed on multiple hosts. The study provides insights into the complex relationship between insects and their hosts and the factors that influence their interactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
