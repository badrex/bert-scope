The research shows that a similar stereochemical motif is recognized by acidic mollusk shell macromolecules interacting with four different organic calcium phosphate-containing crystals. These findings may have implications for understanding the control of crystal growth in carbonate apatite crystals found in vertebrate tissues.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biomineralization"}
