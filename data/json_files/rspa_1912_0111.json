They also discuss improvements in polarimetric apparatus used to measure the optical rotation of sugar solutions. The study finds that the reaction rate increases with decreasing water-to-acid ratio, and the author suggests that the change in concentration mainly affects the acid's activity.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
