It focuses on the work of James David Forbes, who proposed that glaciers flowed like viscous fluids, and the debates with other scientists like Louis Agassiz, William Hopkins, and John Tyndall. The article also highlights the connection between glacier research and the development of the mechanical theory of heat.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
