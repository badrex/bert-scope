They compare seed mixtures, which combine toxin-free and toxin-containing plants, and refugia, separate fields of toxic and toxin-free crops. The study shows that seed mixtures may actually hasten insect resistance compared to pure stands of toxic plants. The authors recommend using refugia as a better strategy to conserve insect susceptibility.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
