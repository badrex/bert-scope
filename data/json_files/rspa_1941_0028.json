It also explores the effect of long-chain polar compounds on the coefficients of kinetic friction. The research shows that oriented metal films have higher catalytic activity and that long-chain polar compounds can improve the friction between surfaces by creating a \"wedging effect.\" The findings have implications for the development of better lubricants and wear-prevention agents.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Surface chemistry"}
