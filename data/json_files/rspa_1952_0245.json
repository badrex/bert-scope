The authors argue that plastic deformation is more likely than suggested by Professor Blok, especially with rough surfaces and non-parallel ridges. They also highlight the importance of elastic deformation of surface irregularities in hydrodynamic lubrication.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
