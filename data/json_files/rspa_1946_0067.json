They apply this method to various problems, including stress distributions due to forces, couples, and pressure in isotropic and non-isotropic materials with different boundary conditions. This approach simplifies the solution process and provides new insights into stress analysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics", "sub_discipline": ">-"}
