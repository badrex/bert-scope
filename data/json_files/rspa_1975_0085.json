The researchers found that the attenuation in zinc and cadmium is highly anisotropic, while it is nearly isotropic in magnesium. They also observed screening breakdown in cadmium and analyzed the rapid fall in attenuation just below the transition temperature to determine the London penetration depth, coherence length, and average Fermi velocity in these metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
