The authors conclude that different types of greenness in oysters are caused by varying amounts of copper and iron, and that sea water is inimical to the growth of the typhoid bacillus. They also discuss the presence of other bacteria, such as the colon group and B. enteritidis sporogenes, in oysters.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Marine Biology"}
