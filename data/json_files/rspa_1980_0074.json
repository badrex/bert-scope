It highlights the contributions of key researchers and their experiments, particularly the work of Brinkman, Dixon, and Meechan, who used Cu3Au to distinguish between vacancy and interstitial migration. The author reflects on the progress made in the field and the challenges faced during this period.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
