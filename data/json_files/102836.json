The child was unable to breathe properly and had difficulty in digestion. Upon dissection, it was found that the intestines and mesentery were situated in the chest cavity, pressing on the heart and lungs, causing breathing difficulties. The child was nourished despite the abnormal anatomy, leading to further investigation into the mechanisms of nutrition and communication between the digestive system and other organs.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy"}
