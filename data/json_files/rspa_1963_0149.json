The cross-section increased linearly with electron energy and reached a maximum value of 3 at 200 eV. A semi-empirical formula proposed by Drawin described the measured cross-section within the experimental error limits when the two adjustable parameters took the values of 0.5 and 1.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Atomic Physics"}
