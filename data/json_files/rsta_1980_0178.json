It explores the dependence of galaxy formation on the spectrum of primordial density fluctuations and the mean mass density of the universe. The author also examines the correlation functions and the hierarchical distribution of galaxies, as well as the effects of dissipation and other factors on galaxy formation.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Cosmology"}
