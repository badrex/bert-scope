The researchers demonstrate that these cells act on the effector stage of contact sensitivity and can be induced following in vitro exposure to antigen. They also show that the activity of suppressor cells is specific and that mice can be made unresponsive by injecting lymphoid cells treated with the suppressing agent, picryl sulphonic acid, in vitro.", "scientific_discipline": "Immunology > T cell regulation"}
