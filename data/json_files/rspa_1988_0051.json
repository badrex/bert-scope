The authors simplify the key multidimensional integral using Chebyshev polynomials and calculate the microstructural parameter for an equilibrium distribution of cylinders. The results improve upon second-order bounds and provide good estimates of conductivity for various phase conductivities and volume fractions.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
