The first mechanism involves the action of the detergent on free phospholipid in the cell wall, while the second mechanism is similar to how most haemolytic agents act. The study provides insights into the structure and maintenance of the red blood cell wall and the equilibria involved.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
