The complexes enhance the reactivity of aromatic rings, allowing for the controlled addition of nucleophiles and substitution reactions. The article also explores the influence of directing groups and the use of lithiation, electrophilic quench, nucleophilic displacement, and silane blocking-fluoride deblocking reactions in the synthesis of specific polysubstituted aromatics.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
