The accidents occurred when workers entered old, abandoned areas of the mine, where fires had been burning for years, releasing toxic fumes. The Royal Society received this report from Sir R. Moray, who shared the story from the Earl of Weymes, a relative of the mine's owner.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Mining Safety"}
