It evaluates the efficiency of various animal species and systems, considering their feed conversion rates, lifetime productivity, and adaptability to available resources. The author suggests that a reduction in the importation of feeding stuffs and a decline in the contribution of animal foods to the human diet may be necessary for long-term food policy planning.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Agricultural Sciences"}
