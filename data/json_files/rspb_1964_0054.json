The authors propose a model for the arrangement of myosin and actin molecules in muscle filaments, explaining the role of cross-bridges and the contraction process. They also describe the structure of actin filaments and their interaction with heavy meromyosin, providing evidence for the presence of actin in thin filaments of striated muscle.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
