This phenomenon occurs when light is reflected from metallic surfaces and undergoes a physical change that is intermediate between completely polarized and unpolarized light. The author also finds that the angles of reflection for elliptic polarization can be represented by the variable radius of an ellipse, making it distinct from circular polarization. This discovery expands our understanding of the interaction between light and metals and may be incorporated into the theory of circular polarization in the future.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
