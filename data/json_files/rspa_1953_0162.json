They found that the number of collisions needed for a molecule to take up one quantum of vibrational energy runs parallel with the value of the lowest molecular vibration frequency. The study provides insights into the factors determining the collision life of vibrational energy in molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Acoustics"}
