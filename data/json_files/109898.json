Rennie discusses the limitations of previous research and shares his findings on the differences in strength between various types of iron and the unreliability of specific gravity and hardness as indicators of strength in stones. He also observes the formation of pyramids during the rupture of amorphous stones.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Material Science"}
