The authors collected psychophysical data and conducted nonlinear analysis to determine whether the variability in dominance durations is due to a stochastic process or deterministic chaos. The results show that the data does not exhibit the characteristics of a chaotic system, suggesting that chaos is not a major factor in binocular rivalry.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Psychology > Perception"}
