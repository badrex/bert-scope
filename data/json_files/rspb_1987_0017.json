The fossils, including those of Iguanodon, were found in a cavern-like deposit at a quarry. The clays in which the fossils were buried have been dated as Aptian (Lower Cretaceous) and are similar to those found in the Wealden Formation of southeast England and the Bernissartian of southwest Belgium. The article discusses the excavation, conservation, and analysis of the fossils, and provides insights into the possible causes of the mass accumulation, such as flash floods or mudslides.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Paleontology"}
