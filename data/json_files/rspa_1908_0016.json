They found that the scattering of beta-rays is influenced by the atomic structure of the material and can be represented by a mathematical equation. This research provided insights into the interactions between subatomic particles and atoms, which is essential for understanding nuclear physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
