They found that event frequency shows similarity with VITA threshold and averaging time, enabling an objective method for selecting these parameters. The study also revealed that conditional averages from the similarity region are similar to those from low Reynolds number laboratory flows, indicating the existence of coherent events at various Reynolds numbers.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
