The majority of the minerals analyzed are derived from basaltic rocks native to Mare Crisium, with a small proportion of highland material present as glass fragments in the fine fractions. The findings provide insights into the composition and origin of lunar regolith material.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
