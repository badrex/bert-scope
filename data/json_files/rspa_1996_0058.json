They derive the constrained Lagrangian and Hamiltonian equations of motion for a general non-relativistic classical mechanical system with constraints. The numerical integration of these equations is discussed, and constraint errors are avoided using simple correction schemes. The authors demonstrate the efficiency of their methods by applying them to a periodically driven inverted n-linked pendulum.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Computational Mechanics"}
