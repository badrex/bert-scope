He demonstrates that by dividing the refraction between multiple eyepieces, the indistinctness of the image can be reduced. Dollond's innovation led to the development of telescopes with six lenses, which provided a larger field of view and improved image quality.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
