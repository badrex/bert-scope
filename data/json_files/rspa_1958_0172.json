They used a cavity resonator refractometer to directly determine the refractive index of the air near the interferometer, improving the measurement of the free-space wavelength and frequency. This research led to a more precise determination of the free-space velocity of electromagnetic waves.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
