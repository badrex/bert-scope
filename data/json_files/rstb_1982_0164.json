They analyze the effects of perturbations in cellular Na+-K+ balance on the transport of secretory and membrane glycoproteins and study the composition of the Golgi complex and its subcompartments through analytical subcellular fractionation. The findings provide insights into the divisibility of the Golgi complex and its potential role in intracellular transport.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
