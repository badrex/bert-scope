The bacteria benefit from this transformation as they can use the opines for their growth and proliferation. This phenomenon represents a new type of parasitism, where the parasite introduces genetic information into the host, forcing it to produce compounds that only the parasite can utilize.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
