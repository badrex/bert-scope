They determined the three-dimensional structure of actin, examined the mechanism of actin polymerization, and investigated the regulation of actin polymerization by binding proteins. They also tested the physiological functions of myosin-II using monoclonal antibodies, which inhibited amoeboid locomotion when microinjected into living cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
