The experimental results show that polar vapours have larger second virial coefficients than predicted by the principle of corresponding states. This deviation can be explained by the hypothesis that polar vapours undergo partial association due to dipole interactions or hydrogen bonding. The authors used this hypothesis to create a theoretical treatment for the mixtures and compared it to the experimental results.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Thermodynamics"}
