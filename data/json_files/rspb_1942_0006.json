They discover a new derivative, rhodopterin, which has properties similar to pterins and is formed from pterins or certain related compounds. The study also reveals a connection between pterins and uric acid, a substance found in mammalian tissues and possibly with physiological functions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
