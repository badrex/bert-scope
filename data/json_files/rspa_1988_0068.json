The collision results in the development of a null surface acting like an event horizon, and the metric has been analytically extended beyond it. The behavior of null geodesics is analyzed, showing that all null particles in the interaction region cross the horizon and escape to infinity, and the connection between focusing and the creation of horizons and singularities is investigated.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Gravitational Waves"}
