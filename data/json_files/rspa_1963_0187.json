They used two independent methods, one with a pulsed light source and pulse-sampling oscilloscope, and the other with a modulated light source and phase and modulation fluorometer. The results were analyzed to determine the six rate parameters that describe the behavior of the system, providing insights into the fluorescence properties of pyrene solutions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
