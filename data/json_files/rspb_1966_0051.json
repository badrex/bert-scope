It found that the sensory field of the bipolar cells in the dorsal epithelium of each segment of Nereis virens overlaps the two segments on either side. The research examines the possible role of the sensory input in the locomotion of normal worms and suggests that the overlapping sensory fields may play a significant part in the peripheral and central control of locomotory movements.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
