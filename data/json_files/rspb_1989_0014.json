The ultrastructure of the muscles and the control of degeneration are discussed, revealing differences from other muscle degeneration mechanisms. The findings contribute to understanding the role of killer cells in the vertebrate immune system and the degeneration processes resulting from disuse.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology and Histology"}
