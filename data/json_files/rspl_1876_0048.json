They developed a method to illuminate the drops at different stages of their impact, allowing them to observe and analyze the patterns formed. The study focused on the behavior of mercury and milk drops, providing insights into fluid dynamics and surface tension.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
