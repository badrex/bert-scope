The authors explore the molecular mechanisms controlling the expression of these genes and their role in inflammation, maturation of mononuclear phagocytes, and genetic variants and deficiencies of complement proteins. The study examines the synthesis, processing, and regulation of complement components C2, C4, and factor B, providing insight into the molecular regulation of the immune system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
