It highlights the differences in encoding faces between young children and adults, and how the inversion effect increases with age. The author argues that part of the improvement in face recognition is due to the acquisition of knowledge specific to faces, which cannot be applied as efficiently to inverted faces.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Cognitive Development"}
