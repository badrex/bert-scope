The authors assign specific resonances in the NMR spectrum to different amino acid residues and investigate the effects of lanthanide cations binding to the protein. They find that the solution structure of lysozyme is similar to the X-ray crystal structure, but with some differences due to internal motion and sidechain group mobility. The study also provides information on local conformational changes in the active site of lysozyme upon binding of protons, metal ions, and inhibitors.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
