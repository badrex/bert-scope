They found that the pitch of harmonium reeds is affected in the same direction as tuning forks, with a very nearly twice the amount, that is, by about 1 in 10,000 vibrations for each degree Fahrenheit. This discovery is important for understanding and adjusting musical instruments in different temperature environments.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Acoustics"}
