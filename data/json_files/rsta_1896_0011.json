The research revealed that the presence of impurities in metals can significantly affect their elasticity, and the atomic volume plays a crucial role in determining the metal's properties. The study also highlighted the importance of understanding the structure and molecular composition of metals and alloys to predict their behavior under different conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Metal Alloys"}
