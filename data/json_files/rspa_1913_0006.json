They discovered that hydrogen crystallizes in the regular system, forming needle-shaped crystals, while the solidification of oxygen is a more complex process involving a viscous liquid phase and slow crystal growth. The authors also observed a transformation of oxygen into a fine-grained crystal mass with strong double refraction.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid-state physics"}
