The research investigates various bird species, including domestic fowls, ducklings, and nestling starlings, to understand the different types of feathers and their growth patterns. The findings provide insights into the evolution of feathers and their relation to reptilian scales, as well as the phylogenetic sequence of events in feather development.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
