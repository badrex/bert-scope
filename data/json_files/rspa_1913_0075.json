By using a liquid hydrogen calorimeter, he discovers that the mean atomic specific heats can be represented as a periodic function of the atomic weights. This research contributes to the understanding of the relationship between atomic structure and thermal properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
