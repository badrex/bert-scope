The author presents a mathematical model to determine the conditions for stability and applies it to various glider configurations, including single and multiple plane laminae. The study provides insights into the design of stable gliders and the potential dangers in experimenting with unstable configurations.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Aeronautics"}
