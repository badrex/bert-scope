The authors analyze three models of partial preference, including the O'Donald and Charlesworth encounter models, and compare their frequency-dependent relations. They also explore the implications of frequency-dependent expression of female preference and its impact on male sexual advantage.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
