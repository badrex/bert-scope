It explores the significance of symbiotic events in the origin of eukaryotic cellular organization and the potential for symbiosis to create directed evolutionary changes. The author also introduces the term 'cytobiosis' to describe the process of intracellular symbiosis and discusses the various ways in which symbiotic relationships can affect the evolution of organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
