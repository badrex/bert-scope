The device relies on the principle that the surface of all liquids, when free from external causes and in communication with each other, will be in a horizontal plane. This innovation aims to prevent shipwrecks and loss of life due to inaccurate observations caused by obscured horizons.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Navigation"}
