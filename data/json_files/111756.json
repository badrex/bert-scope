This compound is similar to the hydrate of phenyl but has distinct properties, such as being almost insoluble in aqueous ammonia. The author also describes various chemical reactions involving hydrate of cresyl, including its reaction with nitric acid, sulfuric acid, and pentachloride of phosphorus.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
