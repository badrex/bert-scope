The authors found that the energy required to produce an ion in air is 1.90 x 10^-10 erg, and that the energy radiated from radio-active substances is significant, with uranium oxide radiating at least 0.032 calorie per year for every gramme of the substance.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Ionization and Radiation"}
