They found that the anisotropic part of the crystal field changes with temperature due to thermal expansion of the crystal lattice. The spin-orbit coupling coefficient had to be decreased by 20% from its free ion value, indicating some overlap between the d and s charge clouds. The theoretical values agreed well with experimental results within the limitations of the approximations used.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
