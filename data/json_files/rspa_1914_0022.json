They discovered that the spores of certain bacteria, when in suspension, exhibit a unique behavior where they form a layer at the air-water interface and become immobile. This immobility is independent of temperature and occurs in different liquids. The authors provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon and discuss its implications for understanding Brownian movement.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
