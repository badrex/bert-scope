They find that the bright line inside the edge of the filament is due to reflection, while the dark line outside the edge is attributed to diffraction. The authors also conclude that the effect of reflection is negligible, and the bright line can be explained by deviations from Lambert's cosine law of emission on the part of the tungsten filament."}
