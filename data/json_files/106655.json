They discovered that acids with different strengths freeze at different temperatures and that the strength of the frozen part approaches that of a specific value, 411. The author also found that oil of vitriol has a strength of easiest freezing, meaning it can freeze with a relatively small amount of cold. These findings contribute to the understanding of the properties of acids and their behavior during freezing.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical properties and reactions"}
