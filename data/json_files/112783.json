The survey was carried out under the supervision of Captain Frederick John Evans and involved observations of the Earth's magnetic field. The results are presented in maps and tables, accounting for the secular change in the magnetic field between the observation dates and the epoch of 1842-5.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
