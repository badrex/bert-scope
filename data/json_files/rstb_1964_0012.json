It focuses on the origin, structure, and segmentation of the mesoderm, as well as the formation and breakdown of coelomic sacs. The research provides a detailed description of the early development stages and offers insights into the beetle's unspecialized nature, which may have exopterygote affinities.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Insect Development"}
