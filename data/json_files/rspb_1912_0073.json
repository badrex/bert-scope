They find that a higher infant mortality rate is associated with a lower child mortality rate, suggesting that natural selection is more intense in areas with higher infant mortality. This study provides insight into the impact of environmental factors on human survival and evolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Human Evolution and Genetics"}
