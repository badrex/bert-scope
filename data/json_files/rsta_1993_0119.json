The author presents a theoretical model for these interactions, which takes into account the geometric properties of \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and out-of-plane \u03c0-electron density. Experimental evidence and applications of the model are provided, including the design of a synthetic molecular receptor that recognizes p-benzoquinone using hydrogen bonds and edge-to-face \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions. The article also explores the role of aromatic interactions in the sequence-dependent structure of DNA.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
