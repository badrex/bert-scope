These models involve the role of gravity, geotropic reactions, and hormone oscillations. The author suggests conducting experiments in space under free-fall conditions to test these models and better understand the mechanisms behind circumnutations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
