It discusses the closure of the Iapetus Ocean, the configuration of Laurentia, Baltica, and Great Britain, and the plate tectonic associations of terranes that make up New England, Britain, and Variscan Europe. The article also examines the width of the ocean separating Laurussia and Gondwana and whether a late Devonian Pangaea existed.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology", "sub_discipline": "Paleogeography and Paleoclimatology"}
