The model allows for the correlation of rain cell parameters, such as intensity and duration, and can be used to fit second-order properties taken from time-series records. The model is useful for hydrological studies that require long records of multi-site rainfall data.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Hydrology"}
