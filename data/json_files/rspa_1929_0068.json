The authors used two independent methods to approach equilibrium from both synthesis and decomposition of methyl alcohol, and they describe the design and operation of the high-pressure apparatus used in their experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Equilibrium and Reaction Kinetics"}
