He discovered that the diamond, when ignited, continues to burn in oxygen gas after being removed from the lens's focus. The gas produced during combustion was found to be chemically identical to that produced in the combustion of common charcoal. The diamond's combustion resulted in the formation of carbon dioxide gas and no other solid or liquid byproducts.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Analysis"}
