The research focuses on the population's age and sex structure, marital status, fertility rates, and reproductive patterns. The findings reveal a marked recent population expansion with a predominance of younger age groups, and a higher fertility rate compared to other communities in the region. The study contributes to understanding demographic trends in isolated communities and the impact of external factors on their population dynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences > Demography"}
