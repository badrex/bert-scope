The unfertilized egg plasma membrane is excitable due to the presence of voltage-regulated calcium and potassium channels. Sperm-egg interaction elicits a fertilization potential, which involves calcium influx and further depolarization of the membrane. Calcium channels play a crucial role in egg activation, axis formation, and polarity expression in the zygote.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
