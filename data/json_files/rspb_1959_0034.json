The authors found that all species have a similar wall structure made up of numerous lamellae containing random microfibrils in an amorphous matrix. They also discovered that none of the red algae species contain cellulose I and that the presence of crystalline floridean starch complicates the X-ray diagrams in some species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
