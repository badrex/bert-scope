The authors apply the asymptotic approximation method to study the dispersion relation, rays, polarization states, and transport laws for these waves. The findings have implications for understanding phenomena such as gamma rays, gravitational waves, and early universe processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetic Theory"}
