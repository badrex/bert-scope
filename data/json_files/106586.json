This method allows for easy and quick recording of star positions, making it easier to detect any changes or variations in the appearance of the stars. The author suggests that if each astronomer takes care of a constellation, the collective effort would lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the night sky.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
