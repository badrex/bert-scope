The main focus was on determining temperature and hygrometric conditions of the air. The author also explains the instruments and methods used, such as barometers, thermometers, and hygrometers, to collect accurate data during the balloon ascents.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
