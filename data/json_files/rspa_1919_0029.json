They analyze seismograms and barographs to determine the cause of the explosion and the types of waves involved. The author concludes that the first impulse was a seismic wave, while the second impulse was caused by the air-wave of the explosion. This study highlights the importance of understanding the propagation of explosion waves in the earth and the air.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Seismology"}
