This method allowed them to record scattered particles at various angles simultaneously, reducing the time needed for experiments and providing a more detailed analysis of the scattering processes. The authors tested this method on protons and deuterons, demonstrating its effectiveness in studying high-energy particle scattering.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
