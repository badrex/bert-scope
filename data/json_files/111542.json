The initial force of gunpowder is found to be impulsive, and the author suggests that quick-burning powder is better for short-range ordnance. The current theory, which focuses on the secondary force of the elastic fluid, is deemed insufficient for ordnance construction, leading to issues with large guns. The author proposes a new formula for the initial force of powder and discusses the implications for gun design.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical engineering"}
