They found that the ratio of calcium to sodium in the blood affects the composition of milk, with calcium causing a decrease and sodium an increase in permeability. This study provides insights into the regulation of milk composition and the role of electrolytes in the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
