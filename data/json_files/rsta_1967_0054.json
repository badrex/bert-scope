They use a method that considers a formal asymptotic solution of the form and apply it to equations with matrix functions of and an -component vector. The method involves solving first-order partial differential equations, linear systems of ordinary differential equations, and transport equations along space-time curves called rays. This research has applications in various fields, including electromagnetism and plasma physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Partial Differential Equations"}
