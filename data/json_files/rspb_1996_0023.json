The model suggests that the silk consists of a structured fibril tube surrounding a thin core, which could explain its supreme tensile strength. This finding challenges the general view of spider silk structure and provides insights into the unique properties of this biopolymer.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
