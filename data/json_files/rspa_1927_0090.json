The author finds that the average additional magnetic variations during magnetic disturbances do not differ much in type as the intensity varies. The study focuses on the local-time diurnal variations and storm-time changes, concluding that the average characteristics of slight and intense disturbances are similar in type.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Magnetosphere"}
