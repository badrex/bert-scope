He discusses the latitude and longitude of Ponoi, the effect of parallax on the moment of the contact, and the geocentric latitude of Venus. Mallet also shares his experiments with a pendulum, comparing the lengths of pendulums in different locations, and his observations of the magnetic needle's declination. Lastly, he mentions the importance of accurate observations for the advancement of magnetism theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
