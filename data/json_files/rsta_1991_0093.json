It discusses various mechanisms for particle acceleration, such as direct electric field acceleration, stochastic acceleration, and shock acceleration. The article also highlights the role of coronal mass ejections and current sheets in the acceleration process and presents a model for energetic particle production in solar flares.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
