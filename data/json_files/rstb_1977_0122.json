The research provides detailed descriptions of the histology and ultrastructure of the tissues and discusses their morphogenesis, growth, and adaptation to function. The findings contribute to understanding dipnoan interrelations and the evolution of their skeletal tissues.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Vertebrate Paleontology"}
