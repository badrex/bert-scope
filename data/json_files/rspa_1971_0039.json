They introduce an invariant I, which can be evaluated as an expansion in proper time, and use it to estimate the extent of diffusion in the gravitational field. The study also explores the relationship between the sharpness of the solution and the metric of the space-time, and the potential application of Huygens' principle in Einstein's theory of gravitation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > General Relativity"}
