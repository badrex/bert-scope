The bacteria, identified as Pseudomonas radicicola, are responsible for nitrogen fixation, allowing Myrica gale to thrive in nitrogen-deficient environments. This finding expands the list of non-leguminous plants capable of nitrogen fixation through root nodules.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
