The authors develop equations of motion and boundary conditions to analyze the impact of wind and atmospheric pressure on the water's surface elevation and current components. They consider the establishment of a steady state and the decay of initial disturbances, providing insights into the behavior of ocean currents and tides under various meteorological conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
