It investigates the energy transfer from the eddy to the edge of the plate in a non-attenuating coupled wave mode, resulting in a scattered sound field with increased intensity. The study considers the effects of fluid-plate coupling and provides an asymptotic solution for the scattered field in the limit as fluid loading effects tend to zero. The findings show that the intensity of the edge scattered field radiated by a steel plate in air can exceed the intensity radiated directly by the turbulent eddy by up to 18."}
