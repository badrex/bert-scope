They discovered that the method used by Dr. Thomson involves an error, which prevents an accurate result even with pure materials. The author also found that when solutions of muriate of baryta and sulphate of potash are mixed, a small portion of the latter escapes decomposition and adheres to the sulphate of baryta. This error has significant implications for Dr. Thomson's research on the equivalents of various elements.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Analysis"}
