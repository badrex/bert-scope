The author demonstrates how this problem can be applied to various mechanical problems, such as Poinsot's herpolhode, central orbits, the spherical catenary, and elasticity. The article also explores the transformation of elliptic functions and their coefficients, which are essential for understanding the dynamics of these systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
