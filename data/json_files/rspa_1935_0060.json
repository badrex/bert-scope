The study finds that chemisorption of hydrogen causes a decrease in the amount of van der Waals adsorption, and deuterium is more strongly sorbed than hydrogen. The research also explores the activation energy for sorption and the equilibrium between chemisorbed hydrogen, methane, and hydrogen gas. The findings suggest that the process of sorption involves both activated adsorption and non-activated diffusion.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface chemistry"}
