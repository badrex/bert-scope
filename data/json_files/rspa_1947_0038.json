The material transitions from a tetragonal structure at room temperature to a cubic structure at around 120\u00b0C. The study found that the unit cell retains its identity throughout the transition, with the atomic parameters remaining unchanged. The specific heat has not been determined, but the thermal expansion curve has a characteristic A shape, suggesting a typical A-point change. The article also explores the possibility of a second transition point below room temperature, where the structure may revert to a cubic form.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
