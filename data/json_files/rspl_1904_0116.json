The cone, named Sphenophyllum fertile, has both dorsal and ventral lobes that are fertile, unlike other known forms. The author also compares the cone to other related plant genera and discusses its potential implications for plant evolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleobotany"}
