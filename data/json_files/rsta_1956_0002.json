They find that the large-scale components of turbulence dominate the motion during the final stages of decay, and the energy distribution follows a power-law form. The results provide a theoretical basis for understanding the properties of turbulence and comparing them with experimental observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
