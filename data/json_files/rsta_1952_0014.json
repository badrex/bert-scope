Submarine Talent. The survey aimed to gather data to help solve various geological problems in the region, including the islands of Malta and Pantelleria, the island arc of Crete and the southern Aegean, and the large positive isostatic anomalies in Cyprus. The results provide valuable information for understanding the tectonic and geoid features of the area.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
