They discovered that the relaxation is highly sensitive to the orientation of lamellae and can be influenced by factors such as irradiation and cooling rate. The experiments support a model where the relaxation is due to slip at lamellar boundaries, and the authors discuss the implications of their findings for understanding the behavior of polyethylene materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Science"}
