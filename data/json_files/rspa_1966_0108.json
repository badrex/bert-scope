The authors used a Fourier transform spectrometer to measure the spectra and assigned frequencies to the stretching mode of the hydrogen bond and the torsional mode in the monomers. The results provide insights into the behavior of hydrogen bonding systems in alcohols and can be compared with other chemical compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
