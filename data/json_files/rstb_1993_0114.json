The study finds that the Jurassic world was relatively equable compared to today, with strong seasonal contrasts in temperature within continental areas and monsoonal effects on the continents. The results of this research are consistent with climate modeling experiments that assume a higher atmospheric content of carbon dioxide during the Jurassic period.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Paleoclimatology"}
