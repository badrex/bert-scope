They describe the design and use of a spectrometer based on their analysis, focusing on field homogeneity, probe design, transient circuit behavior, Johnson noise, nonlinear analysis, phase-sensitive detection, and signal processing. The authors also introduce a cyclically ordered phase sequence (CYCLOPS) to simplify quadrature Fourier transformation. They demonstrate the spectrometer's performance with spectra obtained from cesium and phosphorus resonances.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
