It highlights the importance of metal ions, like iron, in facilitating the formation of hydroxyl radicals, which contribute to the damage. The authors propose that these radicals are a major damaging agent in inflamed rheumatoid joints, and their formation is facilitated by the release of iron from transferrin in the joint's micro-environment.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Chemistry"}
