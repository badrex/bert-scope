The authors describe the mechanism of degradation, which involves a depolymerization process, and find that the overall quantum efficiency of the photo-degradation reaction is greater than 1. They also measure the number-average molecular weights of degraded samples, providing insights into the reaction kinetics and the effect of temperature on the degradation process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Science"}
