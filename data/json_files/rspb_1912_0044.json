They discovered two types of peroxydases in plants, epidermal and bundle peroxydases, which play a role in the formation of flower color. The research also sheds light on the phenomenon of dominant whites and ever-sporting strains in flowers, which are characterized by the sporadic appearance of color patches on a white or self-colored ground.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
