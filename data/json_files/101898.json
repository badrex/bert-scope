Halley, conducted an experiment to estimate the amount of water vapor raised from the sea by the sun's warmth. He found that a small area of water can evaporate a significant amount of water in a short time, and that this evaporation could account for the Caspian Sea's stable water levels and the Mediterranean Sea's currents. The experiment also suggested that the amount of water vapor evaporated from the sea is much greater than the amount contributed by rivers.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
