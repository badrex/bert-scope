The authors examine the behavior of the electron distribution function and test wave dispersion to identify the mechanism behind the instability. They find that the instability is associated with trapped electrons and that the system is stable for certain plasma parameters. The study also explores the effects of varying wave amplitude on the instability and provides insights into the transition from fluid to kinetic instability."}
