Salvadora is a woody plant that can grow as a tree, shrub, or bush. It has unique features such as a cup-shaped structure with four lobes and produces berries with a single cell or lodgment. The plant has various uses, including treating scorpion bites, washing children to maintain health, and feeding camels.
