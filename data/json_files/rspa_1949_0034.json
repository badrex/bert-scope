The authors observed new phenomena, such as the \"crack\" and the \"black ring,\" and analyzed the initial velocity of water rise, the pressure of shock waves, and the formation of domes and central columns. The findings provide a better understanding of the complex behavior of water during underwater explosions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
