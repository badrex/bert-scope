They found that the vibration amplitudes and lattice-vibration spectrum agreed well with previous experimental and theoretical studies. The temperature dependence of the atomic vibration amplitudes was also investigated, providing insights into the crystal's thermal properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
