They found that these metals have high resistivities and complex temperature relations. The resistance-temperature curves of uranium and neptunium are unusual, with positive temperature coefficients decreasing monotonically with rising temperature. The results provide insights into the properties and potential applications of these actinide metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Material properties"}
