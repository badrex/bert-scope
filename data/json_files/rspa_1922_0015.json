The authors conducted experiments using a more accurate and intense source of radiation, and their results support Rutherford's nuclear model of the atom. The findings show that the number of electrons per atom is equal to the atomic number of the element, which is a significant confirmation of Rutherford's model.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
