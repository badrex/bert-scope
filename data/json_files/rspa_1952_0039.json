They show that by employing specific 5-rowed and 10-rowed representations of -matrices, the number of primitive divergent graphs can be reduced. The divergent graphs are identified as meson self-energy, photon self-energy, vertex parts, -parts, and scattering of light by light graphs. The author explains how these difficulties can be overcome and the renormalization of the theory can be achieved.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Field Theory"}
