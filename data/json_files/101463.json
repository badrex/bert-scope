One case involves a student who had obstructed pores due to spending many nights outdoors, leading to a subcutaneous water accumulation. The other case is about a young girl who ate salt excessively, causing her to become stiff and ultimately starve to death. The author also mentions a blood-letting procedure and its potential connection to a patient's diet and leprosy risk.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Human Physiology"}
