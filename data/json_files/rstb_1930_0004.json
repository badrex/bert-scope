They examine the formation of the atlas, axis, and occipital segments, as well as the role of the notochord and the development of the central nervous system. The study provides insights into the early stages of mammalian embryonic development and the formation of the musculoskeletal system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
