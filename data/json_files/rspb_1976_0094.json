They confirmed previous anatomical findings and provided electrophysiological support, showing that as one moves anteriorly along V3, receptive fields move closer to the midline, representing the vertical meridian. This study contributes to the understanding of visual processing in the brain.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Visual Processing"}
