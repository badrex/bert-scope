They found that factors such as absorption, back-scattering, and scattering from the spectrometer walls can affect the distribution curve. The authors also observed two well-defined lines at 710 and 1.37 MeV, and evidence of a less intense but incompletely resolved line at 0.88 MeV, which are produced by internal conversion in the Ra E decay process.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
