The author develops equations to understand the balance between centrifugal force and pressure gradient in air motion. They also discuss the impact of temperature gradients on upper air pressure and the effect of the Earth's surface on wind velocity. The study compares observed wind velocities with calculated values from pressure measurements, finding that the upper wind generally aligns with isobars at the surface and that the effect of the surface on wind velocity varies depending on the locality.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
