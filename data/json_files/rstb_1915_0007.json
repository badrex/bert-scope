This challenges the theory of natural selection and adaptation, as the endemic species do not seem to have evolved in response to local conditions. The study also suggests that Ceylon and Southern India may have been part of a larger landmass in the past.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Botany"}
