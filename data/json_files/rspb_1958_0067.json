They found that hill breeds have a higher frequency of the haemoglobin A and high-potassium genes, while lowland breeds have a higher frequency of the haemoglobin B and low-potassium genes. The study provides insights into the genetic variation and population genetics of these characters in sheep.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
