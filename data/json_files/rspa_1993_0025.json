They prove that if a symmetric matrix has a non-zero isotropic null vector, then the trace of its adjugate vanishes. This theorem has implications for the study of wave propagation in thermoelastic materials, where isotropic wave amplitudes are associated with repeated roots of the characteristic equation.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Linear Algebra"}
