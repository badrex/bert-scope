They discovered that the reaction rate is influenced by factors such as solubility, volatility, and temperature. The author also investigated the reaction between mercuric chloride and potassium iodide, finding that it occurs at a much faster rate than the reaction between lead chloride and potassium iodide.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Solid-state chemistry"}
