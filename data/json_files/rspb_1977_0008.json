Scanner and its Impact on Healthcare", "semantic_tags": ["Medical Imaging", "X-ray Technology", "Computerized Tomography", "Diagnostic Techniques", "E.M.I. Scanner"], "tldr": "The E.M.I. scanner, a machine that employs computerized tomography, allows for the differentiation and measurement of soft tissues' density, overcoming limitations of conventional X-ray technology. By scanning through the patient in a transaxial plane, the E.M.I. scanner provides a series of tomographic slices, offering a more accurate and detailed view of the body's interior, improving diagnosis and disease detection.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Medical Imaging"}
