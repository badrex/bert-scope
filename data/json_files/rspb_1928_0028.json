They found that seed fats from plants belonging to the same or similar botanical orders often contain similar and specific mixtures of fatty acids. The study focuses on four botanical orders: Palmaceae, Myristicaceae, Cruciferae, and Umbelliferae, and their unique fatty acid compositions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
