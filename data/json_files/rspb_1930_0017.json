They used the nucleal reaction to test if these structures were chromatinic in nature. The results showed that the secondary nuclei did not contain chromatin, and the germ-cell determinants appeared to be differentiation products of the cytoplasm, unrelated to the secondary nuclei. This research provides insights into the complex processes of oogenesis and cell biology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Cell Biology"}
