The author constructed a steam calorimeter to investigate the effect of temperature on the specific heat capacity of carbon dioxide at different densities. The results show that the specific heat capacity decreases with increasing temperature, supporting theoretical predictions made by Rankine and others.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Thermodynamics"}
