The impurity is heavier than nitrogen and is removed by passage over red-hot iron. The gas has no smell and its solubility in water is much higher than other atmospheric gases. The author also discusses the analytical use of hypobromite for the determination of metals and the possible contamination of nitrogen prepared by the action of chlorine on ammonia.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Gas Chemistry"}
