The research finds that each species accumulates a distinct spectrum of metals, with the extent of accumulation being primarily determined by the species rather than the concentration available in the environment. The metals are compartmentalized within mineralized granules and residual lysosomal bodies, acting as cellular detoxification systems. The findings suggest that feeding characteristics and other aspects of behavior and physiology play a significant role in determining the amounts of metal accumulated by these marine creatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Marine Biology"}
