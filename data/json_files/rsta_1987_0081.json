They analyze the equation's behavior for small values of the dissipation coefficient and provide asymptotic solutions for -wave and sinusoidal initial distributions. The study sheds light on the physical mechanisms and balances involved in the modified Burgers equation and its applications in various fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics", "sub_discipline": "Partial Differential Equations"}
