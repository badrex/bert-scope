When space-time is asymptotically flat, the conservation equations are cast into tensor form, and invariant integral conservation laws are derived. These laws suggest possible definitions of the 4-momentum of a system in terms of four invariant integrals, which can be used to distinguish between radiating and non-radiating systems. The Landau-Lifshitz conservation equation is considered more useful due to its symmetry, leading to further invariants related to angular momentum.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > General Relativity"}
