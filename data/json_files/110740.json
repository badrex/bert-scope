He found that the prevailing winds, rain, and temperature were influenced by the moon's declination. North-east and south-east winds were most common when the moon was near the equator or moving towards its maximum north or south declination. The average annual rainfall in London was 25.17 inches. Howard also observed that atmospheric pressure and temperature were affected by the moon's position, with slight increases and decreases in temperature depending on the moon's declination.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
