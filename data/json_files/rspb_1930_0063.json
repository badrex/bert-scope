The intense red color produced by the reaction between ferrous salts and dipyridyl allows for colorimetric estimation of iron. This method is advantageous for studying iron in living material and does not require other more sensitive reagents. The author also discusses the properties and applications of the dipyridyl reagent, such as its stability, solubility, and reaction with various metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
