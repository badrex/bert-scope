The author uses branching processes to determine the polymer distribution and provides criteria for the existence of an infinite aggregate (a gel) and the distribution of finite aggregates (the sol). The study also discusses the challenges of incorporating ring-formation into graph-theoretic models.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Graph Theory"}
