They found that floral asymmetry in both pollen donor and recipient plants is positively related to embryo abortion rates, suggesting that both maternal and paternal plants affect embryo failure. This indicates that pollinator preferences for symmetrical flowers may contribute to selective abortion of developmentally unstable embryos in plants.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
