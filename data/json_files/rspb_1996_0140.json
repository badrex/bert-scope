The researchers found that certain silicate minerals, such as amphiboles, can induce pathogenic processes in living systems. They monitored changes in the surface chemistry of these minerals and observed modifications in the chemical composition of aluminum, magnesium, and iron, which may contribute to the biological effects of silicates.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Mineralogy and Crystallography"}
