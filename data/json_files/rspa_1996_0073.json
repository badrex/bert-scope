They explore properties of these measures, including their multifractal spectrum and dimensions, and provide examples of self-similar vector measures. This work extends the understanding of multifractal theory to vector situations, which is useful for representing features of vectorial form in various scientific fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Analysis"}
