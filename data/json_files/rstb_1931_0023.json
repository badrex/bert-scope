This substance, which they named 'Z', contributes to the high acidity and carbon content in non-volatile acids produced by these fungi. They also found that 'Z' is present in solution, partly free and partly as a complex that breaks down upon hydrolysis with acids.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
