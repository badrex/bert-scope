The authors used equipment for recording wave forms and direction-finding of sources of atmospherics in Johannesburg and Durban. They found that the wave forms consist of a ground pulse followed by a series of reflected pulses, which supports the idea that the radiation field from a lightning discharge is of a simple character. The study also highlights the merging of pulses at distances of around 300 km, which is an important feature in understanding atmospheric wave forms.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atmospheric Physics"}
