They discovered that the interior of the arc always showed a fixed permanent pressure, about a millimeter of water above the surrounding atmosphere. The author discusses various possible causes of this pressure, such as motion of gas particles, transit of material from pole to pole, or a succession of disruptive discharges.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
