They found that fast sodium action potentials caused large increases in internal sodium concentration in the soma and axon, while dendrites showed smaller amplitude action potentials. The results confirm and extend the description of channel distribution and electrical signaling in Purkinje cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
