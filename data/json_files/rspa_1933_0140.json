The author suggests a theory of adsorption and examines the properties of modified crystals containing impurities. The study compares the properties of \"adsorption bodies\" and mixed crystals, providing evidence of the structure and orientation of impurities within the crystals.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
