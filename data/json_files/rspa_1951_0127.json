This method promises to be useful in applications to meson theory and aims to provide divergence-free equations of motion applicable to any problem. The authors also discuss the physical and heuristic ideas underlying the transformation method and its potential for practical use and approximate numerical calculations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Field Theory"}
