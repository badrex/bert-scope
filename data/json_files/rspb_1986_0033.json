The results showed that these anti-configurations bind in a manner consistent with the planar diol-epoxide ring being inclined at approximately 90 degrees to the DNA axis. This binding is different from regular intercalative interaction and may be significant in understanding the molecular interactions preceding cancer.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
