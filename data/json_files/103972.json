The author, J.T. Desaguliers, explains the physics behind the centrifugal force and how it affects the air movement. He also calculates the pressure and velocity of the air, which can reach up to 68.53 feet per second, or about 7 miles in 9 minutes.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical engineering"}
