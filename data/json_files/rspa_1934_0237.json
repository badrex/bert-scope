They used a magnetic spectrograph and a sensitive coincidence counter to measure the end points of the thorium bodies. The results showed that the maximum energies liberated in the two branches of thorium C balance, in agreement with the prediction of Ellis and Mott.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
