They explore the steady motion and vibrations of these vortices, providing mathematical expressions for their velocity, energy, and time of vibration. This research connects to the vortex atom theory and the explanation of spectral lines of elements.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
