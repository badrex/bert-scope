Norman Lockyer and his team used prismatic cameras to study the solar corona and prominences. They obtained photographs that showed the spectra of hydrogen, calcium, and other elements in the solar atmosphere. These observations provided valuable insights into the structure and behavior of the sun's outer layers.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
