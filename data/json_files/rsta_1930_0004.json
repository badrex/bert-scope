The authors discovered that cells age according to a specific equation and can maintain a reference mean for voltage within one part in a million. They also compared international measurements with the National Physical Laboratory and the Bureau of Standards, finding an average difference of zero for eight exchanges.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
