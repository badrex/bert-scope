They discovered that the heating effects from luminous sources differ from non-luminous sources and that the interceptive power of glass depends on the temperature and luminosity of the radiating source. The author also found that the heating effects on surfaces depend on the surface's color and texture, which can be used to differentiate between the types of heating influences.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
