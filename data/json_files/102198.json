The patient suffered from fluid accumulation, and Brown performed a paracenthesis to drain the excess fluid. Upon the patient's death, the liver was dissected, revealing glandular structures containing a yellowish ichor. This observation supports the opinion of Malpighius and highlights the importance of further study of the liver's glandular structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Pathology"}
