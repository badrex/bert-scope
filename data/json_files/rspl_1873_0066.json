They discovered that increasing the thickness of a gas or vapour causes its absorption to approach a continuous spectrum. The author found that metallic elements of low specific gravity approach the continuous spectrum by widening their lines, while those of high specific gravity approach the continuous state by increasing the number of their lines. This research sheds light on the relationship between atomic and subatomic matter and their spectral properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
