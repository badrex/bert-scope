It explores the behavior of insulators in polluted environments, the importance of mechanical ratings, and the development of artificial pollution tests to evaluate their performance. The article also highlights the need for further research on ultra-high voltage systems and the potential use of resin-bonded fiber-glass rods as alternatives to conventional glass and porcelain insulators."}
