They describe the structure of coelenterates, including the ectoderm, endoderm, and mesogloea, and explain how these components contribute to the animals' movements and responses. The study highlights the simplicity and efficiency of the sea anemone's nervous system, which relies on a single sheet of sensory, nervous, and muscular systems. This research provides insights into the basic principles of neurobiology and behavior in simple organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
