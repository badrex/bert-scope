The authors report detailed measurements on the electrical resistance of graphite nitrates for temperatures crossing the thermal transformation point. They discuss mechanisms of charge transport perpendicular to the layers in relation to their findings for graphite nitrates, suggesting that extrinsic conduction paths contribute significantly to the total-axis conductivity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
