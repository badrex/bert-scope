It discusses how NGF contributes to the production of persistent pain by altering the phenotype of primary sensory neurons during inflammation. The study also highlights the importance of NGF in peripheral sensitization of high-threshold thermoreceptors and its potential role in peripheral pain mechanisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
