Joule demonstrated the correctness of Professor Thomson's formula for the thermal effects of compressing fluids. He showed that the thermal effect (0) is equal to the product of temperature (T), expansibility by heat (e), pressure (p), mechanical equivalent of the thermal unit (J), and capacity for heat (K): 0 = JTe.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
