They discuss two separate mechanisms for upstream influence in supersonic flow and explain how they also operate in subsonic flow. A quantitative theory of subsonic flow up a step is provided to illustrate these differences. The main differences between subsonic and supersonic flows are the boundaries of dead-air regions, separation, and the distance of upstream influence.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
