They analyzed the gaseous and solid products of fired gunpowder under various conditions, including pressure and density. Their research aimed to understand the chemical reactions and the composition of gunpowder, which could help improve the efficiency and safety of explosives used in guns and mines. The authors found that the composition of the solid products varied significantly, and they challenged the existing theories on the products of gunpowder combustion.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Reactions and Equations"}
