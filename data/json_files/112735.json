He highlights the contributions of various researchers, such as Navier, Clapeyron, Bertot, Bresse, and Belanger, and presents a new method to treat complex cases involving varying loads and sections. The new method is applied to the Britannia bridge, demonstrating its effectiveness in calculating stresses.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Civil Engineering"}
