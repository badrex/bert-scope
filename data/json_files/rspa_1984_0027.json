The Peierls stress, which is the resistance to the motion of a dislocation, is found to have a strong dependence on the shear components of the applied stress. The Peierls stress can vary from zero to the theoretical shear strength of the lattice, depending on the nature of the critical applied stress components. The findings can lead to different orientation dependences of the flow stress in different materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Crystallography"}
