They used the whole-cell variant of the patch-clamp technique to study the force-generating mechanism in these cells, finding that it is distributed throughout the cell and closely associated with the plasma membrane. The mechanism may consist of two elements in parallel: a force-generating element and a passive elastic element.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Auditory System"}
