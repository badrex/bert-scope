The authors calculate all one-loop divergences for charged scalar and vector mesons interacting with each other and the quantized gravitational field. They show that these divergences do not cancel among themselves on or off-mass-shell, concluding that unified models of this nature have been unsuccessful in solving the problem of non-renormalizability of the gravitational field.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Gravity"}
