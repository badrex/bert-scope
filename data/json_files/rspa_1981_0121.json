The authors focus on systems where dispersion relation for the harmonic wavetrain is purely real and complex conjugate roots appear when a control parameter is varied. They discuss the differences between dissipative and dispersive instabilities and provide general results for this type of instability and their applications to various examples.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Mechanics"}
