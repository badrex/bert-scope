They observe that primary vortices generate secondary vortices through direct transference of water and friction, and that these vortices occur at free nodes of stationary waves. The authors also investigate the influence of different water depths and shapes of tanks on the vortices' behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
