The researchers found that the alveolar carbon dioxide pressure and the percentage of hemoglobin in the blood decrease with increasing altitude. These findings contribute to understanding how humans adapt to high altitudes and inform strategies for preventing altitude-related health issues.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Human Physiology"}
