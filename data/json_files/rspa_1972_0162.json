They used two methods, the jump method and a dynamic method, to determine the forces and found a gradual transition between non-retarded and retarded forces as the separation increased. The study also explored the influence of adsorbed fatty acid monolayers on the van der Waals interaction between mica surfaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
