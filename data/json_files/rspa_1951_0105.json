They propose order/length relationships to correlate theoretical calculations with experimental measurements of interatomic distances. The study covers C-N and C-S bonds, and the authors suggest that environmental factors have a small impact on these bonds. They also examine the use of molecular orbital theory in understanding bonding in heteroatomic molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Orbital Theory"}
