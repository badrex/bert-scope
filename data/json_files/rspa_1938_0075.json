Their findings support Weizsacker's hypothesis, suggesting that a precise statement of the hypothesis should be the basis of their discussion. The authors also discuss the first excited states of heavy nuclei and the changes in nuclear spin quantum numbers required by existing data regarding these transformations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
