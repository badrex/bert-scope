The authors establish a connection between the existence of the inequality and the Titchmarsh-Weyl function, showing that the best constant in the inequality is determined by the behavior of the function. The article provides a criterion for the validity of the inequality and examines various examples, giving estimates for the best constant and discussing cases of equality.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Differential Equations"}
