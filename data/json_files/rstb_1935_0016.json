The research focuses on the general morphology of the reproductive organs, the reproductive cycle, and the histological changes in the male and female reproductive organs. The findings provide insights into the breeding season, fertility, pregnancy, litter size, and lactation in stoats, contributing to the understanding of the reproductive biology of this species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Mammalogy"}
