They develop an approximate method to calculate the distribution of the duration of runs of single openings, which can be used to determine the number of channels present in a record containing only single openings. This method requires no knowledge of the ion-channel mechanism or its rate constants, making it applicable to various scenarios.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
