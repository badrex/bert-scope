He explains how the vocal cords vibrate and change with different tones and pitches. The larynx acts like a valve and a reed, and the epiglottis and pharynx play a role in the pitch of the voice. The author also discusses the controversy over whether the vocal organs are like a stringed instrument or a reeded pipe and concludes that they can perform the functions of both.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
