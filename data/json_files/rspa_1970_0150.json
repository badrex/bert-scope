The generalized model exhibits desirable properties such as duality, crossing symmetry, and Regge asymptotic behavior, and is consistent with the bootstrap hypothesis. The article also explores the implications of the model for particle physics and the construction of higher-point functions involving spinning particles.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
