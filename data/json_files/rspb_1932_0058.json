They found that the virus could survive and increase in a medium containing rabbit kidney extract, even after being treated with hypertonic saline and frozen and thawed. This study contributes to the understanding of virus growth requirements and challenges previous criticisms of cell-free virus cultivation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Virology"}
