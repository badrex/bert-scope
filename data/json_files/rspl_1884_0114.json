The results demonstrated that the corrosive action of tidal streams is more extensive than the action of sea water alone, and can cause significant damage to vessels and metallic structures. This research has implications for understanding the metallurgical aspects of tidal streams and the design of structures in coastal areas.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Corrosion and Materials Science"}
