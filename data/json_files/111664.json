The authors found that the condensation of ozone is much greater than previously thought, leading to the conclusion that ozone's density is more similar to a solid or liquid than a gas. The paper also discusses the effects of electrical discharge on other gases, such as hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbonic oxide.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
