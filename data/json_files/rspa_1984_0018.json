They found that these defects often occur in association with each other and explained their structure and precipitation mechanism using linear cation interstitial defect models. The cooling history plays a crucial role in determining the microstructures observed at room temperature in non-stoichiometric chemical systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Crystallography"}
