It explores the possibility that comets originated from satellite nebulae or nearby fragments of the same parent interstellar cloud. The author also presents a scheme for the formation of cometesimals, which is consistent with current knowledge of the contraction of a rotating magnetized fragment of an interstellar cloud.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Solar System Formation"}
