The mission focuses on studying solar flares, their origins, and related phenomena. The satellite's scientific instruments include a Fourier synthesis hard X-ray telescope, a high-sensitivity soft X-ray telescope, and a wide-band spectrometer, which will provide valuable data for understanding the mechanisms behind solar flares and their impact on the Sun's magnetic field.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
