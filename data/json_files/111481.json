The author, William Thomson, uses his brother's theory and his own experiments to show how pressure causes ice to melt and refreeze in specific patterns, leading to the formation of layers perpendicular to the direction of pressure. This process is essential in understanding the formation of glaciers and their unique structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Glaciology"}
