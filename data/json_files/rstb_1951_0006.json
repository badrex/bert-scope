They reinterpret previously described specimens and provide evidence that Leptostrobus is a reproductive organ of Czekanowskia. This challenges the classification of Czekanowskia in the Ginkgoales family, as Leptostrobus has a different fructification structure than Ginkgo.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleobotany"}
