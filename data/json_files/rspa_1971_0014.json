The author discusses the propagation of very low-frequency radio waves in these ducts and explores the properties of waveguide modes in an idealized model. The findings can be applied to better understand the guiding mechanism of whistlers in the magnetosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
