The authors found that the mantle sources of alkaline rocks had distinct trace element compositions, suggesting that these rocks originated from different mantle sources. This study provides insights into the complex processes of magma genesis and the evolution of the Earth's mantle.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geochemistry"}
