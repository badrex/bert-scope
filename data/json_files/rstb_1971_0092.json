They found that high rates of acid secretion are associated with cytochrome reduction, and that changes in chloride secretion result in opposite cytochrome redox changes. The results suggest a close coupling between the respiratory chain components and hydrogen ion secretion, which may involve changes in intracellular pH rather than changes in high energy phosphate compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology and Physiology"}
