Despite various treatments, these sailors suffered from short, asthmatic coughs, difficulty breathing, and constant anxiety. Upon autopsy, large polypi were found in the sailors' hearts, attached to the heart's columns and ventricles. This discovery adds to the historical understanding of polypi in the heart and the effects of climate and lifestyle on sailors' health.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Cardiology"}
