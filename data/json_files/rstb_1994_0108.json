Expression of a bcl-2 transgene in B lymphoid cells disrupted homeostasis and led to autoimmune diseases, while T lymphoid cells showed resistance to cytotoxic agents. The bcl-2 gene promotes cell survival and has implications for understanding lymphomagenesis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
