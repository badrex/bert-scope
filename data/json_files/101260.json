He demonstrated the effectiveness of these lenses in telescopes and reading glasses, which provided clearer and more accurate images. Smethwick also showcased burning-glasses that could warm objects at a distance and even ignite materials. The Royal Society encouraged him to continue refining his invention and share his techniques with others.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
