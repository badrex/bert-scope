F. Talbot describes his experiments with polarizing microscopes and the optical phenomena he observed in crystals. He discovered that certain crystals, when viewed under polarizing microscopes, exhibited a beautiful cross-like pattern when the polarizers were crossed. Talbot also discussed the similarities between these crystals and other optical phenomena, such as the structures found in fish lenses and glass spheres, suggesting that these structures may be due to the presence of particles with similar properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
