They analyze various patterns and compare them with the predictions of reaction-diffusion models, finding a good agreement in some cases. The study suggests that reaction-diffusion mechanisms may be involved in specifying cell wall ingrowths and cell wall outgrowths, as well as the plane of cell division.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Morphogenesis and Development"}
