The symbiotic success of the plants with the normal endophyte and M. cordifolia endophyte was observed, while the plants inoculated with the M. gale endophyte formed numerous small, ineffective nodules that did not fix nitrogen. The study provides insights into the structure and cytology of effective and ineffective nodules, contributing to our understanding of non-legume nodule-forming plants and their symbiotic relationships.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
