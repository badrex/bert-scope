The author calculates the attraction and the figure of the Earth, considering a fluid with varying density and a centrifugal force caused by rotation. The study provides equations for the surface of equilibrium and extends Clairaut's theorem to this scenario.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Geophysics"}
