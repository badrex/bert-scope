By flattening the fine silver wires, he overcame the limitations of drawing wires thin enough for precise measurements. This innovation allowed for better visibility and accuracy in telescopic observations. The flattened wires could be easily fitted into the telescope and provided a striking diminution of the visible subtense when compared to round wires.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Precision Engineering"}
