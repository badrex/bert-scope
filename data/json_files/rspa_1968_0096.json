They found that the presence of nitrous oxide increases the yields of nitrogen and that the reaction mechanism is influenced by the concentration of bromide ions. The results show that the primary radical yields are independent of pH above pH 4.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Radiation Chemistry"}
