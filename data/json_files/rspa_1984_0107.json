It explores the initial composition in terms of the Hot Big Bang cosmological theory and the different types of nuclear reactions believed to have occurred in stars, modifying the initial composition. The article also examines the interpretation of present observations in terms of the initial chemical composition and galactic and stellar formation and evolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Cosmology"}
