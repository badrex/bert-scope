The researchers found that nutrient enrichment led to increased areal pigmentation and absorption of light in the coral colonies. However, this also resulted in reduced photosynthetic efficiencies in the treated colonies. The findings have implications for understanding the ecological meaning of photosynthetic efficiencies in the aquatic environment and the role of symbiotic zooxanthellae in coral reefs.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
