They found that these compounds exhibited antiseptic activity and trypanocidal action when specific groups were present in their structures. Styryl compounds were more potent and effective in action than anil compounds. The study aimed to compare the antiseptic and trypanocidal actions of these compounds with anil quinoline compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
