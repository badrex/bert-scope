They interpret the units as mutually rectangular unit vectors in four-dimensional space and demonstrate how this algebra can represent Maxwell's equations in the Hertz-Heaviside form. This work connects the theory of relativity with electromagnetic relations and provides a mathematical framework for further exploration."}
