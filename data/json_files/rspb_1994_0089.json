They propose a hypothesis that females seek extra-pair copulations as insurance against the functional infertility of their mates, and that functional fertility is linked to male phenotype. This alternative explanation for the observed associations between male phenotype and success in obtaining extra-pair copulations does not require the operation of any mechanism to maintain genetic variation for fitness and might be considered more parsimonious than hypotheses about genetic benefits.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Behavior"}
