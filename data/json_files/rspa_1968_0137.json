They used electron and optical microscopy to estimate the density of point defects and dislocations in naturally occurring single crystals of molybdenite. The gold-decoration technique was employed to reveal surface defects and dislocations, providing insights into the topographical properties of the material. The study found that the density of defects at the surface is roughly equal to that in the bulk, and the techniques used can be applied to the study of defects in other layer structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
