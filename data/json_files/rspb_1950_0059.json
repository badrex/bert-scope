They argue that statistics can help identify key features and relationships between measurements, but cannot fully explain the underlying genetic and biochemical mechanisms. Instead, they suggest that an experimental approach, combined with other biological sciences, is necessary to understand how growth is controlled and how it leads to specific forms. They also emphasize the importance of preserving original data for future research.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Developmental Biology"}
