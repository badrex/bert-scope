They investigated the kinetics of acrylonitrile and methacrylic acid photosensitized by cerous ions and found that hydrogen ions are necessary for the polymerization reaction to proceed. The results support electron transfer processes involving monomer and cerous ions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
