The authors present evidence that water-soluble sterols have a structural specificity and may play a significant role in plant metabolism. They also highlight the need to include water-soluble sterols in future studies to better understand the role of sterols in plants.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
