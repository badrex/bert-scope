They discovered that the left gland secretes a polyphenol oxidase and the 4-O-\u03b2-glucoside of protocatechuic acid, while the right gland secretes a \u03b2-glucosidase. When mixed, the secretions interact, and the \u03b2-glucosidase liberates protocatechuic acid from its \u03b2-glucoside. The resulting acid is then oxidized in the presence of the oxidase to a quinone, which forms cross-linkages between adjacent molecules of the structural protein, creating sclerotin. This research provides a new understanding of the sclerotization process in insect oothecae.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Insect Biology"}
