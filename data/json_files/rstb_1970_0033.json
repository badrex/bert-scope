They reconstructed the topographical relationships of neural components, including the lamina, medulla, and lobula complex, and compared the neural architecture of two closely related Diptera species. Their findings provide insights into the organization of the insect visual system and the potential for further anatomical and behavioral studies.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
