Blue-green algae were the most abundant group, with other algae, lichens, and bryophytes playing a negligible role. The study highlights the variety of algal habitats and the importance of factors such as water levels, soil depth, and surrounding vegetation on the distribution of algae. The author suggests that deficiency of combined nitrogen is a major factor during early successional stages on bare coral, and that decay of blue-green algae contributes to the formation of humus over bare rock.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
