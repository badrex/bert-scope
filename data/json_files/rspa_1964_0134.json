They develop a model for the damage and use the dynamical theory of electron diffraction to analyze the contrast profiles of tracks in different positions and thicknesses of crystals. The findings help explain anomalous images and oscillatory contrast effects, providing insights into the direction of particle travel and the pattern of damage in tracks.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
