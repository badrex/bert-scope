The new formulation is based on a comprehensive action principle that determines both the field equations and the equations of motion of charged particles. The author also discusses the Hamiltonian formulation and its constraints, as well as the challenges that arise when attempting to apply quantum theory to this theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electrodynamics"}
