Davy investigates the causes and properties of fire-damp, an explosive gas found in coal mines. He analyzes the gas and discovers that it is primarily composed of hydrogen and carbon. Davy also experiments with different mixtures of fire-damp and air, finding that adding nitrogen or carbon dioxide can prevent explosions. He develops a lamp design that uses a limited amount of air to produce nitrogen and carbon dioxide, preventing the explosion of fire-damp in mines.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Mining and Mineral Resources"}
