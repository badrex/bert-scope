High-quality individuals produce larger, symmetrical ornaments, while low-quality individuals produce smaller, asymmetrical ones. This is because the cost of asymmetry increases with the size of the ornament and the length of the tail, making it difficult for low-quality individuals to develop large traits. Receivers can still obtain information on individual quality from the degree of asymmetry, but only if trait size is also assessed.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
