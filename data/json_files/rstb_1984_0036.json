The authors propose that the organic matrix serves as a template for crystal formation through epitaxial growth, with the matrix's acidic proteins and polysaccharides playing a crucial role in the process. The findings have implications for understanding biomineralization in other mineralized tissues.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biomineralization"}
