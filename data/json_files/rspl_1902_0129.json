The alga plays a role in the \"purification\" of sewage and its nitrogenous metabolism was investigated. The alga grows well in pure cultures and can be used to study its impact on the composition of polluted water.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Environmental and Earth Sciences"}
