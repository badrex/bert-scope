They classify these polyhedra by their symmetry groups, which are subgroups of the icosahedral, cubic, or dihedral groups. The author discusses the generation and elimination of prism symmetry and provides a detailed explanation of icosahedral and cubic symmetries. The study results in a comprehensive catalog of uniform polyhedra, which is essential for understanding mathematical structures and geometric shapes.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Geometry"}
