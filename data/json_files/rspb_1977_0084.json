The results show that 2-azido-ADP is more potent in causing aggregation than ADP, while 2-azidoadenosine and 2-azido-AMP inhibit platelet aggregation effectively. The study suggests that these analogues can be used as potential affinity labels for the receptors involved in platelet activation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology and Molecular Biology"}
