It discusses the effects of nonlinear properties in solid materials and the dispersion in guiding systems, which enable the realization of various nonlinear wave processes. The article classifies these processes into weak dispersion, special dispersion, strong dispersion, and active media, and highlights the specific characteristics and applications of each type.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
