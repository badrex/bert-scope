The authors use quantum formulae to calculate the second virial and viscosity coefficients and analyze the results. They discuss the helium potential and its impact on low-temperature phenomena, finding that the attractive part of the potential plays a significant role. The study helps to determine the constants needed for understanding the helium-helium interaction.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
