The authors found that increasing temperature affects the two-dimensional equilibrium pressure and that the stability of unimolecular films depends on the temperature and pressure. The findings provide insights into the stability of unimolecular films in general.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
