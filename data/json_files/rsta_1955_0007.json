They measured the magnetic torque on single crystals of these metals and found that the oscillations in the torque were related to the electronic structure of the materials. This research helped to understand the behavior of metals under high magnetic fields and contributed to the development of materials with unique properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Magnetism"}
