He discovered that the colors of fibers and mixed plates are caused by the interference of light, and that the intensity of the colors depends on the difference in the routes of the light. This work contributed to the understanding of the undulatory theory of light and the explanation of various optical phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
