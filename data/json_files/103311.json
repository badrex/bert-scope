This method is advantageous because it is less ambiguous than other methods like eclipses of the Moon and Jupiter's satellites. The author provides a star catalog with the positions of the Hyades, which can be used to instruct observers when and where to look for these stars during the Moon's appulses.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Celestial Navigation"}
