The new species is a Cinchona, but not the Cinchona officinalis of Linnaeus. It has an emetic quality, a different bark texture, and a bitter taste resembling Gentian. The tree grows in a specific environment and has medicinal properties, making it a valuable find for potential medical uses.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Botany"}
