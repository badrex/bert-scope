The author discusses various types of solutions and their limitations, emphasizing the need for a new type of analysis for thick plates. The study focuses on stress analysis and the use of cylindrical coordinates to understand the behavior of these plates under pressure.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanics of Materials"}
