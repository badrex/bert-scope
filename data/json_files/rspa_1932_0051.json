They discovered that magnetostriction is closely connected to crystal orientation and is influenced by factors such as temperature, strain, and chemical impurities. The study also found a possible relation between magnetostriction and changes in resistance in certain metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
