Presentations cover topics such as enzyme catalysis, control mechanisms, and the use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to study enzyme-substrate complexes and reaction rates in vivo. The article highlights the importance of understanding enzyme behavior in both isolated and living systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
