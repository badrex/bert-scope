Hupehsuchus represents a previously unrecognized diapsid order, the Hupehsuchia, and exhibits unique skeletal features, such as long, toothless jaws, bipartite neural spines, and a complex dermal armor pattern. The difficulty in establishing relationships between aquatic reptiles and terrestrial ancestors may be due to incomplete knowledge of the fossil record and convergence of derived characters.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology > Paleontology"}
