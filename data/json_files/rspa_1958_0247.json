The author finds that under certain conditions, an accelerated flame can develop a shock wave ahead of it, leading to detonation. The study also examines the energy released during the chemical reaction and the behavior of gas velocities and pressures in the presence of accelerated flames.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Gas Dynamics and Combustion"}
