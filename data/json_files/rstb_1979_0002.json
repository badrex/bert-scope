The authors describe their experimental setup and findings, discussing the importance of minimizing thermal radiation and heat conduction to accurately observe the transfer effect. Their experiments aimed to reproduce the phenomenon observed by Kammerlingh Onnes under slightly different conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Cryogenics"}
