They found that at high viscosities, chain termination reactions are influenced by the rate of translational diffusion of polymer radicals. The polymerization rate's dependence on viscosity is less than predicted by a simple kinetic scheme. The authors propose that only radicals above a certain size have their chain termination reactions controlled by solution viscosity, and this limiting size decreases as viscosity increases.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Science"}
