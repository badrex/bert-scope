The results show a strong correlation between secondary electron discontinuities and soft X-ray inflections, suggesting that both phenomena are influenced by the same factors. The study provides insights into the behavior of electrons and their interaction with atoms in a crystal lattice, which could help improve our understanding of material properties and electronic devices.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Material Science"}
