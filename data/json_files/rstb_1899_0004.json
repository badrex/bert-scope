They discovered that there are two distinct contractions occurring in response to increasing temperature. The first contraction is the one previously studied by other researchers, while the second contraction is less understood and requires further investigation. The authors also discuss the differences between heat-rigor and rigor-mortis and their effects on muscle excitability.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
