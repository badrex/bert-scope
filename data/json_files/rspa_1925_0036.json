The authors used a katharometer to analyze the changes in composition of the gas mixtures, focusing on five different pairs of gases. They found that the heavier molecules tend to move towards the cold side of the apparatus, and the results provide insights into the influence of different types of molecules on the amount of separation produced.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Thermodynamics"}
