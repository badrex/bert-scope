The model suggests that simple movement rules for wolves and basic predation dynamics can explain the observed patterns in the field, such as the segregation of high deer and wolf densities. The predator-prey interaction may play a significant role in maintaining territories.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology"}
