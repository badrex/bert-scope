They found that nitrosylsulphuric acid has unique spectral features, indicating the presence of specific groups within the molecule. The study also revealed similarities and differences in the spectra of the three acids, providing insights into their molecular configurations.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
