The proposed function is simple and suitable for mathematical analysis while providing an adequate representation of the mechanical response of rubberlike materials. The theory is tested against experimental data from simple tension, pure shear, and equibiaxial tension tests, demonstrating excellent agreement. The findings have implications for the constitutive inequality proposed by Hill.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
