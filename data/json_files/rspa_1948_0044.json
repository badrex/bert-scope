The theory assumes the fluid is incompressible and visco-inelastic, and it applies to steady-state laminar flow. Two problems involving the torsional motion of a fluid are discussed, and the resulting stress distribution and force systems are derived.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
