He describes the planet's shape as flattened at the poles and slightly flattened at the equator, with the equatorial regions appearing more curved than the polar regions. He also examines the changes in Saturn's appearance due to its different aspects and the influence of its ring on its figure.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Planetary Science"}
