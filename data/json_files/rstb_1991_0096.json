Their eyes have three distinct regions, with various adaptations that allow different portions of the eye to perform different visual tasks. Mantis shrimps have the potential to analyze polarized light in a detailed manner, which may help them navigate and locate prey in their environment.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
