The authors found that the fracture toughness of these polymers is highly dependent on the strain rate and temperature. They propose a thermal diffusion-controlled process as the most likely cause of the observed rate dependence, which leads to crack-tip blunting and increased fracture toughness.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
