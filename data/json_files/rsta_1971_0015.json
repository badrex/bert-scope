The authors report radiometric dates on the rocks and discuss the geological history and structure of the area. The study raises certain petrological problems, particularly the physical conditions under which the amphibolites were metamorphosed. The article also describes the chemical analyses of rocks and electron probe analyses of minerals found in the area.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
