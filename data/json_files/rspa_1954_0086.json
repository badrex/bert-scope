They resolved the rotational fine structure of six bands, including two associated with isotopic species, and performed a rotational analysis. The results were compared with the values obtained from the microwave spectrum for the lower states, and the effects of Fermi resonance and Coriolis interaction were considered.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
