They found that good creep rupture ductility and strength of the weld material are necessary for long vessel lifetimes. The study led to the development of a methodology for weldment design using supercomputer-based analysis techniques, which is quick, accurate, and a viable design tool.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Welding Engineering"}
