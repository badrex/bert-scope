The researchers found that track-density gradients in mineral grains from different depths indicate that most of the material has been cycled through the top millimeter of the surface at some point in history. The data suggest two possible models for the regolith's deposition and irradiation history, with implications for future lunar missions and sample storage.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Lunar Geology"}
