They found that large amounts of oestrin cause the development of the uterus and mammary glands, but do not induce the changes typical of the luteal phase. The results suggest that oestrin is not antagonistic to the action of the luteal hormones.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
