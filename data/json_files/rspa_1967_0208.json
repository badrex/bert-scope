They used various probes to investigate the expansion process and the properties of the molecular beam produced by the expansion. The study aimed to analyze the composition of high-temperature gas as a function of time using a mass spectrometer, providing insights into the mechanisms responsible for the formation of various ionic species.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
