They extend Lord Rayleigh's method to coated cylinders and analyze the behavior of the effective dielectric constant in terms of the dielectric constants of the three phases and cylinder radii. This research has implications for understanding the transport properties of various materials, including thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity, and magnetic permeability.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
