Daniel Paret, conducted experiments to prove that water is a simple element that can be transformed into oxygen and hydrogen through a gaseous process using electricity. He argued that this transformation is not a decomposition of pre-existing elements but a gaseous transformation of water's combined electricity into two \"sub-elements.\" This discovery challenges the existing theory of a compound electric fluid and reveals a previously unknown power in water.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
