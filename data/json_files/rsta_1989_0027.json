Radar studies of ionospheric flows reveal a two-cell pattern with westward and eastward flows in the pre- and post-midnight sectors. The flow pattern is sensitive to the solar wind and the direction of the interplanetary magnetic field, providing valuable information about the coupling of the solar wind, magnetosphere, and ionosphere. The Sweden and Britain Radar-auroral Experiment (SABRE) is used to measure these flows and their interactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Space Physics"}
