The availability of trace elements in soils depends on their geological origin and subsequent history. The weathering of rocks by pedological and biological processes leads to the formation of different soil types, which affect the availability of trace elements to plants. The author highlights the importance of understanding soil properties and management practices to ensure a sufficient supply of bioessential trace elements for plant growth and to prevent potential toxicity issues.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Soil Science"}
