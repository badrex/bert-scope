The animal has a soft, membranous body, covered in hair and sharp, black prickles. It has numerous legs and fins, allowing it to move through the water. The creature's internal anatomy includes a stomach, intestine, and anus, but no brain, heart, or gills. Molyneux suggests that this creature belongs to the Scolopendra Marinae family due to its shared characteristics.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
