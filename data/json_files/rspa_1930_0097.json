They discovered two types of photoelectrons, primary and secondary cathode ray groups, which have different energy sources and behaviors. This research helps improve the understanding of atomic physics and the behavior of X-ray electrons.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
