The authors analyze the mechanisms of crystallization, including nucleation and growth processes, and propose a helical ribbon structure for radiating fibrils in spherulites. The study provides insights into the relationship between molecular arrangement and physical properties of crystallized polymers.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Science"}
