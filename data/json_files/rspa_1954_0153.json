Contrary to existing theories, no significant effect of particle size was found in the low-temperature range. However, a noticeable particle-size effect was observed at higher temperatures, which may be attributed to changes in the optical modes of vibration of the solid. The complex crystal structure of titanium dioxide prevents any quantitative theoretical calculations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
