They confirm that gamma-rays are emitted after the disintegration of thorium C, supporting Gamow's hypothesis that the thorium C nucleus can be initially formed with alpha-particles in the ground state and sometimes disintegrate, leaving the product nucleus excited.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
