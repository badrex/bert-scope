The researchers observe changes in optical textures and discuss the role of local anisotropy, molecular correlation coefficient, and defect structure in the material's response to shear. They also present a numerical scheme that predicts the observed behavior of TLCPS under shear.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Polymer Science"}
