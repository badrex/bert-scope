He discovered that birds have unique structures in their heads that allow them to hear sounds quickly and accurately, even without a cochlea. These structures help birds distinguish and imitate sounds effectively. Moulen also examined the nerves, bones, and other features in bird heads, providing insights into their sensory capabilities and overall physiology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Physiology"}
