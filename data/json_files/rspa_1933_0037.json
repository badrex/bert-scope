The absorption spectrum is found to be of the predissociation type, similar to ammonia. The quantum yield of the decomposition process is determined, and the effect of temperature and pressure on the reaction is studied. The results provide insights into the mechanism of the reactions and contribute to the understanding of phosphine's photochemical properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Photochemistry"}
