The author raises concerns about the accuracy of recent measurements by F. A. Williams and suggests that his findings may be less reliable than previous studies. The author also proposes improvements to experimental methods to increase accuracy and reliability of future measurements.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Gas dynamics"}
