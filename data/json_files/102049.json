Smith, presents a conjecture about an under-current at the Strait's mouth, affecting tides and water flow in the Mediterranean Sea. He observes that a strong under-current may be responsible for the lack of noticeable water level changes along the Barbary Coast. Smith also shares an instance of a similar under-current in the Baltic Sound, suggesting further experiments to confirm or disprove his conjecture.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
