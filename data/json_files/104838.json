He discusses various theories about their origin and refutes the idea that they are teeth or horns of fish, shells, or spines of echini. Da Costa argues that belemnites are a distinct type of marine fossil and that all belemnites share the same origin.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Paleontology"}
