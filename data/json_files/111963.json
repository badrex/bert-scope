Griess and C. A. Martins, re-examined Zeise's ethylene-dichloride of platinum compounds and analyzed new double compounds in the series. They found that the original formulae given by Zeise are correct and that the existence of the group (C2H)2O assumed by Liebig in these substances is not supported by experimental evidence. They also combined ethylene-dichloride of platinum with mono- and diatomic bases and chlorides of the bases, and observed new reactions and compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
