This challenges the idea that streptococci can be differentiated into fixed and independent types based on these tests. The author's findings are supported by other researchers, highlighting the need for further investigation into the stability of these tests for bacterial classification.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
