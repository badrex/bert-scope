They introduce stochastic dynamics to modify the conventional Schrodinger evolution and use stochastic differential geometry to provide a systematic geometric formulation for stochastic models of state vector collapse. The study involves the use of modern probabilistic methods, such as martingales and their associated quadratic variation processes, to analyze the reduction phenomenon.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Differential Geometry"}
