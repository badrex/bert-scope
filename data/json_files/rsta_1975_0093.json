It reviews the basis of the theory, the radio and hydromagnetic approximations, and the properties of the magnetoplasma, including the Alfven velocity. The article also covers the two-fluid magnetoplasma, the dielectric tensor, and the conductivity tensor.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
