By removing already-mated males and allowing females to remate with new males, researchers evaluated the parentage of the original males using DNA fingerprinting. The results showed that the original males fathered only two out of 46 eggs in the subsequent clutches, indicating a high success rate of replacement males. This suggests that extra-pair copulations more than 2 days before egg-laying have a low success rate.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Evolution"}
