They find that the apparent deflection due to tilting is counteracted by the attraction of water, and that the influence of gravity on deformation has been ignored in previous calculations. The study provides insights into the complex interactions between tides, Earth's elasticity, and gravity.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
