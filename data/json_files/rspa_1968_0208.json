The model represents the liquid as an anisotropic solid and the flame as a moving strip source of heat. The authors derive expressions for the rate of flame spread and temperature variations in the liquid, and compare the model's predictions with experimental data to determine values of effective thermal conductivities and heat flux from the flame to the liquid.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Heat Transfer"}
