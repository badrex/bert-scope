At lower temperatures, a magnetic field applied along a specific direction causes a phase transition from a metallic, non-magnetic state to a semimetallic, magnetic state. This orbitally induced transition is unique and leads to steps in the Hall resistance, suggesting the quantum Hall effect. The article discusses the experimental situation and possible origins of these magnetotransport phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
