They found that the absorption bands of these molecules occur at wavelengths shorter than 2000 \u00c5 and observed several Rydberg series converging to specific ionization potentials. The results provide insights into the electronic structures and resonance effects of these molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
