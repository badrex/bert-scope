They found that the stilbene molecule has a planar structure with a carbon-carbon double bond distance of about 1.34 \u00c5 and a single bond distance of about 1.54 \u00c5. The authors also discovered that there is resonance between two forms of the stilbene molecule, contributing to its structure and properties. This research provides a better understanding of the molecular structure and properties of stilbene and related compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
