It shows that NAD significantly decreases larval development time by modifying the NAD pool, altering electron transport chain activity, and ATP, ADP, and AMP levels. This suggests a link between energy metabolism and gene expression.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
