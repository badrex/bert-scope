He believed these bones belonged to an elephant, as they were much larger than the bones of any current creatures in the island. Luffkin also mentioned the possibility of Roman armies passing through the area and burying an elephant, as described by Camden in his Britannia. The bones could have been preserved due to the rising of valleys and the washing down of earth by rain and snow.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Archaeology"}
