The research found that chemostat continuous-flow cultures yielded higher efficiencies of converting amino acids to cell material. The highest efficiency was achieved when glutamic acid replaced glutamine in the medium. The results suggest that the cell growth rate significantly affects amino acid uptake rates and metabolism, with a specific growth rate of 43 hours (cell doubling time) marking a notable change in amino acid metabolism."}
