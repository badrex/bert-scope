The authors found that these compounds primarily affect the spinal cord and brain, causing symptoms similar to certain diseases of the spinal cord in humans. They also observed differences in the actions of various members of the benzene group, which they attribute to differences in their chemical structure. The research was conducted using rats and frogs, with experiments performed on their spinal cords, nerves, and muscles.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology", "sub_discipline": "Neurophysiology"}
