He also discussed the difficulty of studying these birds in their torpid state and the challenges in determining whether they are birds of passage or remain in the area during winter. His findings contribute to the understanding of bird behavior and biology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ornithology"}
