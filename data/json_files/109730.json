He inferred that these nebulae are made of material matter, which supports the idea that they are related to the formation of celestial bodies like stars and planets. He also noticed that some nebulae have a spheroidal shape, which suggests a principle of attraction and possibly a rotation on their axes.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Celestial Mechanics"}
