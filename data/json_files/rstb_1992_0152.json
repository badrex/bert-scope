Human over-exploitation has caused significant changes in the distribution and abundance of these marine top predators. The authors evaluate hypotheses that suggest population increases in krill-eating penguins and seals are a result of recovery from exploitation, accelerated by the removal of krill-eating whales. The study highlights the importance of understanding the links between physical and biological processes and their impact on marine populations in the face of future environmental change.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
