He finds that certain substances, such as bismuth, antimony, and arsenic, exhibit magnecrystallic effects, while others like copper, tin, and lead do not. Faraday also discovers that the magnecrystallic force is distinct from magnetic and diamagnetic forces, as it does not cause attraction or repulsion but instead determines a specific position for the crystal under its influence.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Magnetism"}
