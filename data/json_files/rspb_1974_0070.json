The researchers found that both homologous and heterologous proteins attach to cell components, challenging the hypothesis's main tenets. They also discovered that nuclear fractions have a higher attachment rate, suggesting a mechanism for selecting between different proteins.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
