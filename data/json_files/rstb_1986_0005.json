They propose a model linking evolutionary changes in satellite DNAs and chromosome structure, and discuss the potential impact of satellite DNA on cell proliferation and organismal growth. The study suggests that satellite DNA may have an adaptive role in the development and evolution of newts.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Evolution"}
