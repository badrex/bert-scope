They investigate the bourses calicinales, or chromatophores, which are bead-like appendages that play a role in the animals' sensory abilities. The author provides a detailed description of the chromatophore's structure and function, including its layers and components, and discusses the challenges of examining these delicate tissues. This research contributes to the understanding of the sensory capabilities of Actinia and their nervous system."}
