They found that the transformation of urea into ammonium carbonate affects the hydrogen ion concentration of the medium, which can be used to deduce the amount of urea hydrolyzed. The method is useful for analyzing urea concentrations in urine and blood of elasmobranch fishes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
