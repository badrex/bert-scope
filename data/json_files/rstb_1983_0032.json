Due to incorrect folding in the original publication, the descriptions of plates 2-10 and their corresponding explanatory drawings were misplaced. The error has been corrected in offprints and bound volumes, and subscribers with separate issues should notify their binders.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleontology"}
