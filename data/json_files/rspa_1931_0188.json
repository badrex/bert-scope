They found that the scattering showed large deviations from the classical law of scattering, which assumed that nuclei behave as point charges surrounded by a Coulomb field of force. The new mechanics, rather than classical mechanics, can explain these anomalous scattering results.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
