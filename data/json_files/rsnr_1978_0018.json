Brunel", "19th century"], "tldr": "This article explores the history of British engineering and science in the mid-19th century, focusing on the life and career of I.K. Brunel. It discusses how Brunel's unique background and connections allowed him to bridge the gap between science and engineering, and how his practical approach and theoretical competence made him a key figure in the development of British infrastructure during that time. The article also highlights the growing specialization and polarization within scientific and technological studies, which Brunel, along with other polymaths, helped shape.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences, Art, and Humanities > History of Science and Technology"}
