The study confirms previous observations that the so-called continuous spectrum of a carbon monoxide flame is actually banded, and that the presence of hydrogen in the flame causes the banded and continuous parts of the spectrum to fade away, leaving only \"steam\" lines visible. This research sheds light on the complex combustion process of carbon monoxide and the role of hydrogen in the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
