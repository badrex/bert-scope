The authors describe the transcriptional activation of stress-responsive genes, the role of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutases (SODs), catalases (CATs), and peroxidases, and the effects of overproducing these enzymes in transgenic plants. The article highlights the importance of understanding and manipulating these mechanisms to create plants better adapted to environmental stress.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
