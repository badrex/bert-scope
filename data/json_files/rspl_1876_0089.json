The author compares the results of various experiments conducted at different heights and discusses the differences in the changes of horizontal force observed. The study suggests that the influence of the medium between the upper and lower observation points plays a significant role in the magnetic variations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Geomagnetism"}
