The researchers collected, fractionated, and chemically analyzed the mucins, and used histochemistry and electron microscopy to examine the tracheal epithelium. The results show that acetylcholine increases tracheal mucin secretion, while a- and /?-stimulant sympathomimetic amines do not affect it. The study provides insights into the composition and control of tracheal mucus from goblet cells alone.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology and Anatomy"}
