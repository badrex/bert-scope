He proposes a new approach to study the brain by following the course of natural filaments in the nervous matter. Bell demonstrates that sensibility and motion belong to the cerebrum, and that two columns descend from each hemisphere, responsible for voluntary motion and sensation. He also describes the striated septa in the medulla oblongata and pons Varolii, which play a crucial role in distinguishing and separating the columns of the brain.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Brain anatomy"}
