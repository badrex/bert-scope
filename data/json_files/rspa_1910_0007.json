The authors heated iron to redness and applied strain in a vacuum to study its deformation mechanisms. They discovered that the heated iron formed irregular slip-bands, similar to those formed at room temperature, and observed changes in the crystal structure due to the iron's critical points. These findings contribute to the understanding of iron's behavior under high-temperature conditions and its applications in industries such as forging and hot-rolling.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Metallurgy"}
