They discuss the possibility of a rigid core based on the discovery of shear waves transmitted through the core, contradicting the widely accepted liquid core hypothesis. The author presents new evidence from a New Zealand earthquake, which supports the existence of a rigid core.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Seismology"}
