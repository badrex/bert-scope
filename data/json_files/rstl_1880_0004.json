They observed various phenomena of the electric arc and analyzed the potential necessary to produce a discharge between discs at constant distances and different pressures. Their findings contribute to the understanding of the forces involved in the production of complex electric discharge phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
