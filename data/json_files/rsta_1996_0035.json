The authors discover homoclinic bifurcations where a unique connecting orbit is replaced by a countable infinity of orbits (explosion) and where a countable infinity collapses to a unique orbit (implosion). They also find a rich variety of heteroclinic connections among fixed points and periodic orbits. These findings have implications for the study of travelling wave structures in the complex Ginzburg-Landau partial differential equation.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Dynamical Systems"}
