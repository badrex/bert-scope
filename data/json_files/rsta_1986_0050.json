The researchers engineered specific mutations in the DHFR enzyme to test its structure-function relations and analyzed the crystal structures of the mutant enzymes. The study reveals that aspartate-27 plays a role in substrate protonation, while its contribution to transition-state stabilization is negligible. The findings provide insights into the enzyme's catalytic mechanism and inhibitor binding.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
