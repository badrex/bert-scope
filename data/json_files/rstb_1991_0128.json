The researchers used shell features and internal morphology to clarify taxonomic divisions and discovered that these deep-sea species share several key features, such as the form of their lateral body pouches. The study also discusses the adaptation of these species to life in deep-sea environments and their wide distribution across the globe.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology > Zoology > Malacology"}
