They analyzed beryllium's atomic weight and specific heat, which did not align with the periodic law of Dmitri Mendeleev. The authors also discussed the challenges in analyzing beryllium's composition and the objections raised by other scientists. Their findings contribute to a better understanding of beryllium's place in the periodic table and its chemical properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Beryllium and Periodic Table"}
