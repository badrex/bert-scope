They apply the method to the external source problem, one- and two-meson propagators, and meson-pair theory, demonstrating its effectiveness in certain scenarios but also highlighting potential issues with renormalization and the presence of \"ghost states.\"", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Field Theory"}
