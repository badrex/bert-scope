The research uses a sphere-on-flat geometry and molecularly smooth surfaces to measure the frictional force and determine the area of the film being sheared. The findings reveal that the shear strength of these materials increases with pressure and decreases with temperature.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Tribology"}
