The model focuses on the visual planning of two-fingered grasps and uses dynamic contours for real-time visual tracking. The authors develop a theory for classifying grasps based on their stability properties and demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through practical computer algorithms.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Robotics"}
