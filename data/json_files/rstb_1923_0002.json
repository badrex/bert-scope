They identify three main groups of flatfishes based on their asymmetry and general structure, and discuss the changes in their skulls and bones during their transformation. The research provides insights into the adaptation of flatfishes to life on the sea floor and the role of natural selection in their evolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
