The authors argue that by adopting a global cosmological perspective, the issues of divergent integrals in classical and quantum electrodynamics can be resolved. They also discuss the role of the universe's response in avoiding infinities in quantum electrodynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
