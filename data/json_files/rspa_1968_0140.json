The authors apply the scattering matrix technique and Stokes's operator formalism to describe the birefringence in fluid materials. They discuss the Kerr effect, optical Kerr effect, and the effect of optically active molecules on polarization. The study provides a theoretical framework for understanding and predicting optical properties of materials under various electric field conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
