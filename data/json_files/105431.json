They found that coal consists mostly of water and that a significant amount of this component can be separated by gentle heat. Coal differs from vegetable-based wood in several aspects, such as its powder emitting heavy black smoke when burned and not easily igniting or consuming to ashes. The study provides insights into the differences between coal and other materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Mineralogy and Petrography"}
