They use fluorescence microscopy and other techniques to study the process and its implications for understanding lysosomal function and cellular processes. The findings suggest that lysosomes play a crucial role in the breakdown of complex molecules and can concentrate various substances, which may have implications for disease and cellular health.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
