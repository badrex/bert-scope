The rectal complex helps in removing water from the faeces by increasing the osmotic pressure of the fluid in the perinephric chamber, making it easier for the rectal epithelium to absorb water and nutrients from the faecal waste.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Insect Physiology"}
