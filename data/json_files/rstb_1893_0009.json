The research aimed to understand the distribution of sensory roots in the hind limbs and refine previous findings on the subject. The study employed various experimental methods, including mechanical and thermal stimuli, and contributed to the understanding of the nervous system's structure and function.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroanatomy"}
