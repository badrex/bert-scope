They demonstrate that the stress tensor expectation value is a local, geometrical object in the massless case, and its explicit form is fixed by using the known value of the conformal anomaly. The existence of a type of vacuum entropy and temperature is shown for the static models with space curvature.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Cosmology"}
