They found that mechanical treatment does not affect the electrical properties of metals, while even a small impurity significantly reduces conductivity. The author also discusses the freezing of liquefied atmospheric air into a solid state, leaving further research to determine its composition.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
