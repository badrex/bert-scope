They demonstrate the technique's application in measuring reaction rates for radical anions in various molecules, such as tetraphenylethylene, 1,1-diphenylethylene, and 1,1-diphenylacetylene. The ESR technique allows researchers to observe changes in radical ion concentrations over time, providing valuable insights into reaction mechanisms and activation energies.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
