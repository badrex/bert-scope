They found that the sawflies consistently laid their eggs on a specific type of willow plant, even when other suitable plants were available. This discovery supports the idea that acquired food habits can be inherited and passed down through generations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Evolution"}
