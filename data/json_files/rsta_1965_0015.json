The authors examine the effects of changing applied stress and Burgers vectors of the dislocations, making quantitative estimates of the yield stress and comparing them with experimental results. The study suggests that the attractive dislocation intersections mechanism may play a significant role in describing the temperature dependence of the flow stress, orientation dependence of work hardening, the Bauschinger effect, and the formation of cell walls.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Dislocation Theory"}
