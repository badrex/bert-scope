Using compound-specific isotope analysis, the researchers found that fatty acids from zooxanthellae have a different carbon isotope signature than those from the host, suggesting multiple sources for the fatty acids in the host and direct translocation of some fatty acids from the zooxanthellae to the host.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Symbiosis"}
