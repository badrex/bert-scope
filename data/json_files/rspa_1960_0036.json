The spectra show complex features, including an array of peaks and valleys, which provide insights into the behavior of three-dimensional lattices. The method is suitable for use on high-speed digital computers and can be applied to study the effect of variation in order on the vibrational spectra of different types of chains.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
