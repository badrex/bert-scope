They discovered that iron contains a sulphur-like substance that makes it bright, malleable, and easy to melt. This substance can be raised by the sun's heat, and when removed from the focus of the glass, the iron appears to be in its metallic form. The author also found that iron deprived of this substance melts into a brittle mass and can be turned back into a metal with the help of a little oil.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Metallurgy"}
