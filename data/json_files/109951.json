The study reveals similarities to shark vertebral structures and discusses the difficulty in classifying the fins as either forelimbs or fins. This research contributes to understanding the evolution of vertebrates and their adaptations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolution and Comparative Anatomy"}
