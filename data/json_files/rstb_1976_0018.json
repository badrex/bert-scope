The authors focus on the use of dicyanocob(m)yrinic acid heptamethyl ester and cob(i)yrinic acid heptamethyl ester in their experiments. They describe various chemical reactions and the electronic absorption spectra of the products. The study provides insights into the reactivity of the macrocyclic ligand and the importance of the chromophoric system in these molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
