He identifies the plants used, such as the threeleaved Hellebore and Galium Tinctorium, and experiments with their dyeing properties. Forster suggests that these natural dyes could be useful in European manufacturing and commerce, and encourages further research into indigenous knowledge and techniques.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Botany"}
