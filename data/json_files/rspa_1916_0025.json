The researchers used various instruments to collect data at Kew Observatory and Eskdalemuir. The results show a decrease in all electrical quantities after sunset and a slight increase after sunrise. The study also discusses the potential impact of these findings on wireless transmission phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
