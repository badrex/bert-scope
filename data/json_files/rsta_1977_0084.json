The authors found a link between the albedo and the presence of an iron-rich substance on the surface of the soil grains. They propose that solar wind sputtering plays a significant role in determining the surface chemical composition and optical properties of the soil. The study suggests that heavy metals, such as iron and titanium, become concentrated on the surface through a process of selective removal of lighter elements by sputtering.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Lunar Geology"}
