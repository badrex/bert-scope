The researchers found that external ATP activates a conductance that carries both cations (potassium and calcium) and anions (chloride). This ATP-activated conductance resembles a P2-mediated response in its kinetics, agonist potency, and blockade by suramin, but differs in its requirement for high concentrations of ATP and the activation of a cationic as well as anionic conductance.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
