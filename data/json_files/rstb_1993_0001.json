The researchers discovered two distinct classes of electrical activity in comb plates: excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in comb plate cells and regenerative potentials in cilia. They found that several conduction pathways are present to control electrical and motor activities during feeding. A localized pacemaker drives oscillatory neuronal activity in the ectodermal pathway innervating polster cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
