They consider the membrane as a thin, incompressible, and isotropic elastic body attached to the tooth and the socket. The study provides insights into the displacement of the tooth, strain, and stress in the membrane under applied forces, and explains the tightness of teeth using the pressure variations in the incompressible medium.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
