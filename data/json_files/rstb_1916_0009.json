The results show a parallelism between stomatal aperture and transpiration rate, with stomata playing a significant role in regulating transpiration. The author also discusses the limitations of the method and the factors affecting stomatal behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Physiology"}
