The authors provide evidence for the close structural relationship between verdohaem and biliverdin, and discuss the different reactions and by-products involved in the formation and conversion of these compounds. They also highlight the challenges in naming and categorizing these green haemoglobin preparations, and suggest that further exploration of their structure is needed for a more rational nomenclature.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
