The authors explain that cement strength is influenced by two types of pores: colloidal pores and crack-like pores. By controlling the porosity of cement products, they were able to create advanced cement-based materials with improved strength and toughness, competing with metals, plastics, and ceramics in some applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
