They prepared a selectively deuterated enzyme and found that ligands like methotrexate and NADPH affect the chemical shifts of the tyrosine residues. The results provide insights into the molecular interactions and conformational changes of the enzyme upon ligand binding.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
