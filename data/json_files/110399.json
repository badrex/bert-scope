The method involves using subsidiary observations on two stars with similar zenith distances and measuring the angular distance between them. This technique can help account for changes in the position of stars due to aberration, nutation, and other factors, and may be useful in future investigations with moveable zenith instruments.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
