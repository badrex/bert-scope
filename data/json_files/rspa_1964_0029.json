The resulting integrals are evaluated by residue theory, leading to eigenfunction expansions. Both Fourier integral methods and eigenfunction expansions are unified in a single theory, establishing the completeness of the eigenfunction expansions. The singularities of the integrands of the Fourier integrals correspond to the eigenvalue zero, resulting in polynomial solutions representing classical beam bending and stretching theories.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
