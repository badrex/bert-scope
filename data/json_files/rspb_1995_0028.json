Using guppies and blue acara cichlid fish as a model prey-predator system, the researchers demonstrated that predators were less likely to attack and kill guppies that inspected them. This suggests that predator inspection behavior in guppies has a direct fitness benefit and can deter predator pursuit.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Behavior"}
