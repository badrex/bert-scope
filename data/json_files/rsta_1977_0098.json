It describes the different stages of lunar history, from the formation of the Moon to the present day, and how various impact events and volcanic eruptions have shaped the lunar surface. The authors emphasize the importance of separating stratigraphy from genetic interpretations of morphological features on the Moon.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth and Environmental Sciences > Geology > Planetary Geology"}
