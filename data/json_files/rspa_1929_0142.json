They found that the presence of adsorbed gas significantly affects the efficiency of soft X-ray excitation and the photoelectric current. The researchers also discovered that proper degassing and surface treatment of the photoelectric detector are crucial for accurate measurements of soft X-ray emissivities and photoelectric activity of different elements.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Material Science"}
