The research shows that alkylation causes chain breakage and a decrease in molecular weight, with the rate of breakage being proportional to the extent of alkylation. The findings have implications for understanding DNA damage and the development of chemotherapy treatments.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
