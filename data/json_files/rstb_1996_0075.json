It discusses the four remarkable attributes of these species, including rapid evolution of reproductive isolation, persistence in sympatry, high degree of niche differentiation, and high intrinsic viability and fertility of hybrids. The author presents evidence for ecological speciation in these fish populations, arguing that understanding ecological environments is essential for understanding the origin of species in adaptive radiation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Evolution"}
