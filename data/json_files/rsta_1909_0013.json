The authors find that the osmotic equilibrium pressures of these solutions are influenced by their degree of ionization, with weaker solutions showing greater ionization. The study also explores the conductivities of these solutions and their connection to osmotic pressure and ionization.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
