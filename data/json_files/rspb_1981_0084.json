The authors define clines as stable non-constant solutions of a mathematical equation and provide conditions for their existence in both bounded and unbounded habitats. They also discuss the effects of variable migration and carrying capacity on the formation of clines.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Population Genetics"}
