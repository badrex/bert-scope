They found that the atomic weight of manganese is approximately 55, with some variations in results due to the methods used. The authors also discussed the challenges in obtaining accurate results and the importance of using pure materials in chemical analysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Atomic weight and Periodic Table"}
