Costard describes his sighting of a fiery meteor on July 14, 1745. The meteor appeared as a long stream of fire, resembling molten glass, and had a slow, steady motion. It changed shape several times before eventually vanishing. Costard's observation of the meteor is significant as it provides a detailed account of a celestial event from the 18th century.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
