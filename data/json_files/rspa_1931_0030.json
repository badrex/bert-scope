They found that iodine retards the gaseous reaction and inhibits the low-pressure explosion, while water vapor inhibits the explosion when present in large amounts. The experiments provide insights into the chemical processes occurring in the chains during the reaction.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
