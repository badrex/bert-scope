The authors find an inverse correlation between the Finn Cycling Index and the normalized internal ascendancy or system maturity. They also show that the production-to-biomass ratio cannot be used as an indicator of marine ecosystem evolution. The study concludes that a network representation is a suitable methodology for inter-ecosystem comparisons.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology"}
