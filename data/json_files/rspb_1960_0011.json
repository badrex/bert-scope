The results show that the three fractions are transmitted at different rates, with fraction III being transmitted nearly as readily as whole y-globulin. This suggests that fraction III, which contains most of the antigenic groups of the original molecule, may have the configuration recognized by the cells as homologous y-globulin.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
