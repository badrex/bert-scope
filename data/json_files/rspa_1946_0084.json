The authors estimate the vibration frequencies and molecular dimensions to calculate the Helmholtz free energy, Gibbs function, and entropy of the gas. They also discuss the molecular partition function and the potential energy function for the molecule. The findings provide provisional values for the thermodynamic properties of sulfur dichloride until more accurate experimental data becomes available.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Thermodynamics"}
