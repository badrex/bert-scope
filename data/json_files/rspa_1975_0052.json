They found that the actual Poisson ratio tends towards its lower limit in the direction of the shear by which the transformation proceeds, while in other directions, it tends towards its upper bound. This research provides insight into the elastic instability that occurs during the phase transition.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
