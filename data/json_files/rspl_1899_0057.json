They discover that silicium lines can be divided into three sets, each behaving differently under varying electrical conditions. The author also observes that silicium appears at different temperatures in stars, with some lines being short-lived in stellar spectra.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
