This leads to a systematic categorization of point singularities in the arrangement of optimal orientation and phase in the cortex. The analysis predicts different types of orientation centers and point singularities related to the optimal phase, which are confirmed through computer simulations based on the author's thermodynamic model for neural network self-organization.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
