They also classify the operators of a group and show that any matrix can be expressed as a linear function of the 16 matrices of a fundamental set. Furthermore, they discuss the invariance of the wave-equation under transformations and the connection between the transformation matrix and wave-operators.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Group Theory"}
