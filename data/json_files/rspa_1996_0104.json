The authors characterize the surface roughness and radar backscatter, and evaluate simple models that relate the two. They find that the Bragg model, which explains radar backscatter from small-scale surface disturbances, has some shortcomings when applied to the breaking region due to large surface height variations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
