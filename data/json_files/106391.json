The author, Thomas Barker, observed that the end of winter and beginning of spring were warmer than the previous year. The spring seed-time was very favorable, and the vines began to grow in March. The summer was hot and dry, with occasional rain, and grass was relatively scarce. The author also noted that the year was unusual for its fine weather, with many fruits ripening earlier than usual. The harvest was generally successful, with wheat and barley prices remaining low. However, the summer was not considered healthy, with an increase in illnesses such as colds, sore throats, and fevers.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Climate and Meteorology"}
