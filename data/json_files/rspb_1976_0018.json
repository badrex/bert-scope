The study found that the first retino-tectal synapses appeared on the eleventh day of incubation and that the early response characteristics of the first and second postsynaptic tectal cells were recorded. The research also discovered that the development of the retino-tectal connection in the chicken differs from that in the frog in several fundamental respects.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
