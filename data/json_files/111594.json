Brodie, conducted experiments to determine the atomic weight of graphite. He discovered a unique system of compounds in graphite, which has a distinct atomic weight of 33. This conclusion is supported by the specific heat of graphite, which is an exception to the general law that the specific heat of elemental bodies varies inversely with their atomic weight.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Atomic Theory"}
