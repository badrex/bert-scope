They discuss the challenges and potential factors affecting the results, such as the presence of nitrogen oxides. The findings have implications for understanding flame spectra and the emissive power of gaseous substances at low temperatures. The author also mentions plans for future communication on this topic.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
