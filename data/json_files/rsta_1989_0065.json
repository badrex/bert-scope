It explores various components such as fiber-fiber fused couplers, fiber sensitization techniques, optical filters, doped fibers, fiber amplifiers, second harmonic generation, and Kerr effects. These components offer advantages in terms of performance and cost, enabling the creation of complex frequency-selective systems for high-speed and high-capacity communications."}
