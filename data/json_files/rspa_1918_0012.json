They found that the atmosphere can transmit ultra-violet light up to a certain point, challenging previous assumptions about the limits of the solar spectrum. The author also discovered that the lower atmosphere's ability to transmit ultra-violet light is not limited by ozone absorption.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atmospheric Science"}
