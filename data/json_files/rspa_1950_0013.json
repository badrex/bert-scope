These transformations show that time dilation occurs when an observer moves relative to a stationary frame, and the absolute velocity of a Galilean frame, rather than the relative velocity between observers, affects the transformation equations. The author also demonstrates that these modified Lorentz transformations are more general than the original ones, as they include Einstein's relative-velocity formulae."}
