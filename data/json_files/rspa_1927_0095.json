The authors explain how the maximum explosion pressure occurs when the ratio of carbon monoxide to air is greater than 2, and they provide experimental results to support their findings. They also explore the influence of water vapor on explosion pressures and propose a method to measure the dissociation of water vapor and carbon dioxide at high temperatures and atmospheric pressure.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Thermodynamics"}
