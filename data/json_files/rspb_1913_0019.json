They demonstrate that this coordination can occur through reciprocal or identical innervation, depending on the circumstances. The study focuses on the reflex actions in the vastocrureus and lateral recti muscles, showing how the balance between inhibition and excitation can lead to different muscle responses.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
