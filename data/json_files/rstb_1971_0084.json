They discovered that in the goldfish intestine, the influx of sodium and alanine is coupled, but the ratio depends on the external sodium concentration. The results suggest that a sodium gradient may not be the only driving force for active transport of amino acids in this tissue.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology and Physiology"}
