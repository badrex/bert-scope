The authors construct crystal growth diagrams for calcite rhombohedra, illustrating features of crystal initiation, shape, and growth in two dimensions. They show how the rate of maturation of the crystal fabric and optical elongation are related to crystallographic form. The technique helps identify impingement growth and distinguish between cement and other crystal aggregates, contributing to a better understanding of carbonate rocks."}
