The results suggest that intermolecular forces play a significant role in these shifts, rather than just bulk dielectric effects. The authors propose that dispersion forces and dipole-induced dipole forces are responsible for the observed shifts, and they provide equations to explain these interactions. The findings emphasize the importance of understanding the specific structural properties of solutes and solvents in predicting solvent effects on vibration bands.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
