They derive dynamic void and dislocation sink strengths and find that, under steady-state pulsing conditions, it is usually acceptable to replace dynamic sink strengths with steady-state sink strengths. However, dynamic sink strengths are required for studying damage during the initial transient under continuous irradiation conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
