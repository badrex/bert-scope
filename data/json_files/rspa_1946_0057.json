They found that the activation energy of the initiating process is responsible for starting the chains in the reaction. The results support the idea that the gas-phase dissociation of hydrogen molecules is the main method of chain initiation under these conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
