They found that these mollusks have a muscular septum instead of gills, small labial palps, and a thick muscular coating in their gut. Their feeding and digestive organs are distinct from other Lamellibranchs, and their carnivorous diet is supported by their specialized gut structure and digestive processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Mollusk Anatomy and Physiology"}
