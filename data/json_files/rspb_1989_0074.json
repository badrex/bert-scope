They used tail currents to estimate the timecourse of these changes and investigated the interaction between calcium extrusion through the Na-Ca exchange and calcium uptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The results showed that cytosolic calcium transient reached its peak around 50 ms after the action potential upstroke and fell close to diastolic levels before repolarization. Caffeine delayed the time to peak contraction and prolonged the cytosolic calcium transient.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cellular Biology and Physiology"}
