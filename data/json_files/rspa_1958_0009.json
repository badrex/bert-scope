They estimate the parameters for the atomic field by interpolating between isoelectronic series and extrapolating from known structures. The calculation uses a program on a Ferranti Mark 1 computer and provides atomic energy levels and wave functions for the uranium atom.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
