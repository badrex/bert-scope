They found that administering estrin before the expected onset of menstruation did not delay or inhibit uterine bleeding, contrary to the theory. This study suggests that the theory may not be accurate in explaining the process of menstruation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
