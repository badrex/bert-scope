They found that some alloys, such as titanium and its alloys, show excellent resistance to breakdown and corrosion in chloride solutions, making them suitable for long-term use in the human body. The study also provides insights into the mechanism of passivity breakdown and the potential applications of these alloys in other industries.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
