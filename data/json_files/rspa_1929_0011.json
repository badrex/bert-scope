They identified 314 lines in the spectrum and compared it to the spectrum of singly ionized oxygen (O+), which has the same electron structure. The study provides a partial analysis of the F III spectrum and contributes to the understanding of atomic physics and chemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Atomic Physics"}
