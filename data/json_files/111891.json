Faraday's experiments demonstrate the union of ice pieces even when capillary action is eliminated, supporting the idea that pressure is not necessary for regeneration. The flexible and rigid adhesion observed in these experiments can be explained by the melting and regelation process, which occurs due to the impact and pressure during the initial contact of the ice pieces.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
