The authors discuss the effects of various additives, such as yttrium, hafnium, and lanthanum, on the oxidation behavior of different alloys. They also examine the role of oxide dispersions in strengthening materials and reducing the growth rate of oxide scales.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Alloy Development"}
