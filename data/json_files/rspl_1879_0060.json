The author argues that the geometric mean is more suitable for calculating errors in various phenomena, such as tints, weights, temperatures, and estimates of lengths and distances. The geometric mean also applies to the majority of influences that combine with vital phenomena in sociology. The author suggests that a new law of error, based on the geometric mean, is needed to better understand and analyze these situations.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences > Sociology"}
