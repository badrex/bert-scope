Pulsars are rapidly rotating neutron stars that emit beams of radiation through their magnetic poles. They are useful for studying physics because of their stable periodicity, high magnetic fields, and dense interiors. Pulsars are found in two main groups: young, isolated pulsars and old, millisecond pulsars. The latter are often found in binary systems and are believed to be formed through a process called \"recycling.\" Pulsars have provided valuable insights into the behavior of matter in extreme gravitational and electromagnetic fields, as well as the dynamics of globular clusters and the end-points of stellar evolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
