They argue that epidemiology is limited in its ability to recognize carcinogens at low exposure levels and suggest that laboratory studies of high doses on model systems are necessary for a better understanding of the hazards. The author also emphasizes the importance of developing reliable in-vitro models for human carcinogenesis to study the effects of chronic, low-dose exposure to carcinogens.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Environmental Pollution and Health Risks"}
