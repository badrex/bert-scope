The study reveals hierarchical patterns of vegetation response to environmental change, with major shifts between forest and open vegetation communities reflecting climatic transitions. The record also shows variability within interglacial and glacial periods, providing insight into the complexity of terrestrial ecosystems' responses to climate change. The study contributes to the understanding of European Quaternary stratigraphy and land-sea correlations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Paleoclimatology"}
