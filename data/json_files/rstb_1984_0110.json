They discovered a protein called amoebapore that can incorporate into host cell membranes and induce ion channels, leading to cellular damage. Additionally, they found a highly immunogenic surface lipid involved in immune complex redistribution and shedding. These findings may contribute to the development of immunoprophylaxis for amoebiasis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
