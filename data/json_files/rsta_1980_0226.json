The authors discuss the implications of this heterogeneity for understanding the Earth's history, including the formation of the continental crust and the role of mantle convection in mixing and transporting materials. They also compare the isotopic characteristics of the upper mantle with the results of simple two-reservoir models, providing insights into the processes that have shaped the Earth over time.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
