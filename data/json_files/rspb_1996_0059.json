They found that increasing the spider's weight led to thicker and stiffer silk threads. The study also showed that the increase in diameter was accompanied by a decrease in stiffness (Young's modulus), suggesting that the silk may not be a simple, homogeneous material. This discovery could have implications for understanding spider silk production and potential applications in materials science.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology > Material Science"}
