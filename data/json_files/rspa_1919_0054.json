They found that the efficiency of observing resonance radiation depends on the narrowness of the spectral lines and the use of a sodium vacuum arc in quartz as a light source. The author also discussed the challenges and improvements in the construction of the sodium lamp and the capricious nature of resonance radiation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
