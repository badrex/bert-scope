They discovered that the pigment granules move irregularly and actively, rather than the cell processes, and suggested replacing the terms \"contracted\" and \"expanded\" with \"concentrated\" and \"dispersed\" to describe these phases. The study also found that environmental factors such as moisture, darkness, and low temperature cause a dark condition in amphibians, while dryness, light, and high temperature induce pallor.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
