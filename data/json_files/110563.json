The author, William Whewell, studied the laws governing the height of high water and observed that these laws are modified by local circumstances. He analyzed observations made at nineteen different stations, concluding that the differences in diurnal inequalities do not form a progressive series.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
