The author presents a complete set of variables, including deformation history, mechanical-stress history, temperature history, proper-time lag, and physical constants, to describe the relevant information about the matter at an event. The article covers elasticity, viscosity, and their combinations, and provides a foundation for a comprehensive relativistic theory of deformation and flow applicable to various materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Continuum Mechanics"}
