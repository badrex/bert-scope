They analyzed the composition and properties of these alloys, observing that the substitution of aluminium for zinc caused the curve to lie outside its former position. The study aimed to understand the formation of atomic compounds between metals and their impact on alloy properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Metallurgy"}
