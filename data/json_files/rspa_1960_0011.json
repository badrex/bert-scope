They identified and observed the behavior of radicals involved in the combustion process, providing further information on the combustion mechanisms of these aldehydes. The study focused on the reaction between formyl radicals and oxygen, which is significant in the combustion of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Combustion Chemistry"}
