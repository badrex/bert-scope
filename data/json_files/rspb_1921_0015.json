These larvae exhibited a complete mirror-image of the normal form. The author discusses possible explanations for this reversal, including dissociation of blastomeres, obliteration of pore-canal, activation of the right anterior coelom, and restoration of the left hydrocoele's external communication. This research contributes to the understanding of echinoderm development and embryology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Echinoderm Development"}
