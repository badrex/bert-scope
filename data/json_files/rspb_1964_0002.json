They discovered that lymphocytes migrate across the vessel wall by entering the endothelial cells and traversing their cytoplasm, rather than passing through the intercellular junctions. This research provides insights into the immune system's function and the role of lymphocytes in the body.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
