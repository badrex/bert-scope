It also explores the effects of buildings and urban areas on local wind patterns and the travel and dispersion of pollutants. The article provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge on wind structure near the ground and its implications for architectural and aeronautical aerodynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
