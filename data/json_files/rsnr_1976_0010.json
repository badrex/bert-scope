Key figures such as John Flamsteed, Nevil Maskelyne, and George Airy are highlighted for their contributions to understanding gravity and the Earth's shape, while the discovery of Neptune and the testing of Newton's law of gravitation are also discussed.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
