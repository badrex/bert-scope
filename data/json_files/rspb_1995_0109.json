By manipulating the black coloration on male guppies, researchers found that females were less attracted to males with reduced black area. This supports the idea that female choice can maintain seemingly non-preferred ornaments in male animals. The findings contribute to understanding the evolution of multiple male ornaments in species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Behavior and Evolution"}
