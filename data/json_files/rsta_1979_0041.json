The authors develop a set of transport equations for the average velocity and scalar fields, and propose a method to estimate the joint probability density function from its first and second moments. The study aims to provide a more accurate and realistic model for calculating local flame properties, such as temperature, in turbulent flames.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
