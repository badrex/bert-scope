They found that the fungus's spores require digestion in gastric juice to germinate and grow into mycelia capable of infecting horn. The research has implications for understanding the decomposition of hair, horn, feathers, and hoofs used as manure in agriculture.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Mycology"}
