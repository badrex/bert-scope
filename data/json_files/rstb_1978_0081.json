Cytokinins are plant hormones that can be used as a standard in bioassay systems, and their effects on whole plants can be manipulated experimentally. The article reviews various biochemical investigations of cytokinin functions, including their impact on protein and RNA synthesis, proteolysis, and RNA metabolism. Cytokinins also play a role in plant tissue culture, promoting cell differentiation and organogenesis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
