It describes the three antagonistic pairs of muscles that operate the prothoraco-coxal joint around three different axes and the flexor and extensor muscles at the coxo-trochanteral, femoro-tibial, and tibio-tarsal joints. The research also identifies the location of motor neuron somata and compares the leg musculature, innervation pattern, and motor neuron somata location with other orthopteroid insects.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
