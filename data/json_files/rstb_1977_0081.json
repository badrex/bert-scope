The authors highlight the use of radio echo sounding techniques to map the ice sheet and gain insights into its dynamics, thermodynamics, and past history. They also emphasize the need for further research and exploration to better understand the complex geology and environmental factors of the Antarctic region.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Glaciology"}
