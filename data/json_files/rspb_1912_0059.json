They found that these enzymes, such as linase, amygdalase, prunase, and salicase, have varying distributions in different plant species. The study also highlights the importance of understanding the influence of season and environmental factors on enzyme activity in plants.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
