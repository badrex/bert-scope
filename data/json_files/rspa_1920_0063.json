The authors investigate the motion of a shell in the air, focusing on the forces acting on it and the resulting trajectory. They analyze the initial motion of the shell and the effects of gravity on its angular motion. The study provides valuable insights into the behavior of shells with different axial spins and helps determine the exact spin required for a stable shell.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
