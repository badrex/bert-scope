They discovered that extremely small objects and details can be seen using high-powered microscopes, and they discuss the effects of light diffraction and visual angles on the visibility of these objects. The author also compares their findings to astronomical observations and the behavior of organic tissues under a microscope.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
