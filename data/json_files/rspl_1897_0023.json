The author divides stars into different types based on their spectra and suggests that stars in the first stage of development are helium stars. The study also discusses the distribution of stars in different areas of the galaxy and the possibility of the sun being near the lower boundary of the galaxy.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrophysics"}
