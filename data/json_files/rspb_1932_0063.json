The researchers found that the symptoms are not due to loss of weight or general inanition, but are directly related to the administration of vitamin B1. The study also shows that the oxidative behavior of pigeon's brain tissue improves after receiving vitamin B1 doses, proving that the symptoms are specific to vitamin deficiency and independent of general nutrition.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
