The authors describe the retrieval methods used to obtain concentration profiles and discuss the importance of nitrogen oxides in stratospheric chemistry. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the chemical processes occurring in the stratosphere and the role of nitrogen oxides in these processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
