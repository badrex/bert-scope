The lake's unique features, such as its constant dominance by blue-green algae and herbivorous animals, make it an ideal site for studying the upper limits of aquatic primary production. The study highlights the importance of nutrient recycling within the lake, which meets the day-to-day requirements of the phytoplankton, and the lake's hydrological stability maintained by the Kazinga Channel.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Limnology"}
