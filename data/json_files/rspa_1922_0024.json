They used a combination of experimental work and theoretical models to analyze the spectrum, providing insights into the behavior of molecules and atoms that emit the light. Their findings have implications for understanding other band spectra, such as the ammonia band.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Spectroscopy"}
