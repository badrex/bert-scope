They find that the maximum number of limit cycles depends on the degree of the polynomials involved and the stability of the critical points. This research contributes to the understanding of the behavior of these systems and has implications for applications in physics and engineering.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Dynamical Systems"}
