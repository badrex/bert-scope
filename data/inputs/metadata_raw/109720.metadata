To Which Are Added Some Further Observations on the Rectification of the Hyperbola: Among Which the Great Advantage of Descending Series over Ascending Series,in many Cases,Is Clearly Shown; and Several Methods Are Given for Computing the Constant Quantity by Which Those Series Differ from Each other.
