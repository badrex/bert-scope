To Which are Added Some Further Observations on the Rectification of the Hyperbola: Among Which the Great Advantage of Descending Series over Ascending Series, in Many Cases, Is Clearly Shown; And Several Methods Are Given for Computing the Constant Quantity by Which Those Series Differ from Each Other.
