tldr: This study investigates the genetic control of mimicry and polymorphism in the butterfly Hypolimnas bolina. The researchers found that the polymorphism is sex-limited to the female and controlled by two unlinked loci. The mimetic form is dominant or semi-dominant, and the detailed resemblance between the model and mimic is enhanced by the selection of specific modifiers of the pattern. The study concludes that the absence of a supergene in Hypolimnas bolina is due to the species being monomorphic for the mimetic form in much of its range.
