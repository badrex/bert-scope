tldr: The author, A. Waller, conducted experiments to study the so-called vesicular vapours of water, which are present in steam and clouds. Using a microscope and various liquids, Waller observed that these vapours consist of minute globules or spherules of water, rather than small vesicles as previously believed. The author also explained the colors observed in condensed vapours, which were due to the diffraction of light by the particles in suspension, rather than the thickness of the vesicles or the vesicular theory.
