tldr: The author examines the color pigments in the bile of invertebrates and the antiseptic properties of creosote oils. They found that the color pigments in invertebrate bile are different from those in vertebrates, with the exception of haemochromogen. The author also discovered a chlorophyll pigment in the bile of mollusks and some arthropods. Additionally, the antiseptic alkaloids in creosote oils were found to have potential medical applications.
