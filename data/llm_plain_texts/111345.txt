tldr: The author discusses various methods for rapid signaling through electric telegraphs, focusing on methods for longer distances and the potential for faster communication. They propose using different strengths of current for different signals and describe a system of suspended magnets to record these signals. The author also explores the possibility of sending multiple signals per second through submarine cables and suggests improvements to the key-board and clockwork mechanisms for faster communication.
