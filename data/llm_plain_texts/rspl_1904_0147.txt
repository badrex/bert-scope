tldr: The author investigates the phosphorescence caused by beta and gamma rays of radium and explores the chemical reactions and luminescence induced by these rays. They observe various substances exposed to the rays and study the effects of temperature on phosphorescence and coloration. The study provides insights into the connection between chemical, coloration, and luminescent effects of the beta and gamma rays.
