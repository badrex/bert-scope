tldr: The author, Robert Mallet, conducted experiments to determine the specific gravity of molten cast iron and found that it has a lower density than when solid. He also disproved the idea that cast iron and iron slags expand in volume during solidification, which was previously used to support theories about lunar volcanic action.
