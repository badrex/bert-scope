tldr: 'William Herschel conducted experiments to investigate the cause of the colored concentric rings discovered by Sir Isaac Newton between two object-glasses laid upon one another. He found that these rings could be produced by various methods, including using lenses of different focal lengths and placing them on different surfaces. Herschel's experiments expanded on Newton's observations and contributed to a better understanding of the phenomena of light and its modifications.'
