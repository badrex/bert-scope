tldr: The author presents a simplified approach to analyze inductively coupled low resistance circuits. By neglecting damping, the author derives expressions for frequencies, amplitudes, and coupling directly from the differential equations of the circuits. A graphical method is also introduced to solve the problem. This study has implications for understanding the behavior of electrical circuits and their applications in wireless telegraphy.
