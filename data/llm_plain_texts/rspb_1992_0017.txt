tldr: This study investigates how extracellular cations affect the sensitivity of ATP-K+ channels in rat ventromedial hypothalamic neurons. The researchers found that under physiological ionic gradients, intracellular ATP inhibits channel activity, but this sensitivity is modulated by extracellular cations. In contrast, ATP-K+ channels from an insulin-secreting cell line (CRI-G1) were not affected by extracellular cations.
