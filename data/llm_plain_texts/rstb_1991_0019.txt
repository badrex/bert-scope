tldr: The article discusses the development and regeneration of the nervous system, focusing on experimental manipulation of cerebral cortical areas in primates. The author presents the radial unit hypothesis, which explains how the organization of neurons in the cerebral cortex is determined by their time and sequence of origin in the proliferative zone. The study also highlights the importance of cell-cell interactions in the establishment of synaptic circuitry and the potential implications for congenital or acquired brain abnormalities.
