tldr: The author, Francesco Travagino, presents a new system of natural philosophy and medicine based on two salts, Acidum and Salsum. He claims that these principles explain the properties of various substances, including minerals, vegetables, and animals. Travagino also discusses the causes of fermentation, generation, concretion, putrefaction, precipitation, and other phenomena, as well as the properties of dissolvents, tastes, odors, and colors. He applies this system to the art of medicine, explaining the nature of humors, vital heat, motion, and the faculties of animal bodies, as well as the causes of diseases and their remedies.
