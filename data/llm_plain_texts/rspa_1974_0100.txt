tldr: The authors explore alternative Fock quantization of neutrinos in flat space-time using Rindler and Penrose coordinates. They find that the definition of positive frequency solutions differs in Rindler coordinates compared to Minkowski coordinates, leading to inequivalent Fock representations. In contrast, the positive frequency solutions in the Penrose conformal metric are equivalent to those in Minkowski space-time.
