tldr: This study investigates the lifetimes of adsorbed hydrogen molecules on a slightly oxidized nickel surface using a molecular beam technique. The experiments show that the evaporation of hydrogen from the surface follows a first-order process, with a rate constant of. The results provide insights into the adsorption process and the strength of the binding between hydrogen molecules and the nickel surface.
