tldr: The author presents a new method for propelling vessels using a spiral-shaped propeller. The propeller, resembling the spiral of Archimedes, rotates within a box and creates resistance by the difference in distances between the ends of the spiral. This design allows for efficient water movement and improved vessel propulsion.
