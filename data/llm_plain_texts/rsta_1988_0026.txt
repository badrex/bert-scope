tldr: This article discusses the development of integrated geographic information systems (GIS) for the effective exploitation of remotely sensed data. It examines key issues in designing an integrated GIS, focusing on data types, data input, data storage, data access, data output, data display, utilities, and user interface. The authors propose a new term, 'geoschema,' to describe the organization of geographical datasets and emphasize the importance of efficient data handling and user-friendly interfaces for future GIS systems.
