tldr: The author presents an analytical solution for the secular changes in the motion of a fluid planet and its satellite, considering various factors such as the planet's density, angular velocity, and satellite's mass and orbit. The study helps understand the effects of frictional tides on the system and provides insights into the history and evolution of such celestial bodies.
