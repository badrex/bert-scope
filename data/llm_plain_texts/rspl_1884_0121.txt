tldr: This article investigates the mydriasis (pupil dilation) caused by the local application of cocaine to the eye and explores its interactions with other drugs like atropine, pilocarpine, and eserine. The author found that cocaine quickly and significantly dilates the pupil, and this effect can be combined with other drugs to achieve a more controlled dilation. The research also shows that cocaine mydriasis is not affected by section of the 3rd nerve and can be antagonized by eserine and pilocarpine.
