tldr: The authors develop a method to find the number of ways to arrange particles on a lattice with given numbers of neighbors. They apply this method to the case of particles on two horizontal straight lines and provide expressions for the number of arrangements. This work has implications for understanding particle arrangements in statistical mechanics.
