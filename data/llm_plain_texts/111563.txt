tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the influence of white light, different colored rays, and darkness on the development, growth, and nutrition of animals and plants. The results showed that animal development is not directly influenced by light, while plant development requires light for its nutritive processes. This research challenges preconceived notions about the role of light in animal and plant development.
