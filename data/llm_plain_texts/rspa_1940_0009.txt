tldr: The author investigates the emission spectrum of hydrocarbon flames, focusing on the effects of pressure and ethylene-hydrogen mixtures. They observe changes in the flame's color and emission spectrum as the ethylene content increases, and discover the conditions that lead to carbon deposition and the disappearance of certain spectral bands. The study provides valuable insights into the chemistry of flames and the factors affecting their properties.
