tldr: The authors studied the hydrogen flocculi and their structure in the solar atmosphere. They discovered that dark hydrogen flocculi are due to increased absorption, while bright flocculi represent regions of increased radiation. The authors also found that hydrogen and calcium occupy the same regions of the chromosphere and prominences, but with different forms when photographed with their respective lines. This research helps to understand the behavior and structure of the solar atmosphere.
