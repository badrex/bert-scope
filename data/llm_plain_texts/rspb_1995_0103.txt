tldr: The study investigates the impact of the parasite Microphallus papillorobustus on two closely related host species, Gammarus insensibilis and Gammarus aequicauda. The results show that the parasite has a stronger effect on the survival of G. insensibilis, leading to higher mortality rates due to altered behavior and increased vulnerability to predation. This differential impact on host mortality is linked to the parasite's virulence and the host species' susceptibility to infection.
