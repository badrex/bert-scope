tldr: The authors apply relaxation methods to solve engineering problems related to stress distribution in elastic solids of revolution. They use finite-difference approximations to solve problems involving torsional stresses, flexural stresses, and shearing stresses in various shapes. The methods provide accurate results for practical purposes and can be used to improve the design of engineering structures.
