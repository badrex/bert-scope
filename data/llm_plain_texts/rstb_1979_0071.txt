tldr: The author examines the significance of low-density populations of the African armyworm, Spodoptera exempta, in causing outbreaks of the pest. They discuss the importance of moths emerging from both known outbreaks and low-density populations, and how weather patterns may influence the migration and concentration of these moths. The author suggests that low-density populations in seasonally green grasslands may be a significant source of moths causing armyworm outbreaks.
