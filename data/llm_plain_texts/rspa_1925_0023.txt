tldr: The authors developed a method to create small pots of electrically fused refractory materials using centrifugal force and an electric arc. This technique allows for the creation of pots with a glazed internal surface, which can be made from materials such as magnesia, alumina, zirconia, and tungsten metal. The process has potential for further applications in manufacturing larger pots and tubes of refractory materials or high-melting-point metals.
