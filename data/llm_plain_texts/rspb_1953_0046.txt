tldr: The authors conducted experiments on potato tubers to study the respiratory and carbohydrate metabolism after being exposed to anaerobic conditions. They found that the content of lactic acid increased significantly after 8 days in nitrogen, while the sucrose content decreased. The study also showed that the rate of CO2 production increased during the after-effect period.
