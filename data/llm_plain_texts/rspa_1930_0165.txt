tldr: The authors conducted a study to understand the global distribution and annual variations of ozone in Earth's atmosphere. They collected data from various locations worldwide and found that the ozone content is low and uniform throughout the autumn hemisphere. The study also revealed that the behavior of ozone in India differs from that in temperate regions, as it remains unaffected by the monsoon. The authors concluded that further research is needed to establish the connection between ozone and meteorological conditions.
