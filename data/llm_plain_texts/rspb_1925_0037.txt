revised_title: 'The Impact of Breathing Rich Oxygen Mixtures on Maximal Oxygen Intake During Exercise'

  - Heart circulation
tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of breathing mixtures rich in oxygen on the oxygen intake during exercise. They found that the maximal oxygen intake can increase by 50% when breathing such mixtures. This increase is attributed to an increased circulation rate of the blood, suggesting that the heart muscle can change its output per beat according to the degree of unsaturation of the arterial blood.'
