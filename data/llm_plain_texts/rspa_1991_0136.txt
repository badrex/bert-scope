tldr: This article discusses the various energy balance concepts used in fracture physics, focusing on the Griffith theory and its relation to thermodynamics. It highlights the importance of understanding energy balance when dealing with crack extension and fracture toughening mechanisms. The author emphasizes that a clear distinction should be made between energy balances based on the first and second laws of thermodynamics, as they yield different results and insights.
