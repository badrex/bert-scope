tldr: The authors present an integral equation method to solve the torsion problem for cross-sections of any shape or form. This method focuses on the warping function, which is harmonic in the cross-section and satisfies the boundary condition. The torsional rigidity and boundary shear stress can be calculated using the formulae provided, and the axial displacement component and the two shear stress components can be generated throughout the cross-section. This method offers an accurate and efficient solution compared to other analytical or numerical methods.
