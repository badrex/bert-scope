tldr: 'Fr. Hauksbee conducted an experiment to compare the freezing of common water and water purged of air. He found that water purged of air freezes more easily and has a different structure than common water. The experiment showed that the ice produced from the water purged of air had a greater increase in volume compared to common water.'
