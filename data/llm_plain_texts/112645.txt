tldr: The author conducted actinometrical observations on the summit of Mont Blanc and at Chamonix to study solar radiation and its effects on the atmosphere. They developed a new actinometer to measure solar intensity, which helped determine the ratio of average intensity at the two stations. The author also discussed the importance of comparing their results with previous experiments and the need for further research on the topic.
