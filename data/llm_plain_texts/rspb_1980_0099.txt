tldr: This study investigates the importance of phosphorus in the growth and species composition of microalgal populations in mixed cultures. The researchers found that phosphorus plays a crucial role in determining the growth rate and species dominance in phosphorus-limited environments. They established a mathematical model to predict the behavior of microalgae in mixed cultures and found that the model accurately simulates the experimental results. The findings can help in understanding and managing algal blooms in water bodies.
