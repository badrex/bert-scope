tldr: This study investigates the role of peripheral antibody neutralization and central inhibition in immunological paralysis caused by type III pneumococcal polysaccharide. The researchers found that a state of pseudo-paralysis due to peripheral neutralization with antigen exists, which must be distinguished from the authentic paralysed state. This finding challenges the reliance on circulating antibody titration as a guide to the establishment of tolerance in this system.
