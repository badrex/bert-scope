tldr: The author describes the reconstruction of the dorsal shield and endoskeleton of Polacanthus Foxii, a dinosaur species. The shield was reconstructed using fragments found in the cliffs and is now complete, allowing for a better understanding of the dinosaur's anatomy. The author also discusses the osseous structure of the shield and the pelvic bones, providing insights into the dinosaur's skeletal structure and its position when it sank into the ooze.
