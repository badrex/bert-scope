tldr: The author, Edward Schunck, investigates the decomposition of rubian, a substance found in madder, and its products. He discovers that rubian decomposes into five substances: alizarine, verantine, rubiretine, rubianine, and sugar. These substances have different properties and uses, with alizarine being a well-known colorant. Schunck also explores the methods for obtaining pure rubian and its potential applications in various industries.
