tldr: This article discusses the concept of reproductive selection and its impact on the evolution of populations. The authors analyze the relationship between fertility and physical characteristics, such as stature, and demonstrate that reproductive selection can have a significant influence on the evolution of human populations. They also highlight the importance of considering reproductive selection as a factor in evolution, which may be as powerful as natural selection.
