tldr: This article examines the reptiles from the Triassic period in the Elgin area, focusing on Stagonolepis, Dasygnathus, and their allies. The author re-describes the maxilla Dasygnathus longidens and a pterygoid from the same locality, indicating a large carnivorous pseudosuchian related to Erythrosuchus. The author also provides a detailed description of the osteology of Stagonolepis, revealing its close relationship to Aetosaurus from the Stubensandstein of Germany. The study suggests that the Triassic sandstone of Elgin may occupy a higher horizon than previously believed.
