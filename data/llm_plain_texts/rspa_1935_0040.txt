tldr: The authors used X-ray diffraction to study the crystal structure of alums. They determined the positions of potassium, aluminum, sulfur, oxygen, and water molecules in the crystal lattice. The structure revealed that the sulfate groups form regular tetrahedra, and the water molecules surround the aluminum atom in a nearly regular octahedron. This research provides insights into the arrangement of atoms and molecules in alums and contributes to the understanding of crystal structures in inorganic chemistry.
