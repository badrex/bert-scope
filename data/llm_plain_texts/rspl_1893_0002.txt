tldr: This article is an obituary for James Thomson, a pioneering civil engineer and inventor. He made significant contributions to the field of civil engineering, including the design of the vortex water-wheel and the explanation of the slow motion of semi-fluid masses like glaciers. His work on the lowering of the freezing point of water by pressure and the plasticity of ice were also groundbreaking and influenced future research in thermodynamics and ice physics.
