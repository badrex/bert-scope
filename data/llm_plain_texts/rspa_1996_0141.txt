tldr: This study investigates the reaction-diffusion of fuel with air in planar solid oxide fuel cells stacked with ceramic felt. The researchers developed a mathematical model and conducted experiments to understand the behavior of oxygen and fuel concentrations in the cells. The findings can be used to design more efficient and cost-effective solid oxide fuel cell systems.
