tldr: This study investigates the process of severe metallic wear, specifically the wear of brass against harder materials. The research focuses on the relationship between metal transfer and the formation of wear particles. The authors discovered that the wear process has at least two distinct stages: the removal of metal from the wearing surface by transfer and the formation of wear debris from the transferred layer on the opposing member. The applied load determines the scale of the phenomena rather than the rate at which they occur.
