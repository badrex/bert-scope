tldr: The author discusses their experiments to determine the ultraviolet limit of the solar spectrum. They found that the limit of visibility is influenced by factors such as atmospheric transparency, the sensitivity of the photographic emulsion, and the exposure time. The author also notes that it is difficult to obtain accurate results due to various errors and limitations, but they provide suggestions for improving the process.
