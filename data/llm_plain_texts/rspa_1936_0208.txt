tldr: The authors investigate the electrical properties of high permeability wires carrying alternating current, particularly focusing on the effects of external magnetic fields. They discover that these wires have a higher AC resistance and self-inductance compared to non-magnetic wires. The AC resistance significantly changes when an external magnetic field is applied, which could have implications for the design and efficiency of electrical devices.
