tldr: This article discusses the observations and analysis of a fiery meteor that appeared on November 26, 1758. The author, John Pringle, examines the meteor's path, size, velocity, and other characteristics based on various accounts from observers. He concludes that the meteor's course was affected by the Earth's atmosphere and wind currents, and that its speed was incredibly fast, moving at over 100 times the speed of a typical cannonball. The meteor's tail was likely composed of a mixture of flames, sparks, and vapors, while its size is estimated to be around 1.5 miles in diameter.
