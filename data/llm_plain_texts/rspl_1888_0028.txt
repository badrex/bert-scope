tldr: This article presents a method for measuring the light of the spectrum reflected from colored bodies, such as pigments, in terms of the light of the spectrum reflected from a white surface. The authors describe their apparatus and the process of isolating specific colors from the spectrum to measure their brightness. They also discuss the creation of gray by combining different colors and the reproduction of pigments using this method.
