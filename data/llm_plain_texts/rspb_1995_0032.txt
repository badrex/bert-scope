tldr: The authors present a dynamic food web model based on the ratio-dependent trophic model, which demonstrates that food web structures can change significantly between equilibrium and non-equilibrium states. They find that near equilibrium, species interact with fewer other species, while far from equilibrium, many more trophic interactions are involved. This supports the idea that only a limited number of factors determine the dynamics of populations near a steady state.
