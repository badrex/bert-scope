tldr: The author, Nevil Maskelyne, discusses the expected return of the comet of 1532 and 1661 in 1788, based on Dr. Halley's predictions and calculations. He explains the effects of Jupiter and Saturn on the comet's orbit and the importance of accurate observations to determine its elliptic orbit and identity with previous comets. Maskelyne also provides calculations and suggestions for observing the comet with telescopes.
