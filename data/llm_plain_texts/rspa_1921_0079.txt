tldr: The author studied the spectrum of ionized potassium and discovered over 150 new wavelengths in addition to those previously observed by Schillinger. They found that the enhanced spectrum of potassium is similar to the red and blue spectra of argon, supporting Sommerfeld's theory on atomic structure. The study aimed to test the theory by comparing the ratios of the frequencies of the wave-lengths in the red and blue spectra of argon with those of the enhanced spectrum of potassium.
