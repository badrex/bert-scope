tldr: This study investigates the role of hotspots in the evolution of lek mating systems in neotropical birds. The hotspot hypothesis suggests that male dispersion is determined by female distributions, leading to the formation of leks where female densities are highest. The research tests three predictions related to interspecific patterns of lek distribution in sympatric species. The results show that leks of the four studied species were significantly clustered, supporting the hotspot hypothesis and its role in lek evolution.
