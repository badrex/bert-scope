tldr: John Fletcher Miller conducted meteorological experiments in the Lake District, measuring rainfall at various heights up to 3166 feet above sea level. He discovered a new station, "the Sty," on Sprinkling Fell, which recorded nearly one-third more rain than the previously wettest spot in the region. The author also compared the rainfall data from 1850 and 1848, with 189.49 inches and 211.62 inches, respectively.
