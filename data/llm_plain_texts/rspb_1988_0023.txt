tldr: This study investigates the eyes of two species of cave-dwelling harvestmen, Megalopsalis tumida and Hendea myersi cavernicola, found in New Zealand glow-worm caves. Despite living in a dark environment, these harvestmen have retained their eyes, which are sensitive to a range of light intensities and have a unique structure. The research provides insights into the adaptation and survival of these creatures in the cave ecosystem.
