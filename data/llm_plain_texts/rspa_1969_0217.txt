tldr: The authors conducted an experimental study to assess the effect of elasticity on the flow of elastico-viscous liquids through curved pipes under a pressure gradient. They found that the general flow pattern for elastico-viscous liquids is similar to that for Newtonian liquids, consisting of two spirals separated by the central plane. Elasticity has a significant effect on the pitch of these spirals, enhancing the flow rate in the laminar flow and transition region but reducing it in turbulent flow at high Reynolds numbers.
