tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments to study the fluorescence and channelled absorption of bismuth at high temperatures. They found that bismuth vapour shows both lines and bands in absorption, and that the fluorescence spectrum is the complement of the absorption spectrum. The authors also discussed the possible reasons for the fine structure of some bands and the relationship between critical potentials of elements and molecular radiation processes.'
