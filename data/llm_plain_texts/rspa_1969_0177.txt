tldr: The authors investigated the radiation chemistry of liquid and glassy methanol using pulse radiolysis, low-temperature optical spectroscopy, and electron spin resonance. They studied the behavior of solvated and trapped electrons, as well as the reactions of these intermediates with the solvent and various solutes. The results provide insights into the radiation-induced processes in alcohols and related systems.
