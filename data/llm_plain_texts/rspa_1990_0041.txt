tldr: The authors present a moment asymptotic expansion technique for the analysis of generalized functions, which holds for various types of kernels, including those of rapid decay and rapid oscillation. This approach allows for the study of asymptotic expansions of integrals, series, and multidimensional cases, and is applicable to several spaces of distributions. The technique also provides error bounds and can be used in diverse fields of mathematics and physics.
