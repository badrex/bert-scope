tldr: This study investigates the course of respiration in sweet pea seeds during germination. The researchers used a katharometer to measure the carbon dioxide output of individual seeds, finding that the rate of respiration increased rapidly after seeds were placed in water and then stabilized at a certain level. The findings contribute to the understanding of plant respiration and its role in seed development.
