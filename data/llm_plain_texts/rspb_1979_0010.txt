tldr: The author investigates the histology and histogenesis of tooth plates in Sagenodus inaequalis, focusing on the growth and replacement mechanisms of the tooth plate. They describe a specialized character, hypermineralized dentine or petrodentine, found within the tooth plates, which sheds light on the phylogenetic organization of dipnoans. The study provides insights into the evolution and relationships of tooth plate-bearing dipnoans.
