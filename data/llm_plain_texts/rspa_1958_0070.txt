tldr: The author conducted a study to determine the age of the red granite in the Bushveld Complex using the rubidium-strontium dating method. They compared the ages of the granite samples from different locations, analyzing both the total rock and separated mineral fractions. The results showed that the ages determined were not significantly different, indicating that the method of total rock determination is a reliable alternative to the traditional single-mineral method.
