tldr: The article discusses the double layer theory in ionic crystals and electrolytes, focusing on the role of crystal defects and space charge regions. The author proposes that the double layer can consist of two space-charge regions, one in the crystal and the other in the electrolyte, and derives equations to express the potential difference across these regions in terms of the physical constants of the system.
