tldr: 'This article discusses the discovery of the earliest known petrified stems of angiosperms from the Aptian formation, Lower Greensand in England. The three specimens, belonging to three new genera, provide valuable information about the anatomy and early history of angiosperms, which were previously thought to be absent in Northern Europe during the Aptian period.'
