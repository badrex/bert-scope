tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments to study the scattering of cathode rays, which are fast electrons. They used a magnetic deflection method to create a homogeneous beam of cathode rays and measured their intensity directly on a galvanometer. The experiments aimed to determine the dependence of the scattering on the energy of the rays and the nuclear charge of the atom encountered. The results provided insights into the behavior of cathode rays and their interactions with atomic nuclei.'
