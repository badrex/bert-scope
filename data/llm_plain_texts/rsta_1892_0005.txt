tldr: The author investigates the locus of singular points and lines in the intersections of a system of surfaces. They extend previous work on the subject to include rational and integral functions of coordinates and parameters. The study focuses on the cases where there is one or two independent parameters and provides insights into the properties of the envelope locus, conic nodes, and binodal lines.
