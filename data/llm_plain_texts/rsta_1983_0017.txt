tldr: The authors apply Morse theory methods to the Yang-Mills functional over a compact Riemann surface and deduce results about the cohomology of the moduli spaces of stable algebraic vector bundles over the Riemann surface. They analyze the interplay between holomorphic and unitary structures and provide a detailed study of the Yang-Mills equations over Riemann surfaces of arbitrary genus.
