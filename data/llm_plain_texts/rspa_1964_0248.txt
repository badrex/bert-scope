tldr: The authors explore a mechanism to control crack propagation in all-brittle systems by examining the stress distribution near the tip of a crack. They found that tensile stresses parallel to the crack plane exist ahead of the crack tip, and if a weak interface is present, it can break and create a secondary crack, interfering with the primary crack's progress. The authors suggest that increasing the ratio of adhesive strength to cohesive strength of the solid can significantly enhance the strength and toughness of brittle materials.
