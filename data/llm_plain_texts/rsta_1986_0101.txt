revised_title: Brittle Failure in Compression: Micromechanics, Faulting, and Brittle-Ductile Transition
semantic_tags:
  - Rock mechanics
  - Brittle failure
  - Confining pressure
  - Faulting
  - Brittle-ductile transition
tldr: This article examines the micromechanics of brittle failure in compression and the transition from brittle to ductile failure under increasing confining pressures. The authors review the axial splitting and faulting processes, present new mathematical models and experimental results, and discuss the implications of the brittle-ductile transition in brittle solids like rock and concrete.
