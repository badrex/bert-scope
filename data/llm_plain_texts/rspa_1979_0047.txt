tldr: The author presents a distributed soliton solution for the Korteweg-de Vries equation, which describes the interaction of skewed one-dimensional solitons. The solution is derived from a resonant interaction of solitons and is analyzed using asymptotic methods. The distributed soliton solution reveals a fascinating structure that resembles discrete soliton interactions but with regions of rational functions instead of exponential variations.
