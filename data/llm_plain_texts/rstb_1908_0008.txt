tldr: This article investigates the factors affecting the ascent of water in trees, focusing on the role of capillary action, surface tension, and osmosis. The author critiques previous theories and experiments, including those by Strasburger and Copeland, and provides new observations and insights into the complex process of water flow in plants. The article emphasizes the importance of understanding hydrostatic conditions in wood vessels for a comprehensive understanding of the ascent of sap.
