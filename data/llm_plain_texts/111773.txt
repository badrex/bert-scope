tldr: The author presents a comprehensive study of the equations and principles of elasticity in solids, focusing on the internal equilibrium of non-isotropic and isotropic elastic solids. The paper provides a detailed method for solving the general integrals of these equations, considering various processes and conditions, and offering a foundation for understanding the behavior of elastic materials under different pressures and forces.
