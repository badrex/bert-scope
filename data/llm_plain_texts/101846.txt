tldr: The author discusses the phenomenon of why dissolved bodies float in liquids lighter than themselves, such as mercury in strong spirit of nitre. They argue that the existing law of hydrostatics is insufficient to explain this behavior, as it does not consider the natural inclination of liquid particles to unite and resist separation. The author suggests that when a body is dissolved into tiny particles, its gravity may be insufficient to overcome the resistance of the liquid's cohesive forces, causing the particles to float. This explanation does not contradict the internal motion of liquid particles, which can still play a role in dissolving solid bodies.
