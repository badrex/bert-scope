tldr: The author investigates the stability of the pear-shaped figure of a rotating mass of liquid, focusing on the mathematical and physical aspects of the problem. They analyze the equations and methods used to compute the harmonics and stability of the figure, concluding that the pear-shaped figure is unstable. The author also discusses the differences between their findings and those of M. Lapounoff, another mathematician who reached an opposite conclusion.
