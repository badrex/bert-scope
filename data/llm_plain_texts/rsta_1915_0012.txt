tldr: This article presents a series of experiments on the thermal properties of carbonic acid at low temperatures. The authors conducted throttling experiments to study the behavior of the gas and improve the accuracy of their chart. They used a new calorimeter to measure heat and determined the variation of specific heat with temperature. The results were used to plot new constant-pressure lines on the chart and correct the gas-limit curve, providing valuable information for refrigeration calculations.
