tldr: The author presents a new method of considering geometrical curves from the sections of a solid, which has been overlooked by geometers. This method involves creating an incurvated surface and extending it to generate various sections of infinite lines. The author also discusses five types of sections that can be made from the solid, resulting in conic hyperbolas, parabolas, or right lines.
