tldr: This article presents a geological reconnaissance of the Atlantic continental margin of Europe, conducted through continuous reflexion profiling and Asdic (side-looking sonar) coverage. The study provides an outline of the post-Palaeozoic history of the region and indicates the age of the adjacent portion of the Atlantic Ocean. The authors describe the processes shaping the continental margin, including erosion, downwarping, faulting, canyon erosion, slumping, and deposition. The research suggests two phases of continental drift in the region.
