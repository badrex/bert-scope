tldr: The study investigates a metapopulation model to understand the influence of ecological and genetical parameters on local adaptation of parasites and the spatial distribution of resistance and virulence genes. The model suggests that ecological parameters, such as parasite growth rate and host and parasite migration rates, have a significant impact on coevolutionary outcomes. The results indicate that parasites are more likely to be adapted to their local host population when the parasite migration rate is larger than the host migration rate, and vice versa.
