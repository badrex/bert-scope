tldr: The authors describe a photomicrographic technique to determine the geometrical shape of glass jet viscometer orifices and analyze the flow behavior of liquids at high rates of shear. They find that the length/diameter ratio of the constant diameter section of these orifices governs the highest Reynolds number for attaining a 95% parabolic velocity profile. They also discuss the effects of orifice shape and pressure recovery on the kinetic energy correction coefficient and the admissible range of Reynolds numbers for 95% development of parabolic velocity profile.
