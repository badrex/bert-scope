tldr: This article presents a series of experiments aimed at improving the art of gunnery. It focuses on determining the point-blank distance, finding the ideal powder charge for any piece, and identifying which gun shoots the farthest. The author provides detailed instructions for conducting these experiments, including the use of canvas and paper to measure bullet trajectory and the importance of precise measurements and environmental factors. These experiments were intended to help gunners improve their accuracy and effectiveness in battle.
