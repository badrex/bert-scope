tldr: The author's study investigates the ability of vaginal epithelial cells in rabbits to engulf and process foreign substances, such as graphite particles, carmine, bacteria, and fats. They discovered that the vaginal epithelium, particularly the non-ciliated columnar cells, can actively take up and process these substances. The author also observed that the presence of white blood cells can influence the phagocytic activity of the epithelial cells.
