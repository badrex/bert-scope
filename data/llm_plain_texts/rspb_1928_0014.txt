tldr: The authors demonstrate a microchemical method called Feulgen's Reaction to study chromatin content in normal and malignant cells. They find that the reaction provides a precise color reaction for thymus-nucleic acid protein complexes and can be applied to various animal cells. The method helps in understanding the chromatin content in different types of cells and its role in cell biology.
