tldr: The authors studied the correlation between fluctuating asymmetry and sexual selection in the canine teeth of 21 species of Old World primates. They found that mean asymmetry was significantly correlated with measures of sexual selection, such as canine dimorphism, canine size, mass dimorphism, and intra-male competition, but not with diet or body size. This research provides insights into the role of sexual selection in shaping the physical traits of primates.
