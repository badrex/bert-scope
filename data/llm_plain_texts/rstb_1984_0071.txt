tldr: This article discusses the ecological effects of deposited sulfur and nitrogen compounds on aquatic biota. It highlights how increased acid input and other reactions resulting from changed pH conditions have a greater impact on freshwater ecosystems than the increased input of S and N compounds themselves. The article also summarizes the effects on various organisms, including macrophytes, periphyton, phytoplankton, and zooplankton, and the changes in their species composition and community structure due to acidification.
