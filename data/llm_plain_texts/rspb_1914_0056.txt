tldr: The author investigated the relationship between the thymus and testes growth in animals. They analyzed data from previous studies and found that there is no strong evidence to support the idea that the thymus affects testes growth. However, the data showed a clear connection between castration and thymus growth. The author concludes that further research is needed to understand the relationship between these organs.
