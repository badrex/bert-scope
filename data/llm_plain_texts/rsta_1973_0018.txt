tldr: The author investigates the analytical properties of the simple cubic lattice Green function, showing that it can be written as the square of a Heun function. Various expansions for the Green function are derived using Heun function transformation formulae, and connections between the Green function and the Lame-differential equation are established. The Green function is also evaluated as a product of two complete elliptic integrals of the first kind.
