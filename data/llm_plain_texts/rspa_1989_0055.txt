tldr: The authors calculate local three-spin correlations in the free-fermion and planar Ising models, using a method called'sum over star' identities. They find that these correlations are related to the spontaneous magnetization and can be expressed as algebraic functions of the Boltzmann weights. This research provides a better understanding of the physical properties of these models and can be applied to other exactly solved models in statistical mechanics.
