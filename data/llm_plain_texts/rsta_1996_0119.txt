  - Incoherent Imaging

tldr: The authors demonstrate the use of the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) to directly determine interface structure and bonding in electronic materials at the atomic scale. Incoherent imaging and maximum entropy analysis allow for direct structure inversion and reveal unexpected insights into grain boundary units, dislocation core structures, and impurity segregation.
