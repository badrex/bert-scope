tldr: The study investigates the sperm transfer mechanism in the monogenean gill parasite Gastrocotyle trachuri. The researchers discovered that the parasite uses a unique hypodermic impregnation method to transfer sperms, where the penis grasps and perforates the tegument of a co-copulant, and sperms are deposited in vitelline spaces or other unusual sites. This method is different from other monogeneans that use a vagina or spermatophores for sperm transfer.
