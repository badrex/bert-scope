tldr: The author examines the brains of three deep sea fish species, focusing on the diencephalon and mesencephalon structures. They compare the brain variations among the fish and discuss the adaptations that may have occurred due to their unusual environment. The study provides insights into the brain anatomy of deep sea fish and their unique adaptations for survival.
