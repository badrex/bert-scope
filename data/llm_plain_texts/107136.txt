tldr: The author examines the unique arrangement of arteries in slow-moving muscles and how it affects their function. They observe that certain muscles, such as the cremasters, intercostal, and diaphragm, have a slower and more prolonged action, and their arteries are distributed differently compared to ordinary muscles. The author also discusses the role of temperature and organs of respiration in these differences.
