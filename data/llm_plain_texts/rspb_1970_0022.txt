tldr: 'This study examines the color polymorphism and breeding behavior of Arctic Skuas on Fair Isle. The research found that the frequency of pale morphs is higher in inland and northern areas, and that there is no difference in breeding success between different mating types. The study also discovered that dark males tend to pair earlier than pale ones, giving an advantage to males carrying the allelomorph for dark color. The findings suggest that later hatching may be favored in inland and northern parts of the species range, where food is scarce earlier in the summer.'
