tldr: The author investigates the reaction of halogens with arylazoacetoacetates and related compounds. They found that the action of chlorine or bromine on these compounds causes partial substitution in the phenyl nucleus and replacement of the acetyl group by a halogen atom. The author also discovered different products depending on the reaction conditions, such as the presence of water or sodium acetate. This study provides insights into the structure and reactivity of these compounds.
