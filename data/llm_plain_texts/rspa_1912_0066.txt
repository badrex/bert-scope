tldr: 'Sir William Abney conducted experiments to study the extinction of light when the retina is stimulated by white light. He found that as the white illumination increases, the point of maximum extinction moves between S.S.N. 40 and 52. This research also showed that the white light stimulates the retina more strongly, causing the point of maximum extinction to be closer to the red end of the spectrum.'
