tldr: This study investigates the systematics in the X-ray photoelectron spectra of transition metal oxides, focusing on core level binding energies, spin-orbit splittings, and exchange splittings. The research covers a range of oxides with different oxidation states of the metal ions, revealing interesting trends and providing insights into satellite structures, final state effects, and identification of multiple oxidation states.
