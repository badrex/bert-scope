tldr: This study investigates the elasticity of the living brain and the conditions that affect its recovery after compression. The author applies mechanical pressure to the brain and measures the amount of compression and elastic recoil. The research also examines the influence of varying conditions of the vascular and respiratory systems on the brain's recovery. The findings contribute to understanding the physical properties of the brain and its response to injury.
