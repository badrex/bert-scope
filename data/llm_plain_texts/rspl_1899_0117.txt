tldr: The author conducted experiments on non-medullated nerves, specifically the olfactory nerves of pike fish, to study their electromotive phenomena. They discovered that non-medullated nerves exhibit a rapid decrease in successive effects compared to medullated nerves. The author also observed a positive after-effect in the nerves when exposed to carbon dioxide, which increased in size for several minutes.
