tldr: The author, Mr. Geoffroy, conducted experiments on the effects of dissolving various salts in water and their impact on temperature. He observed that some salts, like sal armoniac, cause a significant cooling effect, while others, like alkali lixivious salts, heat the water. The author also developed a new thermometer to measure these temperature changes and discussed the possible reasons behind these phenomena, such as the motion of particles in the water and the presence of fiery particles in some salts.
