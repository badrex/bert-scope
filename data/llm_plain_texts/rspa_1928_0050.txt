tldr: The authors conducted experiments to examine the part played by point-discharge currents, lightning discharges, and charged rain in the electrical interchange between an active thundercloud and the earth. They estimated the continuous currents produced by these phenomena and concluded that the resultant current conveys a negative charge to the earth. They also tested the so-called "intertraction" phenomenon by observing the behavior of colored albumen solution on filter paper and found that fine streamers were produced, which they attributed to the manner in which the color washed out from the filter paper.
