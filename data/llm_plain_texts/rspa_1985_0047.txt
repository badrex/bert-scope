tldr: The authors used high-resolution electron microscopy and computer-generated images to study the structure and intergrowths of ABC-6 zeolites, a family of zeolites that includes offretite, erionite, cancrinite, chabazite, sodalite, and others. They found that by de-aluminating the zeolites and using imaging techniques, they could identify and characterize the intergrowths and atomic details of these zeolites, which can aid in understanding their catalytic and adsorptive performance.
