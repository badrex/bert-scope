revised_title: 'Optimal Photosynthesis Conditions in Artificial Environments: Recycling through Higher Plants'
semantic_tags:
  - Photosynthesis

tldr: The authors discuss the potential of higher plants to maintain optimal conditions for photosynthesis in artificial environments, such as in space exploration. They explain how plants can recycle elements, absorb light energy, and regenerate water and oxygen, making them essential for creating a bioregenerative system for human survival in space.
