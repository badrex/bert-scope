tldr: The author, Peter Collinson, observes the life cycle and behavior of the May Fly, a type of ephemeropteran insect. He describes their emergence from the river, mating habits, and the process of laying eggs. He also notes their short lifespan and the various ways they die, either from predators like fish and birds or from exhaustion after laying eggs. The author emphasizes the remarkable aspects of the May Fly's life, such as their ability to survive without eating and their rapid life cycle.
