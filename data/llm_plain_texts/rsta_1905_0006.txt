tldr: The authors discuss the general theory of integration, focusing on Riemann and Darboux definitions. They explore the integration of non-continuous functions and improper integrals, considering the effects of replacing intervals with sets of points and the role of measurable sets. The authors also touch upon Lebesgue's work and its connection to their own research.
