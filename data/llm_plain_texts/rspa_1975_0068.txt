tldr: The authors present a unified mathematical treatment for thick and thin film elastohydrodynamic lubrication problems using the Ritz-Galerkin method with piecewise polynomial basis functions. They discuss the application of Newton's method and the construction of approximate solutions in one-dimensional problems, using smooth Hermit and cubic spline spaces. This approach can be applied to various types of bearings, providing a solution to the challenges of elastohydrodynamic lubrication.
