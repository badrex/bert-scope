tldr: Edward Sabine conducted experiments with Captain Kater's pendulum to determine the true vibration in a vacuum and the correct length of the seconds pendulum. He discovered that the pendulum's convertibility and the amount of air retardation were affected by the medium and the position of the weight. Sabine found that using brass tail pieces instead of wooden ones reduced the retardation caused by the air, improving the accuracy of the pendulum's measurements.
