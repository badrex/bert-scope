tldr: The study investigates the effect of actinomycin D on the development of action potentials in denervated frog slow muscle fibres. It is found that actinomycin D, which blocks RNA synthesis, prevents the formation of action potentials in slow muscle fibres when injected early after denervation. This suggests that RNA synthesis is necessary for the creation of 'Na channels' in the membrane of denervated slow muscle fibres. The results imply that a 'trophic' effect of motor axons could be due to the release of a substance that blocks the production of a protein molecule needed for 'Na channels' formation.
