tldr: The authors investigated the effect of hypothermia on the radiosensitivity of mice to whole-body X-irradiation. They found that hypothermic animals had increased survival rates after exposure to high radiation doses, suggesting that hypothermia provides protection against radiation-induced damage. The study also showed that hypothermia may offer some protection against radiation-induced sterility and cataracts.
