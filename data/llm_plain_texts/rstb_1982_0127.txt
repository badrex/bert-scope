tldr: 'This article explores the molecular biology of cell locomotion, focusing on the microfilament-membrane interaction in the brush border of intestinal epithelial cells. The study examines the microvillus filament bundle core and terminal web, identifying key actin-binding proteins and their roles in cell structure and function. These findings may lead to a new understanding of membrane-microfilament interactions and the regulation of cell movement.'
