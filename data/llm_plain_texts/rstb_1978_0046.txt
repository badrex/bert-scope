tldr: The author investigates the transcription activity in the interbands of Drosophila melanogaster using electron microscopy of polytene chromosomes. They find that many interbands contain morphological evidence for transcription and that perichromatin granules, which contain RNA, are present in these transcriptionally active interbands. This challenges the previous understanding that transcription only occurs in puffs and suggests that interband transcription may play a significant role in gene expression.
