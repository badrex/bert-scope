tldr: This article discusses the numerical analysis of partial differential equations, specifically focusing on finite-difference techniques for a harmonic mixed boundary problem with a reentrant boundary. The author outlines the proof of uniform convergence of finite-difference solutions to the exact solution and presents numerical results for a model problem. The article also suggests that a different approach, such as the finite-element method, might be more suitable for solving this type of problem.
