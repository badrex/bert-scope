tldr: This article explores the effects of tidal friction on the orbit of a satellite revolving around a tidally distorted planet. The author, G. H. Darwin, demonstrates how tidal friction causes changes in the elements of the orbit, such as the lunar period, orbit inclination, and eccentricity. Darwin also suggests that the moon was formed from the rupture of a primeval planet and that tidal friction plays a significant role in the evolution of the solar system.
