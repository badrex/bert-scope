tldr: This article presents a theoretical study of the aerodynamic sound generated by a slotted trailing edge in an airfoil or guidevane. The authors develop a singular integral equation to analyze the problem and provide closed-form solutions when the slot width is small compared to the acoustic wavelength and the chord of the flap. The theory is applied to examine the influence of the slot on noise generated by boundary-layer separation and boundary-layer turbulence in the vicinity of the slot. The results show that the presence of a slot can reduce the level of radiated noise in certain cases and significantly enhance boundary-layer noise in other cases.
