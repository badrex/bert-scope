tldr: The authors conducted research on the comparative structure of the cerebral cortex in various animals, focusing on the arrangement of cells in different layers. They discovered two distinct types of lamination: the five-laminated type with grouped ganglionic cells and the six-laminated type with solitary laminar arrangement. These findings provide insights into the differences between motor and non-motor areas of the brain.
