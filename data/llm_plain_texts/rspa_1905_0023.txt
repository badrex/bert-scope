tldr: The author developed a new type of electric furnace that can reach very high temperatures and be controlled easily. The furnace uses a "cascade" arrangement with a central conducting tube and a protecting jacket. This new furnace allows for accurate melting-point determinations and can be used in various physical investigations.
