tldr: The authors discuss the limitations of current antibiotic design and propose a more rational approach to creating bacterial inhibitors based on growth factors. They emphasize the importance of understanding the structure of the metabolite and the precise way it interacts with the bacterial enzyme. The authors suggest studying isomeric substituted metabolites to determine their inhibitory activities and deduce the nature of the combination of the metabolite and its related bacterial enzyme. This new method could lead to a more effective and targeted approach to chemotherapy.
