tldr: This article discusses the molecular biology and genetics of human prion diseases, focusing on the role of the prion protein gene and its mutations. The authors explain how these mutations can lead to inherited, sporadic, and acquired forms of prion diseases, and how understanding the genetic factors can help in diagnosing and managing these conditions. They also emphasize the importance of the abnormal isoform of the prion protein, PrPSc, in the propagation and transmission of prion diseases.
