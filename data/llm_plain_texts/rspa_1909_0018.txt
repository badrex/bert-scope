revised_title: 'Mobilities of Ions Produced by X-Rays in Gases and Vapors'
semantic_tags:
  - Ion mobility
  - X-ray physics
  - Gas ionization
  - Electric fields
  - Kinetic theory of gases
tldr: The authors measured the velocities of positive and negative ions produced by X-rays in various gases and vapors. They found that the mobility of ions generally varied inversely with pressure and that there was no direct relation between mobilities and molecular weights. The results were explained using the kinetic theory of gases, suggesting that ions consist of a single gas molecule with an associated charge.
