tldr: This article proposes a new interpretation of unimolecular reactions, suggesting that the energy of activation can be distributed among a considerable number of degrees of freedom. This idea could potentially explain the discrepancy between the number of molecules undergoing chemical change and the number of activated molecules in unimolecular reactions.
