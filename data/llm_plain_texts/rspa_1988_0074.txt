tldr: The author presents an asymptotic expansion of the Kelvin ship-wave source integral, which is important in the mathematical theory of wave resistance of ships. The expansion is valid for large values of the parameter A, while B and C are not large. This expansion offers computational advantages over numerical integration methods.
