tldr: The authors discovered a new genus of Fagaceae, Trigonobalanus, on Mount Kinabalu during the 1961 Royal Society Expedition to North Borneo. Trigonobalanus has unique leaf whorls and is significant in understanding the taxonomy of the Fagaceae family. The authors suggest that Quercus, a related genus, evolved from Trigonobalanus-like ancestors. Trigonobalanus also shares similarities with fossil species found in Baltic amber.
