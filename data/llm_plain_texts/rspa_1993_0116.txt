tldr: The author calculates the central charge from the second moment of the spin-spin correlation function in the two-dimensional Ising model. They develop high field expansions and use series extrapolation methods to estimate the central charge, which is related to the amplitude for the divergence of the spin-spin correlation function at the critical point.
