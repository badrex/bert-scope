tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the large angle scattering of electrons in various gases. They found that the elastic and inelastic scattering curves were similar, and the results clarified the interpretation of the phenomena. The experimental results provided a clue to certain theoretical difficulties, suggesting that the observed facts could be explained on simple considerations involving the "size" of the atom.
