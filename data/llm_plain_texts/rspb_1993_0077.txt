tldr: This study investigates the effects of a 15-week endurance exercise program on genetically normal and dystrophic mdx mice. The results show that exercised mdx mice had improved contractile properties and muscle function, with increased resistance to fatigue and a higher proportion of oxidative muscle fibers. The exercise program was beneficial for the mdx mice, enhancing muscle regeneration and reducing muscle fatiguability.
