tldr: The authors studied the membrane responses of smooth muscle to the iontophoretic application of acetylcholine or carbachol. They found that the latency and form of the responses varied depending on factors such as the distance between the pipette and receptors, the amount of drug released, and the position of the pipette. The results suggest that smooth muscle cell membranes may not be equally sensitive to acetylcholine or carbachol, and that the more sensitive regions may be less accessible to iontophoretically applied drugs.
