tldr: The authors conducted experiments using the Lozier apparatus to measure the attachment and ionization cross-sections in carbon monoxide. They found that the attachment cross-section for carbon monoxide is higher than previous estimates, and the ionization cross-sections in the range of 15 to 75 volts are higher than those reported earlier. The results provide insights into the behavior of carbon monoxide when exposed to low-energy electrons and contribute to understanding electron affinity values for oxygen.
