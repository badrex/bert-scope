tldr: The author analyzed the contents of the thoracic duct in a human subject after death. They found differences in the aqueous extractive and salts compared to blood. The white color of chyle is due to the presence of opake white salivary matter. Microscopic examination revealed differences in the globules of chyle compared to blood, and the osmazome content in chyle was found to be higher than in blood.
