tldr: The authors developed a channel-based model for the anterior burster neuron of the lobster stomatogastric ganglion and used bifurcation analysis to investigate the response of the model to changes in its parameters. They constructed two-dimensional maps of the parameter space, which showed how the dynamics of the model depend on variations in model parameters. The model accurately predicted the changes in neuronal voltage oscillations observed in experiments, demonstrating the efficacy of dynamical systems theory in understanding the varied oscillatory behaviors of a channel-based neural model.
