tldr: This article discusses the predictability of weather and climate using mathematical models. It highlights the importance of data coverage and data assimilation in improving forecast accuracy. The author also explores the concept of chaotic behavior in the atmosphere and its impact on predictability, concluding that the ultimate range of useful deterministic forecasts is between 2 and 3 weeks.
