tldr: The author investigates the functional morphology of hinge and ligament in Spondylus and Plicatula, two species of the Spondylidae and Plicatulidae families. They compare these structures with those of the Pectinidae family and discuss the evolutionary relationships within the superfamily Pertinacea. The study reveals significant differences in the ligament structure and raises questions about the classification of Plicatulidae as a separate superfamily.
