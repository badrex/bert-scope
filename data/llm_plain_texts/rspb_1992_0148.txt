tldr: This study investigates the structure and synaptic connectivity of geniculocortical axons in the kitten's area 17 during the post-natal development period. The researchers compared the axons in 34-day-old kittens with those in adult cats, finding differences in the frequency of synapses on spines and the presence of collateral projections in layer 1. These findings provide insights into the development of cortical circuits and the critical period for binocular vision.
