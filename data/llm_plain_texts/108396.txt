tldr: This article by William Thomson explores the mathematical theory of magnetism, focusing on the laws governing magnetic force and the distribution of magnetism in bodies. It also discusses the concept of magnets, their properties, and the effects of the earth's magnetic field on them. The author examines the directing couple experienced by a magnet due to the earth's action and introduces the magnetic axis, which determines the direction of the total terrestrial magnetic force at a given location.
