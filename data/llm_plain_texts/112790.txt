tldr: The author, Earl of Rosse, discusses the principles of constructing thermopiles with greater sensitivity and efficiency. By reducing the cross-section of the elements and minimizing the mass, the thermopile's sensibility can be increased. The author also compares different thermopile designs and materials, suggesting that further improvements can be made.
