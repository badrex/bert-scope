revised_title: 'Eukaryotic Chromosome and Chromatin Structure: An Overview of Nucleosome Organization'
semantic_tags:
  - Chromatin structure
  - Nucleosome
  - Histones
  - Chromatin organization
  - Eukaryotic chromosomes
tldr: This article discusses the structure of eukaryotic chromosomes and chromatin, focusing on the nucleosome as the basic unit of chromatin organization. Nucleosomes consist of DNA wrapped around a core of histone proteins, and their structure is essential for understanding gene organization and expression control in eukaryotic cells.
