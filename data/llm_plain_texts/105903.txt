tldr: 'William Hewson conducted experiments on blood coagulation and serum separation, discovering that the process is influenced by temperature. He found that blood coagulates and separates more efficiently in warmer conditions, and that the proportions of crassamentum and serum in the blood can indicate the health of an individual. Hewson also observed that the color of blood is affected by the presence of air and that neutral salts can prevent coagulation while still allowing for separation.'
