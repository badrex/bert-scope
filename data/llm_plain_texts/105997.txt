tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the effectiveness of pointed and blunted rods in securing buildings against lightning. The results showed that pointed rods are better at drawing off lightning, reducing the risk of damage to buildings and potential harm to people inside. This conclusion was supported by various experiments using electrometers, thunder-houses, and jars.
