tldr: The authors present a design method for the steady, full journal bearing, based on a regression analysis of thermohydrodynamic solutions. The method incorporates four main interacting regimes, including pressure generation in the oil film, temperature generation, heat conduction through bearing surfaces, and inlet mixing of hot and cool oil. This new approach offers improved accuracy and economy compared to existing design methods.
