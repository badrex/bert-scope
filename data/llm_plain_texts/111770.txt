tldr: This article discusses the structure and formation of limestone nodules found within seams of bituminous coal. The authors examine the composition and botanical characteristics of these nodules, focusing on the presence of Trigonocarpon, a type of fossil plant. The study highlights the potential importance of these nodules in understanding the conversion of plants into bituminous coal and the relationship between various plant genera.
