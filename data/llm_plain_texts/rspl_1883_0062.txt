tldr: This paper describes experiments conducted in the Cavendish Laboratory to determine the ratio between electrostatic and electromagnetic measures of the capacity of a condenser. The authors found that the ratio "v" is approximately 2.963 x 10^10 in CGS units. Additionally, the paper discusses the molecular weights of substituted ammonias and their potential to reveal the effect of small differences in atomic weights of carbon and hydrogen.
