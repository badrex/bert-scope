tldr: The study investigates the organization of corticocortical projections from area 17 to area 18 of the cat's visual cortex using retrogradely transported tracers. The results show a discontinuous, clustered distribution of labelled cells in area 17, suggesting a genuinely patchy population of cells projecting to area 18. The study also provides quantitative estimates of the extent of divergence and convergence in the projection.
