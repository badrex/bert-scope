tldr: This study examines the reactions of propene and cyclopentene with deuterium on calcium oxide using mass spectrometry, gas chromatography, and deuterium spectroscopy. The research provides evidence about the nature and reactivity of adsorbed intermediates involved in the catalytic reactions, revealing that the dominant mechanism of exchange occurs between adsorbed alkene and adsorbed-allyl species. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms of exchange and addition reactions on oxide catalysts.
