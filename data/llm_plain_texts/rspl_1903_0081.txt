tldr: The author presents a generalized theory of alternative inheritance, which is based on the pure gamete conception and is more general than Mendel's theory. The theory demonstrates broad features of inheritance that are in perfect accord with the biometric theory of inheritance in populations. The author also discusses the limitations of the Mendelian generalization when tested by actual numbers and points of theoretical divergence.
