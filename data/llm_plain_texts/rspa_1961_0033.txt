tldr: The authors studied the deuteration of various cyclic olefins on iron and other transition metal films. They found that the shape of the adsorbed cyclic species influences the patterns of products, with more highly deuterated alkanes formed at higher temperatures. The results provide insights into the mechanisms of deuteration and exchange reactions on metal surfaces.
