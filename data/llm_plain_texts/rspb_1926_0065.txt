revised_title: 'Effects of Calcium, Potassium, and Ultra-Violet Rays on Involuntary Muscles'
semantic_tags:
  - Muscle contraction
  - Calcium metabolism
  - Potassium ions
  - Ultra-violet rays
  - Frog's rectum
tldr: The article investigates the effects of calcium, potassium, and ultra-violet rays on the contraction of involuntary muscles, specifically the frog's rectum. The experiments show that ultra-violet rays have a significant impact on the contraction of involuntary muscles when calcium chloride is present in the nutritive solution. The study also demonstrates the antagonistic action between calcium and magnesium ions.
