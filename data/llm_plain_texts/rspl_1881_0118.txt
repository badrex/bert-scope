tldr: The author presents a new chemical theory of gunpowder combustion, explaining the transformation of its constituents (saltpetre, charcoal, and sulfur) into various products. They address the challenges in analyzing the composition of gunpowder and its products, and propose a method to represent the chemical metamorphosis of gunpowder by an equation. This theory helps to calculate the quantity of each product of combustion from the known composition of a given weight of powder and the amount of heat generated during its metamorphosis.
