tldr: The authors studied the oxidation of monolayers of unsaturated fatty acids, focusing on oleic, petroselinic, a(3 iso-oleic, and chaulmoogric acids. They found that the rate of oxidation increased with the surface density of the molecules, and that the accessibility of the double bonds to the oxidizing agent played a crucial role in the reaction kinetics. The results have implications for heterogeneous catalysis and reactions in bulk phases involving complex organic molecules.
