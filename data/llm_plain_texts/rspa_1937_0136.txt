tldr: The authors study the orientation and hydrolysis of long-chain ester films. They find that the orientation of the esters affects their hydrolysis rate, with some esters having a faster rate of hydrolysis than others. The authors also discover that the orientation of the esters can be altered by compression, which changes the rate of hydrolysis.
