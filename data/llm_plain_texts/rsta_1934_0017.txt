tldr: The author investigates the deformation of right circular cylinders of soft metal under variable axial load. They develop a theoretical and rational analysis using tensor calculus, considering the metal as isotropic and incompressible. The study focuses on the plastico-viscous strains and their effects on the metal's properties, providing insights into the behavior of soft metals under stress.
