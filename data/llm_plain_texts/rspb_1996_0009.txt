tldr: The author conducted hand-pollination experiments on rosebay willowherb plants to study the relationship between floral asymmetry and embryo abortion. They found that floral asymmetry in both pollen donor and recipient plants is positively related to embryo abortion rates, suggesting that both maternal and paternal plants affect embryo failure. This indicates that pollinator preferences for symmetrical flowers may contribute to selective abortion of developmentally unstable embryos in plants.
