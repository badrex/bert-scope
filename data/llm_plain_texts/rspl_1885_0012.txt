tldr: The author conducted a detailed study of the microscopical characters of the deposits in the Nile Delta, focusing on the sands and muds found in the area. They discovered that the sands consist of well-rounded grains of quartz, felspar, and other minerals, which have been formed by the breaking up of granitic and metamorphic rocks. The muds, on the other hand, contain a mixture of mineral and organic particles, with kaolin being almost absent. The study supports the conclusion that the sands are "desert-sand," derived from the vast tracts of desert on either side of the Nile Valley.
