tldr: 'The authors conducted molecular dynamics simulations of n-butane and n-hexane adsorbed in silicalite to study their diffusion properties. They found that the model used can reproduce experimentally measured values of activation energies and diffusion coefficients. The study provides insight into the microscopical behavior of the adsorbed molecules and their response to changes in loading and temperature.'
