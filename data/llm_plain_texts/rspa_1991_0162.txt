tldr: This article explores the existence of trapped modes in a circular cylindrical acoustic waveguide. The author constructs a trapped mode by using the method of multipoles and shows that a certain infinite determinant vanishes when the wavenumber is slightly less than the cut-off wavenumber, provided that the radius of the sphere is small enough. This discovery has implications for understanding wave propagation in acoustic systems.
