  - Photosynthesis
  - Chlorophyll

  - Light Absorption
  - Plant Metabolism
tldr: The author investigates the function of chlorophyll in plants and concludes that it plays a crucial role in the process of photosynthesis. Chlorophyll absorbs light energy, which is then used to convert carbon dioxide and water into carbohydrates and oxygen. The author also discusses the role of other pigments, such as xanthophyll and carotin, in the process.
