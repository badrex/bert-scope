tldr: The authors propose a new method for quantizing the new field equations, which avoids the difficulties of previous theories. They introduce a new form of the classical field equations and apply a variation principle to derive the equations of motion. The new equations are shown to be identical to the old ones in a given coordinate system but cannot be expressed in a covariant spacetime formulation. The authors then discuss the commutation rules for the fundamental variables and the natural units used in their approach.
