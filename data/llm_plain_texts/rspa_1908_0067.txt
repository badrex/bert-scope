tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the scattering of alpha particles when passing through matter. They observed a significant scattering effect, which they attributed to the particles being deflected by the positive charge in the matter. This discovery provided evidence for the nuclear model of the atom, where a small, dense nucleus contains a positive charge and is surrounded by negatively charged electrons.
