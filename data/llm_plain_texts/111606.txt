tldr: The author examines the discovery of flint implements found in undisturbed geological beds containing the remains of extinct mammals. These findings challenge the widely accepted belief that humans did not exist until after the latest geological changes and the extinction of large mammals. The author visits various sites in France, including St. Acheul, Abbeville, and Menchecourt, to investigate the presence of these tools and their relationship with the fossils. The discovery of these flint implements suggests that humans may have coexisted with extinct mammals in the past.
