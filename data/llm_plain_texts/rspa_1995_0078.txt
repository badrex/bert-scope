tldr: The authors present a first-principles variational derivation of the formula for pressure difference across a charged conducting liquid surface, starting from the laws of thermodynamics. They treat the charged liquid and its environment as a heterogeneous system in thermodynamic equilibrium and consider the effects of a small virtual variation in the shape of the conducting-liquid surface. The derivation applies to the static equilibrium situation and provides a deeper understanding of the thermodynamics of voltage sources and capacitance.
