tldr: The author, M. Somerville, conducted experiments to determine if the more refrangible solar rays could magnetize steel. They discovered that steel exposed to the violet rays of the solar spectrum became magnetic. The author found that the magnetization was more successful during specific hours of the day and that the uncovered part of the steel became a north pole. This research expanded understanding of the relationship between sunlight and magnetism.
