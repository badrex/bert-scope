tldr: The author, J. Frederic Daniell, conducts experiments on the electrolysis of secondary compounds and the nature of electrolytes. He investigates the behavior of metals and compound anions during electrolysis and suggests that inorganic oxyacid salts should be considered compounds of metals and compound anions. This research supports the hypothesis of the general analogy in the constitution of all salts, whether derived from oxyacids or hydroacids.
