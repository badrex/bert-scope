tldr: The author describes a new method for separating bismuth from copper in ores, using a dry process. By fusing the cupreous bismuth with bismuth sulphide, the copper is absorbed, and the bismuth can be recovered for commercial use. This method is faster and more efficient than previous wet processes, allowing for the treatment of larger quantities of alloy at once.
