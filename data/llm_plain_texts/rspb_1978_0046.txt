revised_title: 'Electron Capture and Paramagnetic Centers in Oxyhaemoglobin: An ESR Study'
semantic_tags:
  - Electron Spin Resonance (ESR)
  - Hemoglobin
  - Paramagnetic Centers
  - Oxygen Binding
  - Radiation Effects
tldr: The authors used Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) spectroscopy to study the effects of 60Co y rays on oxyhaemoglobin. They discovered two paramagnetic centers in the a and Î² chains, which change upon warming above 77 K. The study provides insights into the stability of oxyhaemoglobin and the formation of paramagnetic centers under radiation exposure.
