tldr: The authors studied the effect of specific catalysts, such as iron, sodium, calcium, and aluminum, on the reactions of the steam-carbon system. They found that sodium catalyzes the steam-carbon reaction, while iron and sodium catalyze the carbon dioxide-carbon reaction. The heterogeneous oxidation of carbon monoxide by steam is enhanced by all the additions except aluminum. The results provide insights into how catalysts fulfill the role assigned to them by the electronic theory of catalysis.
