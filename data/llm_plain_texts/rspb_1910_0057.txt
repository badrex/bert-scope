tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the nitrogen-fixing capabilities of certain bacteria in the soil. They found that a mixed culture of Azotobacter and Pseudomonas can increase the nitrogen content in the soil, which is beneficial for plant growth. This discovery could potentially improve agricultural practices by increasing soil fertility.
