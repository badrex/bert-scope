tldr: The author examines the medulla oblongata of various Cyprinoid fish species and discovers four distinct groups based on their brain structure. The study reveals a connection between the medulla oblongata and the feeding habits of the fish, such as surface feeding, plankton feeding, and ground feeding. The research also highlights the importance of further investigating the relationship between brain structure and fish behavior.
