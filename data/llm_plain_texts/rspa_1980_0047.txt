tldr: The authors develop an approximate theory of nematic disorder in liquid crystals, similar to the spin wave theory of ferromagnetic disorder. They apply this theory to two lattice models, one with nearest neighbor interactions and another with long-range interactions. The theory accurately predicts the magnitude of disorder and short-range order for both models at temperatures above the nematic-isotropic transition temperature. The authors also discuss the limitations of the theory and suggest further improvements.
