tldr: The authors studied the absorption spectra of acrolein vapor and found two fundamental vibrational frequencies of the excited state, 1260 cm-1 and 500 cm-1. They also discovered a unique fine structure in the acrolein spectrum, which has not been observed in other molecular spectra. The study provides insights into the electronic and vibrational properties of acrolein and its relationship to other aldehydes.
