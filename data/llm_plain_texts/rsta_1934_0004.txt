tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the magnetic anisotropy of various paramagnetic crystals, focusing on monoclinic crystals. They used different methods to measure the susceptibilities and principal magnetic axes, providing valuable information about the crystal structure and molecular orientations. Their findings help improve the understanding of atomic energy levels in crystals and contribute to the study of paramagnetic materials.
