tldr: In 1750, a powerful lightning strike hit a house in Darking, Surrey, causing significant damage. The owner, Mr. William Child, described the event in a letter to Mr. James Pitfold. The lightning entered the house through the roof, traveled through wires, and affected various objects, including splitting a bed post, melting box-irons, and igniting straw and packing paper. Fortunately, no one was hurt, and the fire was quickly extinguished.
