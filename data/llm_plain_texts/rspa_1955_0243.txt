tldr: This study investigates the effects of temperature on the plastic properties of aluminum crystals. By straining the crystals at different temperatures, the researchers found that the flow stress changes reversibly with temperature. They also discovered a significant effect of temperature on work hardening, which they explained using dislocation theory. The findings provide insights into the behavior of aluminum and its potential applications.
