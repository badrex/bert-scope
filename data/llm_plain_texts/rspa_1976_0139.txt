tldr: The article investigates the influence of anionic and cationic polyelectrolytes on electron transfer reactions of Co complexes. It shows that anionic polyelectrolytes accelerate the reactions, while cationic polyelectrolytes have a smaller effect. The results are in agreement with the Bronsted-Bjerrum-Manning theory, which explains the rate enhancement due to changes in the free energies of the reactants and the activated complex caused by polyions.
