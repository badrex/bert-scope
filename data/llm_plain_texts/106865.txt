tldr: The author describes the process of converting cast iron into malleable iron, detailing the chemical reactions and gas production involved. The study provides insights into the role of oxygen, charcoal, and the generation of heat during the conversion process. The author also discusses the role of water in the conversion and challenges the hypothesis that water is the embodying principle of all elastic fluids.
