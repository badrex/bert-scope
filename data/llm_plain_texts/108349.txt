tldr: This article presents the laws and theory of electric discharge in torpedo and other electric fishes. The author demonstrates that the electric organs of these animals are composed of numerous elementary organs, and that under nervous influence, the two opposite electricities separate and re-unite. The author also establishes a connection between the intensity of the nervous force and the electric discharge, and shows the relation between nervous influence and electricity.
