tldr: The author examines the decomposition of rubian, a natural dye, through fermentation and chemical reactions. They discover that the process involves the formation of various products, including alizarine, rubiadipine, and rubiagine. The author also investigates the effects of different substances and conditions on the fermentation process, such as acids, alkalis, and temperature, and their impact on the formation of specific products. This study provides insights into the chemistry of natural dyes and the process of fermentation.
