tldr: This study investigates how visual acuity is affected by different colours of light. The researchers found that visual acuity is much lower with shorter wavelengths, such as blue light, than with medium or long wavelengths, like red and green light. This is not due to differences in refrangibility of the rays, but may be related to the way the eye focuses different colours.
