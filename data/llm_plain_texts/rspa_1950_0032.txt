tldr: This article explores the limitations of the molecular orbital theory and introduces a higher approximation method to address configuration interaction in non-empirical methods. The author focuses on benzene and demonstrates that the new approach significantly alters the energy patterns of molecular states, emphasizing the importance of considering electron repulsion and resonance effects in molecular orbital theory.
