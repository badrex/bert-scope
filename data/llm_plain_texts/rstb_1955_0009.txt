tldr: The authors studied the breakdown of organophosphorus insecticides and related compounds in plants. They found that these compounds undergo oxidation, producing mainly unstable compounds that are later hydrolyzed into substituted phosphoric acids. The study focused on the non-ionizable metabolites, which are extracted using chloroform, and provided insight into the chemical mechanisms involved in the degradation process.
