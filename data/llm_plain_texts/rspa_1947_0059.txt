tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate the slow-neutron-produced activities of thallium and the dual disintegration of radium E. They discovered that the currently accepted assignment of activities was incorrect and provided evidence for the correctness of their conclusion through various experiments and chemical methods of separation. The study contributes to the understanding of nuclear physics and radioactivity.
