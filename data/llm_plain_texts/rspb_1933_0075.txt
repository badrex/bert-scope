tldr: Researchers studied the effects of hypophysectomy on mated estrous ferrets to understand the relationship between the pituitary gland and ovulation. They discovered that removing the pituitary gland within an hour after mating could inhibit ovulation. This finding showed that the ovulation-producing hormone is released rapidly after copulation, and the mechanism of ovulation is similar in ferrets and rabbits.
