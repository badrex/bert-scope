tldr: The author investigates the process of sugar transformation in the animal body, focusing on the role of oxygen and molecular changes in the destruction of sugar. They find that sugar is transformed into lactic acid through a process similar to fermentation, and that this transformation is influenced by the presence of other substances in the blood. The author also discusses the differences in sugar metabolism between healthy and diabetic individuals.
