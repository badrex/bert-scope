tldr: The author conducted an experiment to compare the heat transfer of warm mercury and warm water. They found that warm mercury communicated more heat than an equal bulk of water, indicating that there is more matter in the mercury. This experiment showed that bodies of the same bulk do not contain equal quantities of matter.
