tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the differential effect of synthetic plant growth substances, specifically a-naphthylacetic acid, on the germination and early growth of different plant species. They found that a-naphthylacetic acid had a significant impact on the germination and growth of yellow charlock, while oats remained unaffected. This discovery has practical importance in the development of selective weed-killers for agricultural use.
