tldr: This study investigates the sorption of methyl and ethyl alcohols by silica gels, focusing on the isothermals and hysteresis phenomena. The researchers found that one type of silica gel exhibited hysteresis, while another did not. They also discovered that the quantity of ethyl alcohol adsorbed at saturation is higher in the gel with the higher capacity. The study provides insights into the behavior of silica gels and their potential applications in adsorption processes.
