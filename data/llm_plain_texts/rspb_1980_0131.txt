tldr: This study investigates the effects of adapting fields on visual sensitivity and color perception. Researchers found that adding yellow fields to a blue field can cause a decrease in visual sensitivity, and the phenomenon of combinative euchromatopsia occurs when the observer perceives the composite field as most nearly achromatic. The results provide insights into the mechanisms of visual adaptation and color perception.
