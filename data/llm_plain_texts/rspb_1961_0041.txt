tldr: The article describes a new method called organ culture for studying the implantation of mammalian blastocysts. By adapting Shaffer's technique, researchers can successfully embed rabbit blastocysts in endometrium incubated as organized explants, allowing for more controlled conditions than in living animals. This method helps to understand the factors controlling the growth, differentiation, and activity of implanting trophoblast, which is relevant to the problem of malignant neoplasia.
