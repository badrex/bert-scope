tldr: In 1769, John Bevis observed the Transit of Venus and the subsequent Solar Eclipse from Joshua Kirby's house at Kew. He used a telescope with a magnifying power of 120 times and a stop-watch to record his observations. Bevis noted the unique appearance of Venus during the transit and the agitation of the planet's limbs. The Solar Eclipse began a few minutes before the expected time and ended precisely.
