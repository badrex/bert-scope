revised_title: Palaeomagnetic Evidence for Proterozoic Continental Development
semantic_tags:
  - Continental drift

tldr: This article discusses the palaeomagnetic record of continental drift during the Proterozoic era, focusing on North America, Africa, and Australia. The study provides evidence for the ensialic origin of Proterozoic orogens and mobile belts, and examines the assembly and movements of Precambrian cratons. The findings contribute to our understanding of the Earth's continental crust formation and evolution.
