revised_title: 'Quantitative Analysis of Nitrogen After-Glow and its Relation to Active Nitrogen'

  - Active nitrogen
  - Gas concentration
  - Temperature effects
tldr: This article examines the brightness and behavior of nitrogen gas emitting the after-glow under varied conditions of concentration and temperature. The author concludes that adding unexcited nitrogen to glowing nitrogen increases the emission, and the brightness varies as the inverse cube of the volume. The study also explores the effect of temperature on the nitrogen after-glow and the number of excited molecules emitting light compared to the total number of nitrogen molecules present.
