tldr: 'Time-resolved macromolecular crystallography allows for the study of biochemical processes in crystals. The Laue method, using synchrotron radiation, enables rapid data collection, making it possible to capture structures at reaction stages. This technique has led to the first results on enzyme intermediates and has the potential to further advance our understanding of biological macromolecules.'
