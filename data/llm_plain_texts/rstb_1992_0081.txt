tldr: The study investigates the effects of adrenergic modulation on voltage-dependent calcium currents in rat aortic smooth muscle cells. The results show that certain adrenoceptor agonists, such as noradrenaline and adrenaline, inhibit these currents, while the cells possess predominantly transient, low-threshold-activated inward calcium currents. This research provides insights into the understanding of excitation-contraction coupling in smooth muscle cells.
