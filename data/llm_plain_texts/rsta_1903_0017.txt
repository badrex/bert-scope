tldr: The author analyzes the spectrum of y Cygni, a type of star, and compares it to the chromosphere. They find that the metallic and protometallic lines have similar relative intensities in both spectra, suggesting that the temperature and electrical conditions are nearly identical. The main difference between the two is the presence of helium lines in the chromosphere, which are absent in y Cygni's spectrum. The study supports the idea that the chromosphere has a slightly higher temperature than y Cygni.
