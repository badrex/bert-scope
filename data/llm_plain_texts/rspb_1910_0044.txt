tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the transmission of sleeping sickness by tsetse flies. They discovered that the mechanical transmission of the parasite by the tsetse fly was not the primary mode of infection. Instead, the disease transmission required a developmental phase within the fly. The study found that mechanical transmission only occurred when the transfer of flies from infected to healthy animals was instantaneous, while interrupted feeding prevented the spread of the disease.
