tldr: This article investigates the generation and propagation of long waves in a rotating sea due to atmospheric disturbances. The study focuses on the effects of air-pressure gradients and wind stress on the sea surface, and how these factors lead to the development of surges. The article also explores the relationship between the time elapsed from the initial disturbance and the first maximum elevation, as well as the longitudinal and transverse velocities involved in the process.
