tldr: The author examines the evidence for the Spanish chesnut tree being indigenous to Great Britain, discussing its origins, growth patterns, and comparison with other tree species. They argue that the tree is not native to the region based on the lack of historical records, tree distribution, and differences in wood texture and weight.
