tldr: This article investigates the formation and mineralization of uranium deposits in northern Saskatchewan, focusing on the Key Lake ore bodies. The study suggests that uranium was deposited in Aphebian sediments surrounding Archaean cores, and underwent several processes such as metamorphism, weathering, and migration, leading to the formation of the ore bodies. The findings are compared with other similar deposits in the region, indicating that they likely belong to the same vein type of deposit.
