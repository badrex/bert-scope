tldr: This article discusses the radiative balance in the atmosphere and presents high-resolution spectroscopy data of minor atmospheric constituents, such as ozone and nitrous oxide. The authors analyze solar spectrograms taken at the International Scientific Station, Jungfraujoch, to study the fine structure of these molecules' bands. They also compare their findings with other studies and mention ongoing and planned observational programs.
