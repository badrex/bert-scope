tldr: This article presents a theoretical analysis of sound production in moving fluid streams, focusing on the interaction between aerodynamic sound and the flow. The authors generalize Lighthill's acoustic analogy and prove that the jet noise problem can be modeled exactly by equivalent sources near a vortex sheet. They also examine the case of a round jet and discuss the amplification of the quadrupole field when the mean jet density is much lower than that of its environment.
