tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the location of neurohypophysial osmoreceptors in the dog's brain. They used surgical techniques and traced the distribution of arterial blood to identify the regions responsible for osmotic regulation. The study concluded that the osmoreceptors are likely located in the hypothalamus, specifically in the thalamic paraventricular nucleus.
