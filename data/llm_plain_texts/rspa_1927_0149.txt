tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the ignition of electrolytic gas by direct current discharges. They investigated the influence of gas pressure, electrode materials, and gap width on the ignition process. The results showed that the rate of current increase and water-vapor concentration in the gaseous mixture affected ignition. The authors established a gas pressure-least igniting current relationship and provided insights into the design of electrodes for ignition experiments.
