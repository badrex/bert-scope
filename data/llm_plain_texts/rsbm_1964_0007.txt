tldr: This biographical memoir recounts the life of George Ridsdale Goldsbrough, a prominent mathematician and astronomer. Born in Sunderland, he overcame personal challenges to pursue a career in academia, earning degrees in mathematics and physics. Goldsbrough held various teaching and administrative positions at Armstrong College (now part of Newcastle University) and made significant contributions to the dynamical theory of tides, ocean currents, and the study of Saturn's rings. He also played a vital role in university governance and was awarded the G.B.E. for his wartime service.
