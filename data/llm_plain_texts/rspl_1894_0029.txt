tldr: The authors conducted experiments on monkeys to study the effects of unilateral lesion of the cortex cerebri on the spinal cord. They discovered that the degenerated fibers from one hemisphere descend bilaterally in the spinal cord, providing evidence against the existence of a second decussation in the cord.
