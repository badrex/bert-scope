  - Snail Anatomy
  - Pinna Anatomy
tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the retractor muscle of the snail's pharynx and the posterior adductor muscle of Pinna to study the decay of tension in these muscles following stretch. They observed and analyzed the stress relaxation in both types of muscles, providing insights into muscle physiology.
