tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the rotation of an electric discharge in gases at low pressures under a radial magnetic field. They discovered that the velocity of rotation is nearly proportional to the magnetic field and is nearly independent of the current. The findings provide insights into the behavior of electric discharges in various gases and their applications in plasma physics.
