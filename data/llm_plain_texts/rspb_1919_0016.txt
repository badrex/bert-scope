tldr: The author investigates the effects of various drugs, including alcohol, chloroform, morphine, and atropine, on the electrical conductivity of the palm of the hand, which is related to emotive phenomena. The study shows that different drugs have varying effects on the conductivity, with atropine having no significant impact on the emotive response. The author also discusses the relationship between electrical and secretory emotive manifestations, suggesting that they may be consequences of metabolic activity.
