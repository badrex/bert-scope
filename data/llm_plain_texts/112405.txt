tldr: The author, John Tyndall, investigates the formation and properties of clouds through experiments with various substances and air pressures. He discovers that the size and stability of cloud particles depend on the density of the vapour and liquid, and that aqueous vapour produces the soft and tender beauty of atmospheric clouds. Tyndall also observes the different reflective energies and textures of clouds, as well as their diffraction phenomena.
