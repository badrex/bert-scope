tldr: This article discusses the observation and analysis of transient lunar phenomena (TLP) on the Moon. It highlights the importance of amateur and professional observations in detecting TLP and the challenges in distinguishing genuine lunar events from spurious effects. The article also explores the distribution of TLP-prone areas, the correlation with mare boundaries and rille areas, and the attempts to link TLP with solar activity and lunar perigee and apogee.
