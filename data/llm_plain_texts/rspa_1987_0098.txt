tldr: This article explores the role of chaotic dynamics in population biology, particularly in interactions between prey and predators. The author argues that chaotic behavior can arise from simple density-dependent mechanisms and has significant implications for analyzing population data. The combination of population biology with population genetics can lead to a rich assortment of nonlinear phenomena, suggesting that many genetic polymorphisms may vary cyclically or chaotically.
