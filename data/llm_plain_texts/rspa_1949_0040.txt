tldr: The authors developed a method to measure the rate of interaction between atomic hydrogen and olefines using molybdenum and tungsten oxides as hydrogen atom removers. They found that alkyl radicals formed during the reaction are efficiently removed by molybdenum oxide, which allows for the separation of radical reactions from the main reaction sequence. The technique enables the calculation of collision efficiencies without measuring absolute rates or intensities, providing valuable insights into the photochemical hydrogenation of olefines.
