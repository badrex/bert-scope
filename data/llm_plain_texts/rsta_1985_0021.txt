tldr: This article discusses the nonlinear and linear thermomechanical theories of deformable rod-like bodies that account for electromagnetic effects. The authors develop a one-dimensional continuum model called a Cosserat curve and explore its applications in various scenarios, including magnetic thermoelastic rods and non-conducting rods in free space.
