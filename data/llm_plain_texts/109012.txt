tldr: The author researched Turacin, an animal pigment containing copper, found in the feathers of certain bird species called Plantain-eaters. They discovered its physical and chemical properties, including its solubility in alkaline solutions and its slight acidity. Turacin has potential applications as a delicate test for alkalies and can change color upon exposure to air and moisture, resembling chlorophyll.
