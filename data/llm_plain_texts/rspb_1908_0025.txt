tldr: This article discusses the phenomenon of post-tetanic tremor, a condition where muscles remain extended and fall more slowly after prolonged faradization. The author compares this phenomenon to Dr. Sydney Binger's observations and identifies it as an identical phenomenon. The author also mentions Professor C. Bichet's discovery of a similar tremor in the pincer muscle of the crayfish.
