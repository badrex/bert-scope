tldr: The authors conducted an experimental study on the effect of hydrostatic pressure on the diffusion of linear hydrocarbons through molten polyethylene and polypropylene. They found that the diffusion coefficient decreases under pressure and that the activation volume is not related to the size of the diffusant. The results support the reptation theory, suggesting that the rate-controlling mechanism involves cooperative rotations or crankshaft motions of both the diffusant and the matrix.
