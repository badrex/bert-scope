tldr: The authors present a simpler method for predicting laminar flow development and pressure drop in the inlet of a circular pipe. Their approach combines the integral method of Campbell and Slattery with the differential momentum equation, leading to a straightforward solution that can be expressed in closed form. This method is useful for engineering design and can be extended to fluids with varying temperature and viscosity.
