tldr: The author, J. Norman Lockyer, discusses the potential use of reflection gratings in eclipse photography. He shares his experiments using a 17,280 lines-per-inch grating and suggests that with proper equipment and technique, reflection gratings could significantly improve the quality and quantity of photographs taken during an eclipse, particularly of the solar corona.
