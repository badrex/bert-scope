tldr: The authors investigated the structure of synthetic polypeptides using polarized infra-red spectroscopy. They found that polypeptides can exist in a folded (a) and an extended (ft) configuration. The study also revealed that in the folded state, the polypeptide chain is maintained in the form of seven-membered rings by intra-molecular hydrogen bonds. The research provides insights into the orientation and structure of synthetic polypeptides, which can be useful for understanding proteins and developing new materials.
