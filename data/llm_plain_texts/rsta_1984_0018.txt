tldr: This article investigates the contributions of mantle, oceanic crust, and continental crust to magma genesis in the British Tertiary Volcanic Province. The authors find that granites contain both mantle-derived and crustal components, while basic rocks display pronounced crustal contamination. They argue that the progressive melting and "sweating out" of Lewisian acid gneiss sheets from the more refractory intermediate basement during repeated intrusion and contamination of sheet-like magma reservoirs explains the observed degrees of crustal contamination.
