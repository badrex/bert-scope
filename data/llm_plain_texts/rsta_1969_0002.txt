tldr: This article presents a semiclassical dispersion theory to describe the operation of lasers. The theory treats the radiation field classically and the atoms as effective two-state systems described quantum mechanically. The authors derive a closed set of equations linking the average electric field, polarization density, and population inversion density associated with atoms moving with different velocities. They analyze the steady-state conditions for standing and traveling wave lasers, providing a complex dispersion relation that balances gain against losses.
