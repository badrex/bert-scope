  - Surface active substances
tldr: This article explores the thermodynamics of the surfaces of solutions, focusing on surface tension and the behavior of surface-active substances. The authors develop equations to describe the surface tension of dilute solutions and discuss the effect of temperature on surface composition. They also consider the solubility of aliphatic compounds and the surface tension lowering produced by adding components to a solution.
