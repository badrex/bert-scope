tldr: The article presents an analytical approach to understanding the initial stages of liquid-drop impact against both rigid and elastic targets. The authors develop a geometrical-acoustics model and a self-similar solution to calculate the pressure in an impacting liquid drop and explore the effects of fluid motion and pressure amplitude on the problem. The study demonstrates the limitations of linear theory and numerical calculations in predicting the escape of the shock system from the contact edge and highlights the importance of considering the target's elasticity.
