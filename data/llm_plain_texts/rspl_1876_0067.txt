tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the effect of liquor potash and elevated temperature on the growth of microorganisms in sterilized urine. They found that neither liquor potash nor a temperature of 115째F to 122째F had the power to excite the generation of organisms in sterilized urine. The author also confirmed that bacteria can grow and multiply freely in unsterilized urine when exposed to a temperature of 115째F to 122째F.
