tldr: Joseph Harris improved the design of the terrestrial globe to better explain the principles of geography and astronomy. By adding two movable horary circles and dividing the brass meridian into months and days, the globe can now demonstrate the Earth's motion and the changing length of days and nights in different latitudes. This improved globe serves as a more effective teaching tool for beginners in geography and astronomy.
