tldr: This article discusses the use of rocket-borne instruments to study solar radiation at high altitudes. The authors describe various types of instruments, including photon counters, thermo-luminescent phosphors, photographic plates, and spectrographs, and summarize the principal data obtained from these experiments. The results include the detection of X-rays and the high intensity of Lyman-a emission in the solar spectrum, which contribute to understanding the radiative balance in the atmosphere.
