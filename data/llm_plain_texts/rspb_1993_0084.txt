tldr: Researchers discovered that afferent signals from the extraocular muscles of pigeons modify the vestibulo-ocular reflex, which helps stabilize the visual scene on the retina. By recording the electro-oculogram of one eye while imposing movements on the other eye during the vestibulo-ocular reflex, they found that the amplitude of eye movement decreases as the peak velocity of the imposed eye movement increases. This suggests a corrective function for the extraocular muscle afferent signals in the oculomotor control system.
