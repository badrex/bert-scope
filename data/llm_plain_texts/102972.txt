tldr: The author, Anthony van Leeuwenhoek, investigates the structure and growth of tree barks, focusing on the barks of cherry, plum, and beach trees. He observes that the bark consists of multiple thin membranes with vessels or fibers running circularly around the wood. This discovery challenges the hypothesis that the bark is produced from the wood, as the author demonstrates that the bark receives its nourishment and growth from the wood itself.
