semantic_tags:
  - Prion diseases

tldr: 'The article discusses the use of transgenic mice to study prion diseases, which are neurodegenerative disorders caused by prions. Prions are composed of an abnormal form of the prion protein, and their transmission and genetic links to mutations are explored. The author explains the potential of transgenic investigations to provide new insights into these enigmatic disorders.'
