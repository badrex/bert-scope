tldr: This study presents hydrochemical reservoir models for the Birkenes and Storgama catchments in southern Norway, focusing on acidified stream water. The models consider key processes such as water routing, sulfate adsorption-desorption, ion-exchange reactions, weathering, and a gibbsite equilibrium condition. These models help explain the acidification of stream water in these areas, attributing soil acidification and acid precipitation as significant factors. The study emphasizes the importance of understanding the complex processes in catchments to address the effects of acid precipitation on freshwater and ecosystems.
