tldr: The author analyzes the results from Kew magnetographs during the period of 1890 to 1900, discussing various phenomena in the absolute observations. They examine the relationship between sunspots and terrestrial magnetism, and explore the effects of changes in instruments, observers, and reduction methods on the magnetic data. The study provides insights into the secular changes of magnetic elements and their correlation with solar activity.
