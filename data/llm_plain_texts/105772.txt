tldr: This article discusses the menstrual parallax, which is the difference in the apparent position of the Sun and planets due to the Earth's and Moon's mutual gravitation. The author explains the impact of this phenomenon on solar and planetary observations and explores the methods used to determine its effects. The menstrual parallax is essential for understanding the accuracy of astronomical observations and calculations.
