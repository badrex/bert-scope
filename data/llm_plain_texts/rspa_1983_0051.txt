tldr: The authors studied the enhanced nuclear magnetic resonance of lanthanum phosphate, a Van Vleck paramagnet, and found that the compound exhibits an anisotropic paramagnetic shift mainly due to dipolar interactions. They also discussed the crystal field theory and the spin Hamiltonian for the compound.
