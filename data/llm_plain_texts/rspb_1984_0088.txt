tldr: The author investigates the problem of determining the structure of a scene and the motion of an observer relative to the scene from the motion of the optical image across the observer's retina. They focus on the case where all visible texture elements lie in the same plane and show that the optic flow field arising from motion relative to a visually textured plane can be characterized by eight parameters. The author demonstrates that the visual ambiguity of a moving plane can be resolved by considering the observer's linear and angular velocity, the plane's coordinate vector, and the observer's field of view.
