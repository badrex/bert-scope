tldr: The author presents a structural analysis of the Mt Isa District, focusing on the significance of the flat greenstone contact underlying the copper ore bodies at the Isa Mine. They discuss the concept of spoon faults, which flatten in depth, and their role in the reconstruction of the faulted ore bodies. The study provides insight into the sedimentary basin that originally included the Mt Isa ore bodies and suggests the existence of a concealed central part between Isa and Hilton.
