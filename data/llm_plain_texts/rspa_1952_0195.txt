tldr: The authors measured the viscosity, electrical conductivity, and density of several liquids, including boron trifluoride complexes with acetic acid and its esters, over a range of temperatures above and below their melting points. They discovered significant discontinuities in the logarithm of viscosity and conductivity plotted against the reciprocal absolute temperature. These results provide a clearer understanding of the supercooled state and its properties.
