tldr: The author, F. B. Duppa, investigated the properties of bromide of titanium and its atomic constitution. By comparing the boiling points of chlorine and bromine compounds, Duppa found that the atomic constitution of titanium and silicium were similar. This led to a proposed change in the equivalent of titanium and further research on titanium's combining relations.
