tldr: This article investigates the structure of supersonic flows of a dusty gas past a wedge, focusing on the effects of particle Reynolds number and collision types on oblique shock waves. The authors analyze the flow properties and the fully developed oblique shock wave, considering different particle collision types with the wedge. They also study the flow structure in non-equilibrium situations, providing insights into the behavior of dusty gas flows and their applications in high-speed vehicles and solid-propellant rocket exhausts.
