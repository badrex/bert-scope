tldr: This article presents a method to graphically represent stress in engineering problems using relaxation techniques. The authors demonstrate the application of this method to various examples, including a beam with a curved boundary and a rectangle with specified boundary displacements. The graphical representation of stress, whether it is a vector or tensor quantity, is achieved by finding a function that satisfies an equation with known components.
