tldr: This article explores the relationship between geomagnetism and the structure of the Earth's mantle, using seismic tomography and core-mantle interactions. The author argues that geomagnetic data can provide valuable insights into the thermal state and structure of the lower mantle and core, potentially leading to a better understanding of these regions of the Earth.
