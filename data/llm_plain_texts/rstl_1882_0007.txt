tldr: 'The author, John Tyndall, conducted experiments to study the effect of radiant heat on various gases and vapors. He discovered that gases and vapors, when transparent to light, exhibited different absorption rates for radiant heat. This research helped in understanding molecular physics and the behavior of gases in relation to heat absorption.'
