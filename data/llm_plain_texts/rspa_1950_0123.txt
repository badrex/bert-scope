  - Kinetic salt effects
  - Sucrose inversion
  - Bronsted's principle of specific interaction
  - Reaction kinetics
tldr: The authors studied the rate of sucrose inversion by strong acids and the impact of mixed strong acids or strong acids with neutral salts. They found that the experimental results can be expressed using a formula that incorporates Bronsted's principle of specific interaction. Additionally, they observed a small negative salt effect from multivalent cations, indicating that the principle of specific interaction becomes less accurate at higher ionic strengths.
