tldr: The authors explore the moments of the number of points of a lattice in a bounded set, providing formulae for the mean value of the power of the number of lattice points in a bounded, Jordan-measurable set. This work improves upon the Minkowski-Hlawka theorem and has implications for the geometry of numbers.
