tldr: The article describes an improved air-pump design by Tiberius Cavallo, which allows for greater air exhaustion and improved convenience for scientific experiments. The pump features a unique valve system and a mechanism for lifting the valve, enabling more accurate and efficient experiments. The author also provides an alternative mechanism for the lower part of the instrument, which is simpler and serves the same purpose.
