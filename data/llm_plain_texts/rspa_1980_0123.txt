tldr: This article completes the solution for the gravitational perturbations of the Kerr black hole by determining the functions and. The author uses a pair of equations to find the solutions for and, which are then used to find the remaining functions needed for the metric perturbations. The research provides a more complete understanding of the behavior of black holes and their surrounding space-time.
