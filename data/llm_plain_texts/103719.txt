tldr: The authors present a new device for measuring the depth of the sea with great accuracy and speed. The device uses a pressure gage developed by Stephen Hales, which measures the pressure at the bottom of the sea. The machine carries the gage to the bottom of the sea and then brings it back up, allowing for an accurate measurement of the depth. This method is more reliable than previous methods that relied on the time of descent and emergence of the device, as it is not affected by waves, currents, or other disturbances.
