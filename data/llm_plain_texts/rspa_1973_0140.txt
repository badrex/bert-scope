tldr: The authors describe the use of high-energy particles in conjunction with the Rutherford scattering-channelling phenomenon for surface studies. They discuss the applications and limitations of the technique, focusing on surface stoichiometry, content, and crystal surface perfection. The study involves analyzing energy spectra and determining the concentration of impurities and the ratio of constituent atoms at the surface.
