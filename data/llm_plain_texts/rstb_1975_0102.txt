tldr: This article explores the process of somatic embryogenesis and totipotency in carrot cells through plant tissue culture. The author describes the factors that control the growth and morphogenesis of these cells, including the importance of darkness and the use of an 'embryo-conditioned medium' as stimuli for early development. The article also discusses the behavior of free protoplasts from pro-embryonic units and its significance in relation to development and practical applications.
