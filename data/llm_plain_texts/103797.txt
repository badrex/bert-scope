tldr: This book, Historia Caelestis Britannica, is a three-volume work by John Flamsteed, the Royal Astronomer. It contains observations made by William Gascoigne, Crabtree, and Flamsteed himself. The first volume covers observations of the Sun, Moon, Jupiter's satellites, and fixed stars, while the second volume focuses on the distances and positions of stars and planets. The third volume includes a catalog of right ascensions, distances, and magnitudes of over 3000 stars, along with tables for determining their positions for the past 200 years. The book also features a large preface with a history of astronomical observations and descriptions of instruments used.
