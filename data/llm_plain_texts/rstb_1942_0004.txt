tldr: The author's study of the giant myelinated nerve fibers in prawns reveals that these fibers are syncitial structures formed by the fusion of many nerve cell processes. The author also describes the structure and function of the synapses in the prawn's nervous system and discusses the similarities between crustacean and annelid giant-fiber systems.
