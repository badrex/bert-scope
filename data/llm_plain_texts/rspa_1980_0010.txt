tldr: The article explores the theory of X-ray diffraction from one-dimensionally disordered 2H crystals undergoing a solid-state transformation to the 6H structure through a deformation mechanism. The authors develop a model that considers deformation faults occurring in a specific manner to statistically create the desired structure. They predict observable diffraction effects, such as reflexions with different properties, and provide expressions for the integrated intensity, peak shift, integral breadth, and asymmetry of these reflexions.
