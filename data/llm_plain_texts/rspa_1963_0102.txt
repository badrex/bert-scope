tldr: The authors studied the crystal structure and lattice vibrations of hexamethylenetetramine using X-ray diffraction and a simple lattice model. They found that the vibration amplitudes and lattice-vibration spectrum agreed well with previous experimental and theoretical studies. The temperature dependence of the atomic vibration amplitudes was also investigated, providing insights into the crystal's thermal properties.
