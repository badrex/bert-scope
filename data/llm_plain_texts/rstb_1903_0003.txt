tldr: The authors studied the pharmacology of pyraconitine and methylbenzaconine, two derivatives of aconitine, and their relationship to their chemical constitution. They found that removing the acetyl group from aconitine significantly reduces its toxicity and introduces a curare-like effect. Methylbenzaconine is more toxic and powerful than benzaconine due to the presence of a methyl group. The authors also examined the effects of these alkaloids on heart and blood pressure, finding that pyraconitine is an active reducer of blood pressure and slows the heart, while methylbenzaconine has a more toxic and powerful effect.
