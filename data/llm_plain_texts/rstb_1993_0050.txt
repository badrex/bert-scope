tldr: This article discusses the ecological costs of avian fat storage and how birds actively regulate their energetic reserves. The authors review potential costs of fat storage, such as mass-dependent metabolism, predation risk, risk of injury, foraging, and reproductive costs. They also suggest directions for future research and propose hypotheses on the consequences of costly fat storage. The findings have implications for understanding fat reserve dynamics, energy storage strategies, and life-history decisions in birds.
