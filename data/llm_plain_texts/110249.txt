tldr: The author reviews the work of Clairault, Euler, D'Alembert, and Thomas Simpson on lunar theory and presents further improvements by extending the approximations and simplifying the computations. The author's theory estimates the sun's horizontal parallax to be around 8", close to the mean of various observed values.
