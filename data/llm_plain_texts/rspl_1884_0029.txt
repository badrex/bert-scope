tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the atomic weight of cerium by preparing anhydrous cerium chloride. They found that the atomic weight of cerium is 140.3, which is higher than the previously accepted value. This discovery improved the understanding of cerium's properties and its place in the periodic table.
