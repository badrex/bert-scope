tldr: The authors studied the behavior of recoil atoms in ionic solids, specifically thoron escape from solids containing radiothorium. They found that at high temperatures, the emanating power of the solids increases over time, indicating that recoil atoms migrate to the surface and get trapped. This behavior has implications for understanding the stability of solid solutions and the fate of impurity atoms in solids at extreme dilution.
