tldr: Controlled rolling is a process that refines the structure of steel to enhance its strength and toughness. By controlling the rolling schedule and adding micro-alloying elements like Nb or Ti, the austenite structure can be refined, resulting in fine ferrite grains. This process eliminates the need for additional heat treatment and improves the steel's mechanical properties. Commercial controlled rolling practices and their limitations are discussed, along with examples of successful applications.
