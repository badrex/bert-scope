tldr: The author conducted an experiment to determine the duration of the 'plateau' of full activity during a muscle twitch. They found that the 'plateau' lasts for a shorter time than previously thought, and the state of full activity is maintained until 80 to 100 ms after the stimulus. The study provides a more precise method for measuring the duration of the 'plateau' of full activity in muscle contractions.
