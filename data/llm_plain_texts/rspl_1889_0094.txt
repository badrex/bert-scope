tldr: The author examines the cranial nerves of the torpedo, focusing on the oculonasal nerve and ganglion. They find that the oculonasus profundus nerve is represented in humans by the nasal branch of the ophthalmic division of the fifth nerve. The author also clarifies the confusion surrounding the oculonasus profundus nerve and its ganglion, suggesting the terms "oculo-nasal nerve" and "oculo-nasal ganglion" for future use. The study also describes the arrangement and distribution of other cranial nerves in the torpedo, including the trigeminus, facial complex, glossopharyngeus, and vagus complex.
