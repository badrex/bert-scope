tldr: The authors develop a three-dimensional model of a thalamic neuron using the Hodgkin-Huxley equations to study the assembly of ionic currents. They find that the model resembles previous models of bursting and thalamic neurons, and they analyze the model using state and stability diagrams to understand how ionic currents produce different firing patterns.
