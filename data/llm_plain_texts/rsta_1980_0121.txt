tldr: The author discusses the cavitational mode of failure in bainitic creep-resisting low alloy steels, which is a significant factor in cracking problems in modern power plants. Residual elements, such as carbon and phosphorus, negatively impact the ductility of these steels. Conversely, additions of high levels of elements like silicon, manganese, and sulfur are beneficial. A minimum of 0.01% boron is recommended for improving the properties of these steels.
