tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the hyperfine structure of 33 lines in the visible and near-infrared regions of the arc spectrum of xenon. They determined the hyperfine structure constants for 27 levels, including 14 previously unmeasured accurately. The study helped to improve the understanding of the hyperfine structure in the arc spectrum of xenon and its isotopes.
