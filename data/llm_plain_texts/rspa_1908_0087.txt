tldr: 'The authors studied the spectrum of scandium and its relation to solar spectra. They discovered two distinct sets of lines in the scandium arc spectrum, which behave differently in solar spectra. The enhanced lines of one set appear in the Fraunhofer spectrum, while the other set is weakened. The study indicates that most scandium absorption in the solar spectrum originates at a higher level than iron absorption. The authors also observed that flutings in the arc and arc-flame spectra do not appear when the arc is passed in an atmosphere of hydrogen, suggesting they are due to oxide of scandium.'
