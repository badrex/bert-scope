tldr: This study presents the spectral characteristics of bioluminescent marine organisms, analyzing the differences in emission spectra between various species and their potential ecological significance. The majority of species have emission maxima between 450-490 nm, with some species displaying more complex spectra with multiple peaks or shoulders. The authors discuss the potential adaptive value of these spectral differences and the influence of chemical constraints on the emission spectra.
