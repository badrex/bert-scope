tldr: This article discusses the long-term effects of oil pollution on marine populations, communities, and ecosystems. It presents case histories of studies on chronic inputs from refinery effluents, repeated spills, and North Sea oilfields. The severity of effects depends on the type, nature, and duration of the pollutant, the physical nature of the receiving environment, and its biological nature and sensitivity. Recovery of the system is usually observed after pollutant loads are reduced or removed, but subtle effects may persist for a long time.
