tldr: This article presents a method to find the explicit solutions of various types of difference equations, including Riccati's equation, by transforming them into a single canonical form. The author provides an algorism for solving the canonical equation and demonstrates how to apply it to different classes of equations. The solutions for corresponding differential equations are also discussed as particular cases.
