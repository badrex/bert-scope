tldr: The authors discovered that insect motoneurons can generate plateau potentials, which are slow, nonpropagating, regenerative events. These events can evoke action potentials that propagate along the axon of the neuron and play a role in shaping motor output in insects. Plateau potentials are calcium-dependent and can be triggered by depolarizing current injection. This finding challenges the previous belief that plateau potentials do not contribute to motor pattern generation in insects.
