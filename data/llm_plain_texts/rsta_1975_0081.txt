tldr: 'The authors conducted rocket-borne photometry in the ultraviolet region to study the Orion star. They used two calibrated photometers and recorded three channels with overlapping wavelength regions. Preliminary evaluation of the data shows fair agreement with previous measurements for wavelengths longer than 2000 A, with differences in shorter wavelengths. The results indicate an effective temperature of around 25,000 K.'
