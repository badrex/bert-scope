tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of polish on the reflection of light from the surface of Iceland spar. They used an elliptic analyzer and a quarter wave plate to measure the angle of polarization and the degree of elliptically polarized light reflected from the crystal surface. The results showed that polishing the surface of the crystal had a significant impact on the reflection of light.
