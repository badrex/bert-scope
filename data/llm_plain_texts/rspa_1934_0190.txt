tldr: The authors studied the fluorescence and absorption of nitric oxide (NO) under the action of light. They found that the -bands of NO were obtained in fluorescence when exposed to light of suitable wavelengths, indicating that NO, which is one of the products of photochemical dissociation of nitrogen and oxygen, is also excited during the process. The study provides insights into the interaction of excited molecules and their return to normal states.
