tldr: The author, Nevil Maskelyne, discusses the difficulties and improvements of using Hadley's quadrant for measuring angles, particularly in the back observation. He proposes solutions to enhance the accuracy and functionality of the instrument, such as using an additional index, adjusting the telescope, and placing silver wires within the eye-tube. These improvements would benefit navigation, especially in observing the distance of the Moon from the Sun between the first and last quarter.
