tldr: This article discusses the various inherited complement deficiencies and their clinical associations. Complement deficiencies can lead to good health or be associated with specific clinical states, such as infections with Neisseria species or immune complex diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus. The study of these deficiencies has provided insights into the role of the complement system in vivo and its importance in resistance to bacterial infections and immune complex-mediated tissue damage.
