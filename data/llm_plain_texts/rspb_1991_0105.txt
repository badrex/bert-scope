tldr: The study investigates the developmental regulation of mechanosensitive calcium channels in skeletal muscle from normal and mdx mice. The results show that channel activity is higher in mdx fibres from older mice compared to age-matched normal fibres, and the level of activity decreases during development. Channel density decreases in normal fibres, whereas it remains relatively constant in mdx fibres, suggesting that channels are down-regulated in normal but not mdx fibres during postnatal development. This may indicate an early step in the dystrophic process involving alterations in the mechanisms that regulate the expression of functional channels.
