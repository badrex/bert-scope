tldr: The authors discovered a cellulose-protein complex as a normal component of mammalian connective tissue. They found that these complexes consist of a protein-polysaccharide, with the polysaccharide fraction being indistinguishable from native cellulose arranged in a helical form around a protein template. This complex plays a significant role in the stabilization of connective tissue fibers and has implications for understanding tissue fiber degradation and fibrogenesis.
