tldr: The authors analyze a wet combustion system, a model for the combustion of wet cellulosic materials, using a generalization of Semenov thermal explosion theory. They study the behavior of the system through two ordinary differential equations and find that it exhibits a range of phenomena, such as oscillation, multistability, and homoclinic bifurcation. This model provides a qualitative understanding of the complexity of phenomena that can occur in wet combustion processes.
