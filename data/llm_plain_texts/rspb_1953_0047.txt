tldr: This study examines the relationship between carbon dioxide production and changes in lactic acid, sucrose, and keto-acid fractions in potato tubers after being exposed to anaerobic conditions. The research suggests that the observed changes are in line with the operation of the Krebs cycle in potato tissues, which could explain the transformation of lactic acid into other acids and the production of carbon dioxide.
