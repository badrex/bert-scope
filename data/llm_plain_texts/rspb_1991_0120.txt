tldr: The authors explore why not all termite species have a sterile worker caste. They find that termite species that separate their food sources from their nests are more likely to have a sterile worker caste, while those that consume their nest as food have a non-sterile worker caste. A cost-benefit model suggests that increased nest stability favors the evolution of sterile workers, and food-nest separation tends to increase nest stability.
