tldr: 'Ulf Svante von Euler was a renowned scientist who made significant contributions to the field of autopharmacology. Born in Stockholm in 1905, he was the son of Hans von Euler-Chelpin, a well-known biochemist who won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1929. Ulf von Euler conducted groundbreaking research in the field of autopharmacology, a term coined by his teacher, Sir Henry Dale. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1970 for his work on the autonomic nervous system and the release of histamine. Throughout his life, von Euler was closely associated with the Acta Physiologica Scandinavica journal, eventually succeeding Goran Liljestrand as its Editor-in-Chief.'
