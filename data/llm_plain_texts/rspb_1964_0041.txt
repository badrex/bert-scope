tldr: This study examines the cell walls of siphoneous green algae, specifically focusing on the non-cellulosic structural polysaccharide xylan. The researchers found that xylan forms microfibrils similar to cellulose and is present in various species of algae, such as Bryopsis, Caulerpa, Udotea, Halimeda, and Penicillus. The study also explores the orientation of these microfibrils and their relationship with incrusting substances in the cell walls.
