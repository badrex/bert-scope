tldr: The author recounts their work at the University of Bristol from 1930 to 1937, focusing on the development of solid state physics and the study of electron theory of metals. They discuss their collaboration with colleagues, research on alloy phases, and the significance of Hume-Rothery's electron:atom ratio in understanding the properties of metals and alloys.
