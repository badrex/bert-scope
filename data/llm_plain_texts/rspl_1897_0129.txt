tldr: This article investigates the inheritance of the cephalic index, a measure of head shape, in Indian tribes with mixed bloodlines. The author finds that the cephalic index is not more strongly inherited than stature and that the coefficients of heredity differ from those determined for stature. The results confirm Galton's law of ancestral heredity and suggest that the heredity constant 7 is not unity but has a slightly less value.
