tldr: This study examines the terrestrial vertebrate fauna of the Krakatau Islands over a century after the 1883 volcanic eruption that likely wiped out their original inhabitants. The research found that 15 species of terrestrial vertebrates have colonized the islands, with two species becoming extinct and five new species establishing breeding populations. The authors discuss the ecological changes that have shaped the development of the current fauna, including canopy closure, volcanic eruptions, and the impact of human activity on dispersal patterns.
