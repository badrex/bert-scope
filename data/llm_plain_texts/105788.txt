tldr: The author examines a unique ancient coin adorned with Punic characters and discusses its possible origins. The coin features two Punic characters, which the author suggests may be pronounced as Aleph and Koph, hinting at a connection to a notable city in either Sicily or Africa. The author also explores the possibility that the coin was struck in Agrigentum, a famous ancient city in Sicily, and suggests that the coin's globule may be an uncial mark denoting its weight or value.
