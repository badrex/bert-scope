tldr: This article discusses the evidence for Holocene sea level changes on the Great Barrier Reef, focusing on the Queensland coast. The authors present radiometrically dated evidence for sea level fluctuations and variations in the height of shorelines. They also explore possible explanations for these changes, including measurement errors, dating techniques, and misinterpretation of evidence. The study has implications for understanding coral reef response to sea level changes over time.
