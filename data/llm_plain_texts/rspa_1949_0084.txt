tldr: The author explores the molecular orbital theory of chemical valency, focusing on equivalent orbitals in molecules of known symmetry. By using group theory, the author transforms the equations satisfied by molecular orbitals, providing a connection between molecular orbital theory and localized bonds. This work applies to molecules in their ground states and helps understand the behavior of electrons in chemical reactions.
