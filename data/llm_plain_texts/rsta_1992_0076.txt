tldr: This article investigates a modified autocatalator model with a product-feedback mechanism, studying its behavior in a well-stirred system. The authors find multiple stationary states, oscillations, and traveling waves, analyzing the system's dynamics and bifurcations, including Hopf bifurcations and homoclinic orbit formation.
