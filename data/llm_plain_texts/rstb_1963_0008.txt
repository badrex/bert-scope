tldr: This study investigates the process of tissue healing in rabbit ear chambers using both light and electron microscopy. The research focuses on the formation of blood vessels, the role of endothelium, and the involvement of fibroblasts in tissue repair. The findings provide insights into the healing process and the cellular interactions during tissue regeneration.
