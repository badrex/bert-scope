tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments using the Langmuir probe technique to study electron energy distributions in various gases. They found that the energy distribution is influenced by factors such as energy gained from the electric field and lost to the gas. The results showed that the rate of energy exchange between electrons is very low, and the distribution is mainly affected by the loss of high-energy electrons to the walls and exciting/ionizing collisions. The study provides valuable insights into the discharge mechanisms in plasmas.'
