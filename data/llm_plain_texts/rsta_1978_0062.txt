tldr: The article presents a solvable eight-vertex model on an arbitrary planar lattice, which includes special cases of well-known models in statistical mechanics, such as the square, triangular, and honeycomb Ising models. The model is solvable using an appropriate ansatz, and its properties can be obtained in the thermodynamic limit.
