tldr: The article compares two models, localized-orbital and iso-conjugate-hydrocarbon, for interpreting the electronic spectra of aromatic hydrocarbons, specifically amino- and nitrobenzenes. Both models have limitations in the zero-order approximation, but they provide a useful classification of spectral bands. The localized-orbital model is better for calculating energies, while the iso-conjugate-hydrocarbon model is more suitable for molecules with partial delocalization of electrons.
