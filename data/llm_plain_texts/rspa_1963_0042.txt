tldr: The author presents a rigorous derivation of the equations of general relativity within the framework of a strictly Euclidean space and independent time. This approach allows for a clearer understanding of the theory without encountering the conceptual difficulties associated with non-Euclidean space and curved time. The author also discusses the possibility of extending this method to the two-body problem and the potential benefits for the study of general relativity.
