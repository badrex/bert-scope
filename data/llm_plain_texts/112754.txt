tldr: The author, William Spottiswoode, explores the contact of conics with surfaces, specifically focusing on principal tangent conics. He establishes a theorem that at every point of a surface, ten conics can be drawn having six-pointic contact. The paper also discusses the presence of arbitrary quantities and their role in determining the position of the plane of section.
