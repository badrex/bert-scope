tldr: The authors studied the physiological function of growth factor "V" in codehydrogenases using Haemophilus parainfluenzae as a model organism. They found that codehydrogenases are necessary for bacterial growth and are used to transfer activated hydrogen from the substrate-dehydrogenase to a hydrogen acceptor. The authors also discovered that the speed of reduction of methylene blue and oxygen uptake by bacteria is affected by the presence of codehydrogenases, and that the action of codehydrogenases on respiration and glycolysis is quantitative.
