revised_title: 'Exploring the Connection between Intramolecular Cooperativity and Ligand Binding in Allosteric Proteins'
semantic_tags:
  - Protein structure
  - Allosteric regulation
  - Ligand binding
  - Intramolecular interactions
  - Cooperative binding
tldr: The authors analyze the relationship between cooperativity in ligand binding and intramolecular cooperativity in allosteric proteins. They demonstrate the connection using the Koshland-Nemethy-Filmer model and double-mutant cycles, showing that cooperativity in ligand binding is related to cooperativity in intramolecular interactions within the protein. This connection is essential for understanding allosteric transitions and protein function.
