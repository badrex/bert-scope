tldr: The authors conducted extensive experiments and observations on the tsetse fly disease, also known as nagana, and its impact on various animals. They studied the life cycle of the hematozoon parasite and investigated the susceptibility of different species to the disease. The authors found that cats, dogs, mice, rabbits, and rats are highly susceptible to nagana, while guinea pigs and some hybrids show more resistance. They also discussed various methods of disease transmission and the factors affecting the duration of the disease.
