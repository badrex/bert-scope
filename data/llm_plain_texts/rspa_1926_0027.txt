tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the critical potentials of hydrogen in the presence of catalytic nickel and copper. They modified Gauger's method to eliminate its shortcomings and found that the effects measured were associated with the hydrogen at the catalyst surface. The work was extended to compare the effects of catalytic nickel and copper, as well as plain nickel. The authors concluded that the critical potentials reported by Gauger were subject to a correction of 0.4 volts, and that the effects observed were due to molecular hydrogen.
