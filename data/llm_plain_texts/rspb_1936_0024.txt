tldr: 'This study investigates the effect of fungal decay, specifically by Polyporus hispidus, on the mechanical properties of English ash wood. The research found that the fungus significantly reduces the timber's strength, toughness, and elasticity, causing a "brash" fracture. The findings highlight the importance of understanding and managing fungal decay in timber to maintain its structural integrity and durability.'
