tldr: This article discusses Mr. Mason's observations of the regularity of Mr. Ellicott's clock at St. Helena. He used methods such as observing occultations of stars and comparing observations with those made at the Cape of Good Hope to determine the difference in the effect of gravity at these places. The clock's regularity was found to be affected by factors like wedges getting loose and changes in temperature.
