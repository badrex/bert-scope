tldr: This article investigates the effect of quenching carbon steel on its magnetic properties and the carbide transformation. The author conducted experiments and found that quenching from above the carbide temperature did not significantly alter the magnetic properties of carbon steels. The results suggest that the carbide transformation was not suppressed by quenching, and further research is needed to explain the findings of previous studies.
