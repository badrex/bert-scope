tldr: The authors used the sound velocity method to determine the specific heat of carbon dioxide at high temperatures. They employed a modified apparatus with six frequencies and a refractory oxide tube to prevent reactions between carbon dioxide and heated carbon. The results showed that the specific heat values were 15% different from those in the International Critical Tables and close to spectroscopic data values.
