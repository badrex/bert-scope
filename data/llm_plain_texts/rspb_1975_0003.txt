tldr: This study investigates the rate of marine biodegradation of oil in relation to nutrient availability at 14°C. The research found that the rate-controlling factor was the rate of replenishment of nitrogen as nitrate or ammonia. Approximately 26% of the oil was degraded based on oxygen uptake, with the remaining portion likely consisting of soluble organic compounds. The findings suggest that a minimum of 4 parts of available nitrogen are required per milligram of oil oxidized.
