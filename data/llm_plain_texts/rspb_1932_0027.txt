tldr: 'This study investigates the factors affecting the breeding of the field mouse (\lt;italic\gt;Microtus agrestis\lt;/italic\gt;). The researchers found that the field mouse has a defined breeding season in the British Isles, lasting from March to September. They conducted experiments to determine the role of light in the breeding season and found that mice under controlled summer conditions of temperature, food, and light exposure had a higher breeding rate. The study aimed to understand the natural factors controlling the breeding season in the field mouse, which could have implications for managing rodent populations.'
