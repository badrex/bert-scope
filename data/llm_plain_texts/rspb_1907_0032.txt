tldr: The authors conducted experiments on rabbits to study the relationship between ovarian and uterine functions and their impact on reproductive health. They found that the removal of ovaries at an early age led to the arrest of development in other reproductive organs, while the removal of both ovaries and uterus caused atrophy in the uterus. The study also discussed the clinical evidence supporting the interdependence of these organs and the effects of their removal on the human body.
