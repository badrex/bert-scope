tldr: The author, B. Hutchinson, observed the dryness of the year 1788 and its effects on rainfall and crop production. Despite the significant decrease in rainfall, the crops in England experienced only a minor failure in hay and turnips. The author attributes this to the lack of extreme temperatures and the timely distribution of rainfall throughout the year, which allowed for successful crop growth and fruit production.
