tldr: 'This study investigates the air movement detection system in the spider Cupiennius salei, focusing on its nearly 1000 trichobothria. The research examines the spatial range of the trichobothrial system, undisturbed air flow around the spider, and the flow produced by a flying fly. The findings provide insight into the complex stimulus fields spiders are exposed to and the role of trichobothria in detecting air movement.'
