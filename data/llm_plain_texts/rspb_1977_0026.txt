tldr: This lecture discusses the value of protozoa in genetic research and explores unconventional heredity and cytoplasmic factors in protozoa. The author examines various examples of cytoplasmic heredity, including DNA-containing particles like endosymbionts and mitochondria, and less clearly specified cytoplasmic processes. The lecture also highlights the importance of protozoa in advancing theoretical and applied aspects of protozoology and genetics.
