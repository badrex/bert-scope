tldr: The study investigates the relationship between stress, adrenaline, and the diurnal cycle of epidermal mitotic activity in adult male mice. The results suggest that stress and adrenaline suppress epidermal mitotic activity during starvation. Adrenaline is proposed as the primary mitotic inhibitor, and its secretion is believed to be responsible for the diurnal mitotic rhythm. When mice are awake and active, they have a higher adrenaline content and lower epidermal mitotic rates, while asleep or resting, they have a reduced adrenaline content and higher epidermal mitotic rates.
