tldr: The author, Robert Were Fox, conducted experiments to understand the irregularities in the magnetic needle caused by partial warmth. He also studied the relationship between terrestrial magnetism, geological structure, and thermo-electrical currents of the Earth. Fox found that the direction of electrical currents under the Earth's surface is diversified and that the heated end of rocks gave indications of positive electricity. He concluded that electrical currents in the Earth's interior could influence terrestrial magnetism and that the Earth's diurnal changes in direction and intensity of magnetism are due to the sun's action on the surface.
