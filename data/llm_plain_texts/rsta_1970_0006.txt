tldr: The authors present a precise calculation of the normal modes of oscillation of an ocean of uniform depth bounded by two meridians of longitude. The calculation takes into account the horizontal divergence of motion, making it applicable to both barotropic and baroclinic modes of oscillation. They find new types of oscillations with concentrated energy flux near the equator and compare the calculated frequencies with asymptotic expressions derived from a recent -plane analysis. The study is relevant to understanding the possible types of oscillation in ocean basins and the response of the ocean to external forces.
