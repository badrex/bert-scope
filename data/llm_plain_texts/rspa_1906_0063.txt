tldr: The authors investigated the affinity constants of amphoteric electrolytes, specifically methyl derivatives of ortho- and meta-aminobenzoic acids. They studied the effects of introducing methyl groups on the acids' properties and found that the ortho series formed ester hydrochlorides more quickly than the meta series. The research provides insights into the chemical synthesis and properties of these compounds.
