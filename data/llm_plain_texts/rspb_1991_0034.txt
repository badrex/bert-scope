tldr: Researchers investigated how the human visual system perceives and discriminates borders with different fractal dimensions. They found that the just-detectable difference in fractal dimension decreases as the fractal dimension increases. The study also showed that observers can easily distinguish Gaussian random walk fractals from Poissonian and Cauchy ones. The findings contribute to our understanding of visual perception and the role of fractal dimensions in perceiving jaggedness.
