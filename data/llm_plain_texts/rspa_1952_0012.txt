tldr: The authors used flash photolysis to initiate the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen, using a small amount of nitrogen dioxide as a sensitizer. They studied the ignition limits, total pressure, and the pressure of nitrogen dioxide, as well as the flash photochemical decomposition of nitrogen dioxide alone. The explosive reaction is complete in a few milliseconds, and very short induction periods are found. Flash spectroscopy is used to study the development of the reactions with time, investigating the reactions of the OH radical and its absorption spectrum. The authors discuss the mechanism of the overall explosion reaction and provide a reaction scheme in accordance with the results.
