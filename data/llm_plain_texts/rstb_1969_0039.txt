tldr: The study investigates the histology and fine structure of the pre-optic nucleus and hypothalamic tracts in the European eel, Anguilla anguilla, using optical and electron microscopy. The research reveals a previously unknown level of segregation in the neurosecretory axons, forming up to five discrete tracts with distinct origins and paths. The study provides insights into the structure and function of the pre-optic neurons and their secretory processes, contributing to the understanding of the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial complex in fish.
