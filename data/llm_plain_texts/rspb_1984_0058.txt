tldr: This study investigates the fate of photosynthetically fixed carbon in light- and shade-adapted colonies of the coral Stylophora pistillata and their symbiotic zooxanthellae. The research quantifies the amount of carbon used for zooxanthellae cell growth, translocated to the coral host, and released as dissolved or particulate organic material. The findings provide insights into the mechanisms of light and shade adaptation in coral symbiosis and the potential benefits of the organic carbon released in shade environments.
