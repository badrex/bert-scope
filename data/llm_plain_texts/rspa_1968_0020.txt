tldr: 'This article discusses the use of electron spin resonance (ESR) to study reactive intermediates in enzyme chemistry, specifically focusing on xanthine oxidase. The authors explore the mechanism of action of xanthine oxidase and the various ESR signals observed during the enzyme's reaction with substrates. They also investigate the interaction between the enzyme and the substrate's hydrogen atom, providing a tentative scheme for the reaction steps.'
