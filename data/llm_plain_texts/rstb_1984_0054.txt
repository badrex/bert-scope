tldr: This study investigates the lift and power requirements for hovering insect flight by combining morphological and kinematic data with aerodynamic analyses. The research focuses on two main aerodynamic mechanisms: the quasi-steady mechanism and rotational lift mechanisms. The results suggest that most hovering animals do not rely on quasi-steady aerodynamics but use rotational lift mechanisms instead. The study also discusses the implications of these findings on the efficiency of insect flight muscles and the role of elastic energy storage.
