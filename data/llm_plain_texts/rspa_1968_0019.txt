tldr: The article discusses the applications of electron spin resonance (ESR) in studying free radicals and reactive intermediates in chemical reactions, particularly in biological systems. ESR has become a valuable tool for investigating biological one-electron or radical group transfer. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding the structure, stability, and potential biological function of radicals that might occur as biological intermediates and the need for further research in this area.
