tldr: The author, J. Norman Lockyer, discusses his research in spectrum-analysis and its connection with the solar spectrum. He explains the importance of the photographic method in studying the solar spectrum and presents a new map of the solar spectrum on a larger scale. The author also describes the instruments and methods used, such as the spectroscope, electric lamp, lenses, and the use of a diffraction grating, which enabled him to improve the accuracy of his work.
