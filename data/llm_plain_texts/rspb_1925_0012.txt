tldr: The authors conducted experiments using a heart-lung preparation to study the output of adrenaline in cerebral anemia and asphyxia. They found that the heart rate responded to the concentration of adrenaline in the blood rather than the amount of the drug passing through the coronary arteries per unit of time. The study also showed that the heart-lung preparation was sensitive to adrenaline, with the smallest effective concentration found to be about 1 in 1,400 millions. The results suggest that changes in the concentration of adrenaline in the blood can be caused by changes in the secretory activity of the gland and the degree of dilution of the suprarenal blood.
