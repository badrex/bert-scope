tldr: This article discusses the need for a uniformitarian approach to understanding the geotectonics of Proterozoic mobile belts. The authors argue that applying plate tectonic theories to well-preserved and exposed areas can provide valuable insights into the evolution of these belts. They also caution against relying on a single category of geological data, such as radiometric age dating, which can lead to misleading paradigms like the "Pan-African Orogeny" and the concept of a Proterozoic supercontinent.
