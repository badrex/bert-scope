tldr: The author conducted experiments using a light trap to study the influence of moonlight on the activity of nocturnal insects, particularly those in the family Noctuidae. They found that insect activity was generally lower during full moon nights and higher during nights with no moon or partial cloud cover. This research provides insight into the relationship between lunar cycles and insect behavior.
