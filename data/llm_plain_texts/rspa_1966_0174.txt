revised_title: A Unified Theory of Gas Flow through Capillary Tubes
semantic_tags:
  - Gas flow
  - Capillary tubes
  - Viscous flow
  - Molecular flow
  - Slip flow
tldr: The author presents a single equation for gas flow through capillary tubes, applicable to various flow regimes from molecular to viscous flow. The equation accounts for the transmission of momentum generated by the pressure gradient to the tube wall, improving upon previous theories and providing a better fit with experimental observations.
