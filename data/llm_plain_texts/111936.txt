tldr: This article discusses a major magnetic disturbance observed between August 28 and September 7, 1859, and its connection to solar activity. The disturbance affected telecommunication systems and was accompanied by auroras. The author uses magnetograph data from Kew Observatory to analyze the event and suggests a connection between magnetic disturbances, earth currents, and auroras, which may be linked to fluctuations in solar activity.
