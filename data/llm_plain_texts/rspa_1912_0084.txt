tldr: This article investigates the absorption and reflection of homogeneous particles by matter, challenging the exponential law of absorption. The authors found that the absorption of particles increases with the thickness of the matter they traverse, and they propose an alternative explanation for this phenomenon, involving the production of secondary radiation and the heterogeneity of particle beams.
