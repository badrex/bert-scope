tldr: This article discusses high-energy proton-proton scattering and the study of hadronic forces. The author explains the two mechanisms of elastic scattering: Coulomb repulsion and hadronic forces. They also mention the production of secondary particles in inelastic collisions and the role of quarks and partons in hadron structure.
