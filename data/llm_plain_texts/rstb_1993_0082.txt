tldr: 'The article describes the anatomy of conodonts, primarily known for their scattered elements of their feeding apparatuses. The discovery of specimens from the Carboniferous Granton shrimp bed of Edinburgh provides the most complete record of conodont anatomy. The soft tissue morphology of these specimens reveals that conodonts are vertebrates and have chordate affinities. The findings confirm earlier interpretations of conodonts' chordate affinities and extend our understanding of their anatomy and evolution.'
