tldr: This article presents a refinement analysis of the crystallography of the phospholipid 1,2-dilauroyl-DL-phosphatidylethanolamine and discusses its implications for lipid-lipid and lipid-protein interactions. The study provides a quantitative account of the crystal structure and molecular packing, which is essential for understanding the behavior of phospholipids in biological membranes.
