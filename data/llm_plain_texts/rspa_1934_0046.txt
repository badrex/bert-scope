tldr: The authors conducted experiments using a new high-pressure combustion chamber to study the influence of pressure on the flame spectra of hydrogen and carbonic oxide burning in oxygen. They found that increasing pressure led to a stronger continuous spectrum and reduced intensity of bands in the flame spectra. The results showed that the direct oxidation of carbonic oxide in the flame becomes more dominant with rising pressure.
