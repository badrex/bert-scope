tldr: The author investigates the spectral phenomena and discharge of sparks in water, focusing on the spectra of various metals. They observe broadened and reversed spectral lines, which they classify into different types. The study provides insights into the behavior of spectral lines in different conditions and contributes to the understanding of stellar spectroscopy.
