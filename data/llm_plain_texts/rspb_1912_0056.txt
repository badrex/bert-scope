tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of electrical currents on the growth of bacteria. They found that both alternating and direct currents can slow down bacterial growth and even cause sterilization. The effectiveness of the current depends on the electrical conductivity of the bacteria and the surrounding liquid. The authors also discovered that the orientation of bacteria in an electric field is not an indicator of whether they are alive or dead.
