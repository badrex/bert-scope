tldr: This article presents new solutions of the shallow water equations with waiting time properties, which model the evolution of an initially stationary inviscid fluid layer of non-uniform thickness. The authors show that the motion of the interfaces, where the layer thickness is zero, is governed by the local properties of the initial data, which may remain stationary for a finite non-zero time before spreading. The study reveals similarities with degenerate parabolic equations used to model viscous thin film flows in the lubrication approximation.
