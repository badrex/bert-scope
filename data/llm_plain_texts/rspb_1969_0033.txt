tldr: The article discusses the fine structure of the cytoplasm in plant cells and its relation to synthesis and secretion. It explores the organization of organelles and the movement of materials within the cell, focusing on the role of the Golgi apparatus and the cell plate in the formation of the cell wall. The study also highlights the differences between plant and animal cells and the unique features of plant tissues that make them suitable for microscopical techniques.
