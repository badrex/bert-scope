tldr: 'The author identified anthocyanins in various Himalayan flowers collected post-monsoon. They found that most of the flowers containing anthocyanins were predominantly blue, in line with the observation that alpine plants are usually blue. Nitrogenous anthocyanins were found in three species of Chenopodiales and Thymelaeales, and delphinidin derivatives in two species of Caryophyllales and Lythrales. The results support the suggestion that delphinidin is more easily methylated than cyanidin.'
