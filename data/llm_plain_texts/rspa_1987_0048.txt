tldr: This article examines the applications and limitations of the classical plasticity theory to non-radial loading paths. It investigates the experimental results from various plasticity studies and compares them with the Prandtl-Reuss incremental flow theory of plasticity and the Levy-Mises flow rule. The study shows that the theory is generally consistent with experimental observations, but discrepancies arise in the presence of initial anisotropy, creep, and the Bauschinger effect. The article establishes the extent to which the theory can be employed reliably in engineering applications, particularly in the absence of initial anisotropy and under isotropic hardening conditions.
