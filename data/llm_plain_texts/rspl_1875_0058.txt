tldr: This article discusses the placental structure in lemurs and its implications for their classification. The author examines the gravid uteri of several lemur species and concludes that their placenta is diffused and non-leciduate. This finding challenges the classification of lemurs and the theory of mammal evolution proposed by Haeckel.
