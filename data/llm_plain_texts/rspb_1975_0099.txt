tldr: The study investigates the influence of the brain hormone on blood retention and oocyte development in mosquitoes, specifically Aedes aegypti. The research confirms that the brain hormone helps retain blood in the mid-gut until oocyte development is complete. The findings contribute to understanding mosquito biology and the role of hormones in their reproductive process.
