tldr: Arthur Schuster's study investigates the lunar and solar periodicities of earthquakes, analyzing the frequency and distribution of earthquakes in relation to the moon's position. Schuster uses Fourier analysis to calculate the probability and expectancy of earthquakes occurring within specific time intervals. Although the study does not definitively prove the influence of lunar and solar cycles on earthquakes, it highlights the importance of further research into the relationship between these factors.
