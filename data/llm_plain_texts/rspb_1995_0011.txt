tldr: 'This study investigates the dynamics of binocular rivalry, a phenomenon where non-matching stimuli presented to each eye cause visual oscillations. The authors collected psychophysical data and conducted nonlinear analysis to determine whether the variability in dominance durations is due to a stochastic process or deterministic chaos. The results show that the data does not exhibit the characteristics of a chaotic system, suggesting that chaos is not a major factor in binocular rivalry.'
