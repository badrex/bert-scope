tldr: The authors developed a numerical model to study the vortex shedding and lift forces on circular cylinders. They represented the shear layers around the cylinder as individual vortices, which move under the influence of the flow. The model helps in understanding the frequency and magnitude of the lift forces on the cylinder, and can be applied to other bluff bodies as well.
