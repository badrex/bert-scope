tldr: The authors conducted compression tests on titanium dioxide single crystals to study their plastic deformation and slip systems. They found that deformation is always by slip on the systems {101}<101> and {110}<001>, with the former being more active. The Burgers vector of a dislocation gliding on a {101}<101> system is proposed to be a0c, and pairs of partial dislocations are separated by stacking faults. The effect of temperature, oxygen pressure, and composition on the yield stress and rate of work hardening was also examined.
