tldr: The study investigates the relationship between zooxanthellae and their nudibranch host, Pteraeolidia ianthina, focusing on the contribution of zooxanthellae to the animal's respiration. It shows that high-density zooxanthellae populations can supply a significant portion of the animal's respiratory carbon demand, while low-density populations do not have excess organic carbon available for host respiration. This demonstrates that the metabolic relationship between zooxanthellae and their invertebrate hosts can change during the establishment of a symbiotic association.
