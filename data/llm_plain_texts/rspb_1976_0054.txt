tldr: The study investigates the rosette inhibition test in pregnant mice, finding evidence of immunosuppression. The researchers discovered that spleen lymphocytes in pregnant mice are immunosuppressed as early as 4 hours after fertilization, with this state lasting for 13-15 days before returning to normal 4-6 days before full term. The immunosuppressive factor was found to be stable when heated at 56°C but not at 72°C, and was non-dialysable.
