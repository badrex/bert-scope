tldr: This article explores the absorption spectra of long-chain ketones in the solid state, focusing on the torsional vibrations and their interaction with intermolecular forces. The author calculates the patterns of absorption lines for these vibrations and discusses the differences between symmetric and asymmetric ketones, as well as the effect of the ketone group on the absorption intensity.
