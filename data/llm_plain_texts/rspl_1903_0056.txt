tldr: The author examines the ultra-violet spectrum of radium using a five-prism quartz spectrograph and discovers discrepancies in previous observations. By using high-purity radium and accurate iron lines as standards, the author calculates the wave-lengths of the lines with improved accuracy. This research helps to establish a better understanding of radium's properties and its applications in spectroscopy.
