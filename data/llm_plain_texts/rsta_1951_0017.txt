tldr: The authors conducted experiments in five mines in northern England to study the variation of the main geomagnetic field with depth. Their measurements provided evidence in favor of the core theory, which attributes the geomagnetic field to deep-seated phenomena within the Earth. The results help test different theories about the origin of the Earth's magnetic field and contribute to the understanding of the Earth's core.
