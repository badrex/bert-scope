tldr: This study investigates the biogenesis of the cyanellae in Cyanophora paradoxa, focusing on the synthesis of cyanellar polypeptides. The researchers used transcriptional and translational inhibitors to determine the sites of synthesis for various polypeptides. They found that about 70% of the proteins in the soluble fraction are synthesized in the host cytoplasm, while 70% of the thylakoid proteins are synthesized within the cyanellae. This research provides insights into the complex relationship between the nuclear-organellar and chloroplast genetic systems in plants and algae.
