tldr: This article discusses the challenges and methods for measuring the viscosity of glass. The authors present two types of apparatus for measuring viscosities between 10^6 and 10^4 C.G.S. units or poises, and describe the temperature viscosity curves of thirteen different glasses. They also explore alternative methods for measuring lower viscosities using materials like "reactol" and china-clay.
