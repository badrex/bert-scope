tldr: The author, James Dodson, investigates the value of annuities for life and the probability of survivorship between two individuals of given ages. He presents a method to calculate these values without using fluxions, providing a new approach to understanding annuities secured by land. Dodson also explains how to calculate the probabilities of survivorship using his method.
