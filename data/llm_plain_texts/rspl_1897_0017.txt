revised_title: 'Investigations on Cathode Rays and Their Effects on Carbon'
semantic_tags:
  - Cathode rays

  - Electromagnetic radiation
tldr: The author conducted experiments with cathode rays using vacuum tubes and electric-light carbon. They discovered that when powerful cathode rays hit the surface of carbon, a luminescent spot appears, and the carbon gradually heats up. The author also observed that the divergent and convergent cones of cathode rays act as if they were hollow, which was a previously unnoted phenomenon.
