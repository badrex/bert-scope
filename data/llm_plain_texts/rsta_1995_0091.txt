tldr: This article presents an overview of the autonomous chaotic electronic circuit called Chua's oscillator and its potential applications. It discusses various types of chaotic behavior, such as homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits, routes to chaos, period-adding bifurcations, coexistence of attractors, and chaos-chaos intermittency. The significance of Chua's oscillator for studying general dynamical systems is also discussed.
