tldr: The author conducted experiments on the fluorescence and resonance radiation of sodium vapour. They discovered that the resonance radiation becomes invisible when the sodium vapour is diluted and observed through another exhausted bulb. The author also studied the effects of magnetic fields on the resonance radiation, finding that the intensity of the radiation changes with the strength of the magnetic field. These findings contribute to the understanding of the behavior of light and its interaction with matter.
