tldr: The article discusses the reflection of radio waves from a stratified ionosphere with weak irregularities. The authors examine the scattered wave-field produced by these irregularities and find that they do not have a significant effect on the reflection level. The study also shows that resonance effects suggested by Herlofson (1951) would be diminished by collisional damping of ionospheric electrons.
