tldr: 'In 1794, while constructing the Huddersfield Canal, workers discovered peculiar balls of limestone mixed with pyrites. These balls were found in a fault or break in the strata filled with shale and softer earth. The limestone balls were used for cement, and their unique form suggested they were formed from a more fluid state while revolving. The author speculates that the base of the nearby hills may be limestone, and the balls were likely thrown into the fault from a mass beneath by volcanic activity.'
