tldr: The author, J. J. Sylvester, announces the extension of Newton's Rule for discovering imaginary roots to equations of higher degrees. He has successfully demonstrated the method for equations up to the 6th degree and plans to present a complete and universal proof in the future. The new method involves the application of the principle of variation of constants and the theorem of real roots. Sylvester believes he has followed the path Newton took to arrive at his conclusions.
