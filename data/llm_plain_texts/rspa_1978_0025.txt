tldr: The article presents a thermodynamic treatment of rotationally-symmetric fluid bodies in a gravitational field, such as pendent and sessile drops, captive and emergent bubbles, and holms. The study provides expressions for the equilibrium of a system and discusses the conditions for the onset of instabilities, which is important for experimental uses of these systems in determining interfacial tension. The analysis reveals the distinction between absolute and excess applied force on mechanically raising solids and the detection of instabilities depends on a distinction between stress-controlled and strain-controlled mechanical manipulation of an experimental system.
