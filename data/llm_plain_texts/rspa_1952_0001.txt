tldr: "The study investigates the rates of evaporation from different faces of rhombic sulphur and their properties. The evaporation pressures of four faces were measured, revealing that each face has a characteristic, reproducible evaporation pressure. The activation energy for evaporation also varies, increasing with the reticular density of the face. The research provides insights into the individual properties of crystal faces and their growth rates."
