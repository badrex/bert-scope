tldr: The authors study the fluid flow and surface shear viscosity in the rotating ring problem, where a ring makes contact with a liquid surface and rotates with a steady angular velocity. They provide a formal solution for the velocity field and discuss the implications for the experimental determination of absolute surface shear viscosity, showing that surface Covett viscometers with rotating rings are more suitable for interpreting results.
