tldr: The author presents a comprehensive study of analytical operations, including linear operations, finite differences, and differential coefficients. They explain the properties and relations between these operations and provide examples of their applications. The author also discusses the composition of polynomial linear operations and the expansion of functions using finite differences and differential coefficients, which are known as Taylor's theorems. This work contributes to the understanding of mathematical operations and their applications in various fields.
