tldr: The author examines the structure and relationships of Palaeodiscus and Agelacrinus, two genera of Echinodermata, by studying their fossils and comparing them to other Echinoid species. They find that Palaeodiscus has a more primitive and ancestral structure than previously thought, with unique features such as a double series of plates in the ambulacra and a different arrangement of interambulacral plates. This research contributes to the understanding of the evolution and relationships within the Echinoid group.
