tldr: Dr. Bohadsch's treatise explores the effects of electricity on various substances, including liquids, solids, and animals. He found that electricity increases the natural evaporation of liquids and transpiration of animals. Additionally, he discusses the potential medical applications of electricity, particularly in treating hemiplegia, a type of paralysis. However, more research and case studies are needed to fully understand the effectiveness of electricity in treating this condition.
