tldr: The authors conducted a group-theoretical analysis to study the effect of mixing α- and β-orbitals on the Fermi surface in the LCAO model for graphite. They found that the common energy of the 2nd and 3rd bands on the triad axes is constant, and the Fermi surface is located close to these axes. The overlap of the 2nd and 3rd bands is about three times larger than the overlap found in earlier calculations, which affects the shape of the Fermi surface.
