tldr: The authors conducted experiments with 4-aminostilbene and its derivatives to study their growth-inhibitory and carcinogenic properties. They found that these compounds significantly inhibited the growth of the Walker rat carcinoma 256 and induced tumors in rats. The study suggests that the growth-inhibitory activity and carcinogenicity of these compounds are related to their chemical structure, particularly the presence of a basic substituent and an ethylene bridge.
