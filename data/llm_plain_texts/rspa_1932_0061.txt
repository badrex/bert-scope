tldr: The author presents a theory on the transport of vorticity and heat through fluids in turbulent motion. They compare this theory with Prandtl's theory of momentum transport and discuss the implications of each theory using experimental data from Schlichting's work on the wake behind a heated obstacle in a stream of wind.
