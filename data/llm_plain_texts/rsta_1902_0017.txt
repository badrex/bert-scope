tldr: This article investigates the laws governing the velocity of chemical reactions and chemical equilibrium when caused by the introduction of light energy into the system. The author conducts experiments using a reaction between chlorine and carbon monoxide, which occurs only in light, to study the effects of light on chemical dynamics and equilibrium. The results are analyzed and discussed in terms of thermodynamics and the intrinsic properties of matter.
