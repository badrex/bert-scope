semantic_tags:
  - Electrochemistry
  - Hydrogen electrode
  - Overvoltage
  - Adsorption
  - Activation energy
tldr: This article explores the processes of hydrogen ion neutralization and the formation of adsorbed hydrogen atoms at the electrode. The authors propose a scheme that includes both irreversible and reversible electrodes, discussing the activation energy and potential differences required for these processes. They also analyze the conditions for reversibility and provide estimates for the activation energy of nickel electrodes.
