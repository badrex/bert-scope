tldr: The authors studied the influence of different diets on the nitrogenous components passing through the duodenum and lower ileum of sheep. They found that when sheep consume a low-nitrogen diet, more total nitrogen and amino nitrogen pass to the duodenum than the amount consumed daily. Conversely, when sheep eat high-nitrogen diets, less total nitrogen and amino nitrogen pass to the duodenum. The disparity between the total nitrogen and amino nitrogen content of the diets is mostly resolved by the time the alimentary contents reach the terminal part of the ileum.
