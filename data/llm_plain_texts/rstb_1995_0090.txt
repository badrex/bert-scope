tldr: This article explores the relationship between genealogies and geography in population genetics. It discusses the close connection between the classical theory of identity by descent and genealogical structure, and develops a diffusion approximation to describe how lines of descent coalesce in spatially structured populations. The authors also highlight the importance of considering long-term population history when analyzing genealogies and suggest ways to infer this history from concordance between genealogies across loci.
