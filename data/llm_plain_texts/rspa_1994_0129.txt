tldr: The authors present an exact calculation of the transfer function for a nonlinear Fabry-Perot resonator, which is a device that can switch between two output intensity levels. They also provide simple approximate expressions of various orders of accuracy. The lowest order approximation is identical to the result obtained from the slowly varying envelope approximation, and the higher order approximations provide improved estimations in regimes of short wavelengths and high intensities.
