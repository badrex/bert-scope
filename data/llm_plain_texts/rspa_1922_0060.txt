tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of temperature on friction and boundary lubrication. They found that the friction of clean surfaces, such as quartz, steel, and bismuth, is independent of temperature. When lubricants were used, the friction was either constant or showed a discontinuity at the melting point of the lubricant. The results suggest that the friction of lubricated surfaces is mainly determined by the attraction field of the solid surfaces and the properties of the lubricant films.
