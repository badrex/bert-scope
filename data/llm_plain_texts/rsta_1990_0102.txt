tldr: This article investigates the chaotic behavior in stick-slip vibrations, which are self-sustained oscillations caused by dry friction. The authors explore two discrete and two continuous models of stick-slip systems, demonstrating their rich bifurcational and chaotic behavior. They also discuss the challenges in analyzing these non-smooth systems and the importance of distinguishing chaotic phenomena from noise in measurements.
