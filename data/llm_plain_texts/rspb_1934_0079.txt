tldr: This study investigates the effect of salts on cell permeability in milk secretion using different breeds of cows. The research confirms the correlation between the ratio of sodium to diffusible calcium in blood and the ratio of solids-not-fat to fat in milk, which may play a significant role in the differences in milk composition among various breeds. The findings emphasize the importance of further investigation into the fundamental permeability relationships involved in milk formation.
