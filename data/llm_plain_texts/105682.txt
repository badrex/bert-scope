tldr: 'Samuel Dunn observed the Solar Eclipse of October 16, 1762, using a six-foot Newtonian reflector telescope. He noted the contact between the Moon's limb and a solar spot, and concluded that the contact could not have been judged by different observers without a difference of at least 5 seconds of time. This observation confirmed his opinion about the internal contact of Venus with the Sun's limb in 1761.'
