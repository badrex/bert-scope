tldr: The article discusses the development of large-sized short-scaled disturbances in boundary layers, focusing on the nonlinear properties of the triple-deck problem. It explores the behavior of high-frequency disturbances and their transition from a Tollmien-Schlichting state to a fully nonlinear stage governed by the Benjamin-Ono equation. The study also highlights the relevance of these disturbances to practical applications and the need to consider three-dimensional disturbances.
