tldr: The author witnessed and described a remarkable Aurora Borealis event in Montreal on August 13, 1849. The phenomenon was characterized by a milky-white, compact belt of light forming a magnificent arch in the sky. The author observed that the dark cloud may have served as a conductor, feeding the zone and drawing off the matter of the aurora from the north. No prismatic tints were visible during this event.
