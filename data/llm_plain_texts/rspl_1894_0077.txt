tldr: This paper presents the results of experiments and measurements conducted on the magnetic properties of iron. The authors investigate the energy dissipation in transformers, the effect of air gaps in magnetic circuits, and the relationship between hysteresis and magnetic induction. They also explore the impact of increased frequency of cyclic variation of magnetism on energy dissipation. The study provides valuable data on the magnetic qualities of different types of iron used in transformers.
