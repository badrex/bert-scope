tldr: 'The author describes a submarine forest of decayed trees and plants found off the East Coast of England. These islets, composed mainly of tree trunks, branches, and roots, were visible during low tides. The trees, including birch, fir, and oak, were found to be well-preserved, with some even having sound timber suitable for use. The author suggests that these islets are part of a larger subterranean stratum of decayed vegetation found throughout the region, which has been exposed due to changes in sea levels.'
