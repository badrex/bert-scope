tldr: This article investigates the spectra of flames resulting from the open-heart and Bessemer steel processes. The authors identify various elements in the flames, including rubidium, cesium, calcium, copper, silver, and gallium, through spectroscopic analysis. The study provides insights into the chemistry of the steelmaking process but does not offer a method to determine the optimal time to stop the "blow" in the process.
