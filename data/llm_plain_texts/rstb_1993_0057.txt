tldr: The article explores the evolution of female mating preferences and signal diversification in the context of sexual selection. It discusses three hypotheses for preference evolution: good genes, runaway sexual selection, and sensory exploitation. The authors analyze the evolution of calls and call preferences in a group of frogs, supporting the sensory exploitation hypothesis, which suggests that males evolve traits that match pre-existing biases in the female's sensory system. The study highlights the importance of understanding preference evolution at multiple levels of analysis to better comprehend signal evolution under sexual selection.
