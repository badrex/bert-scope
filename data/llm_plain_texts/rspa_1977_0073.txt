revised_title: Angular Momentum in General Relativity: Definition and Asymptotic Behavior
semantic_tags:
  - General Relativity
  - Angular Momentum
  - Spin Coefficients
  - Black Holes
  - Kerr Metric
tldr: This article investigates angular momentum in axisymmetric space-times and provides a general definition suitable for asymptotically flat spaces. The author focuses on the asymptotic behavior of the definition at infinity and derives a conservation law. The study is essential for understanding rotating black holes and their properties.
