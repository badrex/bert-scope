tldr: The authors investigated the influence of magnetic fields on the thermal conductivity of various metals at low temperatures. They found that the thermal resistance of metals increases in the presence of a magnetic field, with the effect being more pronounced in transverse fields. The results have implications for understanding the behavior of metals in high magnetic fields and could lead to potential applications in thermometry and magnetic cooling.
