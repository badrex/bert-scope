tldr: The authors conducted experiments on cats to study the rate at which chloroform is eliminated from the blood during anaesthesia. They found that the rate of elimination is crucial in understanding the dangers and effectiveness of chloroform as an anaesthetic agent. The study provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of anaesthesia and the potential risks associated with using chloroform.
