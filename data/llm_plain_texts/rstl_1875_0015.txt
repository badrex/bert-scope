tldr: The author analyzes a series of anemograms taken at the Armagh Observatory from 1857 to 1863, studying wind patterns and their relation to time, temperature, and pressure. They discuss the irregularity of air currents and the challenges of predicting wind behavior, while also considering the influence of solar action, heat, and other factors on wind patterns.
