tldr: 'The author, W. Thomson, conducted research on thermo-electricity and discovered that electricity passing through a circuit of two metals, copper and iron, causes the absorption or evolution of heat depending on the temperature of the metals. This phenomenon is known as the Peltier effect. Thomson also established that vitreous and resinous electricity carry heat with them in unequally heated conductors, leading to further investigations on the specific heats of electricity in metals.'
