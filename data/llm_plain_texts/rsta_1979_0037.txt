tldr: This article examines the geochemical cycle of uranium and its implications for Earth's mantle and crust. The authors discuss the distribution of uranium in the Earth, considering factors such as new crust formation, subduction zones, and erosion. They also explore the potential for sediment subduction and the return of uranium to the mantle. The study highlights the importance of understanding the geochemical cycle of uranium for global heat production and resource estimation.
