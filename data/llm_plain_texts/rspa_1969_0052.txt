tldr: The authors present a path integral approach to calculate the density of states in disordered systems using cumulant expansions. They apply this method to a one-dimensional model and a three-dimensional screened Coulomb potential, demonstrating its effectiveness in calculating the density of states and providing insights into the behavior of disordered systems.
