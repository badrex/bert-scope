tldr: This collection of tracts by Robert Boyle includes a dialogue about the nature of cold, experiments on the saltiness of the sea, and the development of a statical hygroscope. The author discusses the causes of cold, the role of salt in the sea, and the usefulness of hygroscopes in measuring moisture in the air. The tracts also touch upon the growth of plants in underwater regions, the state of the air, and the principles of mathematics.
