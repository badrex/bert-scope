tldr: The authors propose that the geometrical arrangement of atoms in metallic crystal structures is determined by the hybrids of available orbitals, which can be related to the position of the element in the Periodic Table. They suggest that the metallic bond has more directional properties than previously assumed, and that this can be correlated with the known electron characteristics of transition metals. The study focuses on the crystal structures of transition metals, including face-centered cubic, body-centered cubic, and close-packed hexagonal structures, and explains the differences between the crystal structures of elements in different groups of the Periodic Table.
