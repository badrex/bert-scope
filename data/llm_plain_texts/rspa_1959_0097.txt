tldr: The authors analyzed the fluorescence spectrum of neodymium chloride and found that the interaction between the neodymium ion and its surroundings in the trichloride lattice is much less than in the ethyl sulphates. They used crystal field theory to calculate the energy level splittings and compared their results with experimental data. The study provides a better understanding of the spectroscopic properties of rare-earth ions in crystal lattices.
