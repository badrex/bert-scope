tldr: The authors studied the effect of neutron recoil on the angular correlation in a polycrystalline Hf (IV) benzoyl-phenyl-hydroxylamine complex. They found that the recoil process does not lead to a randomization of recoil sites and suggested the formation of at least three chemical species in the irradiated complex. The study provides insights into the influence of lattice imperfections and the potential impact of recoil fragments on the overall anisotropy.
