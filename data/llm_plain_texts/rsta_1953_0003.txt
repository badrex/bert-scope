tldr: This article explores the representation of analytic functions by infinite series, focusing on the conditions under which a given set of functions can be represented by their basic series. The study includes the use of topological methods and the concept of convergence in vector spaces. The results apply to various cases, including those not previously considered, and provide insights into the uniqueness of representations and the generalization of existing theories.
