tldr: The article investigates the process of phenolic hardening in the newly formed cuticle of Crustacea Decapoda. It examines the chemical composition and structure of the cuticle, revealing that while calcification is the primary cause of hardening, phenolic tanning also occurs. The study establishes a clear homology between the crustacean and insect cuticles and suggests that the changes in the new cuticle limit its permeability.
