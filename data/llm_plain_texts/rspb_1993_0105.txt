tldr: This study investigates the cost of mating in female Drosophila melanogaster by examining the effects of spermless males on female longevity and reproductive success. The results show that there is a cost associated with mating spermless males, suggesting a potential cost of receiving accessory fluid. However, it was not possible to distinguish this possibility from other explanations, such as female injury during mating or the transfer of parasites.
