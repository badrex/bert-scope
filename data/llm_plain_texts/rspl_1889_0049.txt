tldr: The author, J. Norman Lockyer, discusses further observations of sunspots and their spectra, analyzing the variability in condensing swarms of meteorites. The study supports the conclusion that as the sun moves from a minimum to maximum sunspot cycle, the lines of chemical elements in the most widened regions are replaced by unknown lines. The observations were made by Messrs. Fowler and Taylor, and reduced and mapped by Messrs. Coppen and Porter.
