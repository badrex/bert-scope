tldr: The authors study the fluorescence spectra of various polycyclic hydrocarbons and analyze the potential energy of dimers in their excited and ground states. They discuss factors that inhibit excimer formation, such as chemical combination, steric hindrance, and weak interactions. The study provides insights into the behavior of compounds that exhibit excimer fluorescence in concentrated solutions.
