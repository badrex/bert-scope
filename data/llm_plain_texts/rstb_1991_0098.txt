tldr: This study investigates the extent of long-range afferent fibers in the rat spinal cord, focusing on the caudal penetration of primary afferent axons from the T12 and L1 dorsal roots and sural nerve. The results show that many of these fibers extend far beyond the region predicted by physiological studies, with implications for understanding the development of functional connections under conditions of disease or denervation.
