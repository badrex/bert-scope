tldr: 'This study investigates the kinetics of calcium carbonate hexahydrate decomposition. The authors use experimental methods to determine the rate of propagation of the chemical change and the temperature coefficient of the rate. They suggest a kinetic mechanism involving vibration frequency in the interface between the two solid phases and the distribution of energy among vibrating ions.'
