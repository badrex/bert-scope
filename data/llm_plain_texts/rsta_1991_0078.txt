tldr: The article presents the results from the Large Electron Positron Collider at CERN, focusing on the precise measurements of the mass and width of the Z boson. The data collected during 1989 and 1990 are analyzed, and the findings are in excellent agreement with the predictions of the Standard Model of particle physics. The research helps to test the electroweak theory with great sensitivity and supports the existence of just three generations of light neutrinos, in line with the minimal Standard Model.
