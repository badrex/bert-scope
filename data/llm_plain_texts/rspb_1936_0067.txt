tldr: The author investigates the external mechanics of chromosomes in Fritillaria species, focusing on abnormal mitosis and meiosis. They observe differences in chromosome behavior and viability in pollen grains, which can be influenced by genetic factors and environmental conditions. The study provides insights into the balance and development of pollen grains and the factors affecting their viability.
