tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the latency of contraction in various skeletal muscles of different animals, including frogs, toads, tortoises, small mammals, and birds. They found that the latencies for different muscles of the same animal had a proportional relationship, but the relationship between different animals was not consistent. The authors also observed that the more pronounced latency differences were found in the muscles of the extremities, which they attributed to the different motor requirements of each animal.
