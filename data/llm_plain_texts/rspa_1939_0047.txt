tldr: This study investigates the anomalous viscosity of dilute suspensions of rigid anisometric particles, focusing on the interaction between particles and the liquid phase. The research explores the relationship between the rate of shear and the overall viscosity coefficient, finding that the phenomenon of viscous anomaly can occur in very dilute systems. The findings challenge existing theoretical equations and suggest that the measured viscosity is not a simple property of the suspension but is also a function of the method and rate of shear used in its measurement.
