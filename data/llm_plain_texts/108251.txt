tldr: The author investigates the non-vascular nature and unique mode of organization and nutrition of certain animal tissues, such as articular cartilage, fibro-cartilage, cornea, crystalline lens, and epidermoid appendages. They demonstrate that these tissues are nourished without the presence of blood vessels and propose that cells within these tissues play a vital role in the circulation and modification of nutrient fluids.
