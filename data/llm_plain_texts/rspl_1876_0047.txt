tldr: The author investigates the mycelium-like structures found in smallpox of sheep and concludes that they are not due to a fungal growth, but rather a result of coagulation of albuminous or related material. The author also notes similarities between these structures and blood plasma, and plans to further investigate the conditions that cause these fungus-like appearances.
