tldr: This lecture discusses the physics and chemistry of nervous conduction, focusing on the role of ions and metabolism in generating electrical changes in nerve fibers. The author explains how the nervous system signals information by varying the frequency of impulses and the number or type of fibers in action, rather than by the size or shape of individual messages. The lecture also explores the mechanism of action potentials, the source of energy for ionic pumps, and the role of phosphate compounds in linking biochemical and physiological events in living cells.
