tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the duration of luminosity in electric discharges through various gases and vapors. They discovered that the luminous particles in the gas stream are negatively electrified and can be deflected by an electrostatic field. The experiments showed that both negatively and positively charged particles can carry luminosity, and the number of positive particles increases with lower pressure. The findings challenge the idea that light is due to the recombination of positive and negative ions, as separated ions in a transverse field still maintain their luminosity.
