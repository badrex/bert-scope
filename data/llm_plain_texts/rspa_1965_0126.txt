tldr: This article presents experiments on the hyperfine structure of ground multiplets in oxygen and fluorine atoms using paramagnetic resonance. The authors measure four magnetic hyperfine constants for oxygen and three for fluorine, finding that the usually accepted theory fails to explain the results. The findings suggest that a three-term Hamiltonian is necessary to represent the magnetic interactions in these atoms.
