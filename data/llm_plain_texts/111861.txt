tldr: The author, A.W. Hofmann, conducted research on arsenic-based compounds, specifically the bromide of bromethyl-triethylarsonium. They discovered its formation, properties, and reactions with other substances, including platinum and gold salts. This research expanded the understanding of organometallic chemistry and arsenic compounds.
