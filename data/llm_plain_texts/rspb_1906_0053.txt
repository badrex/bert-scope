tldr: 'This article discusses the discovery of phaseolunatin, a cyanogenetic enzyme, in cassava plants. The authors found that the "sweet" and "bitter" cassava plants contain this enzyme, which is responsible for the release of hydrocyanic acid, a toxic compound. The study highlights the importance of understanding the chemistry of cassava and its potential toxicity for human consumption.'
