tldr: This study investigates the sorption of ammonia by glass and its relationship with time, pressure, and temperature. The authors found that glass is an unsatisfactory sorbent due to its inability to be completely desiccated. They also discovered that the water content of glass can be kept nearly constant by regulating the temperature. The results show that the sorption process is influenced by both pressure and temperature, with higher temperatures leading to faster sorption rates.
