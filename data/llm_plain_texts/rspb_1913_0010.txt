tldr: The author examines trichromic vision and anomalous trichromatism, exploring how individuals perceive and differentiate colors. They found that some people have different color perceptions, leading to anomalous trichromatism, but these individuals do not necessarily have color weakness or be color-blind. The study also highlights the importance of understanding the differences in color perception and its implications.
