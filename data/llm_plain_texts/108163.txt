tldr: In 1839, a meteor exploded over the Cold Bokkeveld, Cape of Good Hope, and the resulting meteorite was analyzed by Thomas Maclear and Michael Faraday. The meteorite was found to be composed of iron, nickel, chromium, cobalt, and sulfur, with some traces of other elements. The explosion was heard over an area of more than 70 miles in diameter and caused a significant impact on the ground. The meteorite's composition and the event's description provided valuable insights into the study of meteorites and their effects on Earth.
