tldr: The author compares the constituent minerals of the granites of Scotland and Donegal, focusing on the differences in felspars, Oligoclase, Albite, and Mica. The study reveals that the granites of central and western Scotland are metamorphic rocks, while truly eruptive granite is rare. The author also discusses the oxygen ratios and analyses of these minerals, providing evidence for their classification.
