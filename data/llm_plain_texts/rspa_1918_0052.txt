tldr: The author presents a rational derivation of Dunkerley's empirical rule for calculating whirling speeds in loaded shafts, such as those found in turbines and turbine-driven machinery. The method involves dividing the load into parts and determining the speed for each part, then summing the squares of the reciprocals of these partial whirling speeds to find the first whirling speed for the whole load. The author also discusses the limitations of this method and how it can be extended for more accurate results.
