tldr: 'The article discusses the use of Occam, a parallel programming language, in the design and verification of microprocessors, specifically the IMS T800 transputer. The author highlights the importance of keeping an open mind when choosing appropriate formal techniques for different design levels and complexities. The article also explores the benefits of Occam's simplicity and anti-aliasing features in programming safety-critical applications and its compatibility with various design approaches.'
