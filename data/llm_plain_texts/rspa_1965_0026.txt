tldr: The article presents a method to determine the stress function for a rectangular plate under generalized plane stress, with a general distribution of normal and shear stress on all four sides. The method involves dividing the loading into four types of stress functions and solving the resulting equations to obtain the stress function for self-equilibrating stresses on each side. The final stress function can be used to analyze the behavior of structures under complex loading conditions.
