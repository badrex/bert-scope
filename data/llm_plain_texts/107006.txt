tldr: This article examines the relationship between temperature and health, specifically focusing on the impact of cold weather on the mortality rates in London. The author, William Heberden, compares the health outcomes of two contrasting Januarys - one extremely cold and the other mild. He finds that the mild winter led to lower mortality rates, contrary to the common belief that cold weather promotes health and vigor. The author also discusses the various ways in which cold weather can affect people's health, such as increasing the risk of asthma, chronic diseases, and putrid fevers.
