tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the combining properties of the thermostable opsonins in immune sera. They found that these opsonins are not affected by heating and are different from the thermolabile opsonins in normal sera. The authors also discovered that treating immune sera with substances that absorb complements has a similar effect on the serum as heating, leaving approximately the same amount of immune opsonin.
