tldr: The article discusses the United Kingdom's contribution to the International Biological Programme (IBP), focusing on the themes of biological productivity and human adaptability. The IBP aimed to bring ecology and human biology into the mainstream of biology, and the author argues that it has been successful in achieving this goal. However, the author also highlights the failure of the seventh section of the IBP, which was intended to focus on training and public relations.
