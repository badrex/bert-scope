tldr: The study investigates the unique clear-zone compound eye of the night-flying scarabaeid beetle, Anoplognathus. The eye has a short corneal cone and a crystalline cone that partially focuses light across the wide clear zone in the dark-adapted state. The eye's anatomy and function are analyzed using various methods, revealing its poor acuity but increased sensitivity to large objects. This research provides insight into the variety of optical and physiological adaptations in insect eyes.
