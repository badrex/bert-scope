tldr: The author investigates the oscillations produced in a gas-filled tube with varying cross-section, closed at one end by a rigid barrier and at the other by a vibrating piston. The study demonstrates that a tube with varying cross-section can produce significant changes in the solution for small variations, leading to a complicated Duffing-like response and increased amplitude compared to non-resonant and uniform tube oscillations.
