tldr: The authors present a new method for the reduced silver impregnation of arthropod central nervous systems, which provides reliable results without using buffered solutions, low silver concentrations, or prolonged incubation times. The method involves treating sections with a mercury-cobalt-nitric acid bath before using an urea-silver nitrate bath, resulting in better differentiation and impregnation of the nervous tissues.
