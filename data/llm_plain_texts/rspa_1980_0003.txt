tldr: The author conducted computer-simulated experiments to study the rate of ionic recombination in an ambient gas based on temperature and density. They found that the results for termolecular recombination can be represented by a quasi-universal curve, while binary recombination requires scaling procedures. The study also explored the influence of collision parameters on the recombination coefficients.
