tldr: The study investigates the depletion and recovery of catecholamines in the rat adrenal medulla and its relationship with dopamine β-hydroxylase. The research shows that exposure to a stressing atmosphere enhances the rate of catecholamine depletion by reserpine, and the recovery rate is slower when combined with exposure to CO2 compared to reserpine alone. The faster recovery rate after reserpine alone suggests the reuse of vesicular membranes that lost their catecholamine content.
