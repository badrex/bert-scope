tldr: The authors conducted a detailed study of the temperature dependence of longitudinal ultrasonic attenuation in white tin crystals. They measured the anisotropy of the superconducting energy gap and found that the energy gap parameter is a weighted average of the gap on the effective zone of the Fermi surface. The results provide insights into the anisotropy of the energy gap in tin and help to understand the ultrasonic averaging process.
