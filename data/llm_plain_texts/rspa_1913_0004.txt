tldr: The author synthesized a silicalcyanide compound and a felspar anorthite by reducing silica and alumino-silicates using metallic magnesium. The discovery of Calcium Silicalcyanide and the synthesis of felspar Anorthite supports the idea that aluminum plays a role in certain silicides, similar to nitrogen in organic compounds. This research provides insights into the constitution and natural relations of aluminosilicate minerals like plagio-clasic felspars.
