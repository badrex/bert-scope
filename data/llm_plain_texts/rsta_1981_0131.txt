tldr: 'This article discusses the secular variation of gamma-ray emission from the Crab pulsar (PSR 0531+21) using data collected by the COS-B satellite. The authors analyze four separate observations and construct gamma-ray light curves to study the time variation of the relative strengths of the two pulses. They find that the energy spectra of the pulses have the same form, and the variation in the pulse strengths cannot be attributed to changes in the detector performance. The results of all four observations are combined to improve the significance of the findings.'
