tldr: The authors attempted to detect the positronium Lyman alpha spectral line by stopping positrons in various inert gases and observing any optical signals. They used filters and a quartz monochromator to analyze the light, but did not observe the expected spectral line. The results were compared to other studies, and possible reasons for the negative findings were examined.
