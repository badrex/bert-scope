tldr: The author discusses a large, uniquely shaped flint implement found at Selsey Bill, which they call the "Selsey rostrate." The implement was made from a large nodule and has a rostrate (tapering) shape with no carina (central ridge). The author suggests that it was made and used by a person with larger hands and limbs than modern humans. The piece is significant in the study of prehistoric archaeology and paleolithic tools.
