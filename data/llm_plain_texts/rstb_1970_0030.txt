tldr: The authors studied the interglacial deposits at Wretton, Norfolk, and analyzed the flora and fauna found in the area. They discovered that the deposits were formed in the zones II and III of the Ipswichian interglacial and were associated with fluviatile environments of a meandering river. The plant and mollusk remains suggest that the climate during the interglacial period was more continental than present, with some species not native to the British post-glacial flora. The study provides valuable information about the Ipswichian interglacial period and its environmental conditions.
