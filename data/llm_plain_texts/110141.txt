tldr: This article presents experiments conducted by William Snow Harris to determine the relative conducting powers of various metallic substances. He found that the conducting powers of metals are inversely proportional to the heat evolved during the passage of an electric charge through them. The results showed that the conducting powers of silver and copper are similar, as are those of iron and platinum, while lead has the highest heat evolved and the lowest conducting power among the metals tested. The conducting powers of alloys are also discussed, revealing that the presence of inferior conducting metals in an alloy can reduce its overall conductivity.
