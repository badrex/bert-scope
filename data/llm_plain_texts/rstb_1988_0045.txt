tldr: 'The human gene map has advanced significantly with the help of recombinant DNA technology, allowing for prenatal diagnosis of genetic diseases and providing insights into the meiotic process and genome organization. The gene map has the potential to aid in the prevention and understanding of genetic diseases, offering a starting point for molecular approaches to poorly defined genes.'
