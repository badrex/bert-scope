tldr: This article investigates the recombination and energy balance in a decaying plasma containing helium and hydrogen. The authors apply a theory to laboratory data, finding that the results are in good agreement with experimental data. The study focuses on two extreme cases of plasma behavior and discusses the rates of transfer of thermal energy between the electron, ion, and atom gases.
