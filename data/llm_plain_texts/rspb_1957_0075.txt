tldr: This article discusses the importance of pH in preserving the viability of mammalian cells and tissues, specifically the cornea, during freezing and thawing processes. The author highlights the role of pH in the resistance of the corneal endothelium to toxic effects of glycerol and damage from freezing. The author also suggests that the buffering effect of proteins in biological fluids might be a rationale for incorporating them in preserving media for tissues and cells.
