tldr: This article explores the renormalization of nucleon-antinucleon interactions, focusing on the unique approach that covers both odd and even angular momentum states. The authors analyze the divergences associated with the integral equation for the interaction and find that a single renormalization constant is needed, unlike in previous studies on scattering. They also discuss the renormalized vertex equation, meson self-energy, and the numerical evaluation of the phase shift.
