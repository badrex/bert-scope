tldr: This article highlights the significant contributions of Edmond Halley to the field of hydrology. Halley demonstrated that the amount of water evaporating from oceans and watercourses was enough to replenish river flows, making him a co-founder of experimental hydrology. He also explained the process of evaporation and the formation of springs, proposing a unique hypothesis that involved the role of mountains in distilling fresh water for human and animal consumption.
