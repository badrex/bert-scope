tldr: The author discovered a unique soil bacterium that grows well on saccharine gelatine and has a gelatinous sheath surrounding its rods. This bacterium can be isolated from other bacteria and molds by heating the soil and using acid media. The bacterium's growth varies on different culture media, and its gelatinous sheath gradually disappears with repeated transfers or aging cultures.
