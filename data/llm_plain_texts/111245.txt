tldr: The author, Robert Lee, conducted dissections of the heart to study the nerves and ganglia within the muscular structure. He found that the heart's muscular walls were pervaded with numerous nerves, contrary to the belief that the heart's sensitive and contractile powers were independent of nervous influence. This discovery provided insight into the heart's action as an organ and the circulation of blood in the absence of a brain or spinal cord.
