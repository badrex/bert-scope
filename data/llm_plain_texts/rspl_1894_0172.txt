tldr: This article describes an experiment conducted by Lord Kelvin, Magnus Maclean, and Alexander Galt to investigate the diselectrification of air that has been electrified. They used a new experimental arrangement to test the efficiency of filters and other appliances in reducing the electrification of air. The authors found that cotton-wool between the spaces in the groups of wire gauzes increased the diselectrifying effect, but they still aimed to find more effective methods of achieving complete diselectrification.
