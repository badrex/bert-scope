tldr: This article investigates the stability of three-dimensional disturbances in flow between parallel planes, extending the work of Squire and Jungclaus. The author generalizes the stability diagram, creating a three-dimensional stability surface that helps determine the most unstable disturbance at a given Reynolds number. The findings show that a two-dimensional disturbance is the most unstable at Reynolds numbers above the critical, while for higher Reynolds numbers, each basic flow must be treated separately.
