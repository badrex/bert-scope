tldr: The authors studied the responses of spectrally opponent neurons in the macaque lateral geniculate nucleus to stimuli with successive contrast. They found that strongly opponent cells displayed spectrally selective responses at low luminance ratios, while weakly opponent cells had higher chromatic thresholds and responded well to stimuli at higher luminance ratios. The results provide insights into how the primate visual system processes color and lightness under various conditions.
