tldr: This study examines the interaction of oxygen with high-purity evaporated germanium films at low temperatures. The research finds that there is an initial fast process followed by a slow uptake of oxygen, which follows an Elovich equation. The results show that the oxygen uptake affects the surface area and electrical properties of the germanium, leading to changes in work function, surface conductance, and field effects.
