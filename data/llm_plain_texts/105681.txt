tldr: John Canton conducted experiments to prove that water is not incompressible. He found that water expands by 1 part in 21,740 when the weight of the atmosphere is removed and is compressed by 1 part in 10,870 under twice the atmospheric pressure. This discovery challenged the famous Florentine experiment and provided insights into the properties of water under varying pressures.
