tldr: The authors studied the optical and electrical properties of silver azide and found that light absorption in the crystal produces excitons, which dissociate into free electrons and positive holes. This research helps explain the photochemical and thermal decomposition of silver azide, providing insights into the initiation and growth of reactions in the solid state.
