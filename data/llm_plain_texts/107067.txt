tldr: The author conducted a chemical analysis of various calamines and discovered their composition and properties. They found that calamine consists of calx of zinc, carbonic acid, and water. The author also determined that the carbonates of lime and lead in calamine are accidental admixtures. The study provides valuable insights into the composition and properties of calamines, contributing to the understanding of mineralogy and chemistry.
