tldr: The authors develop a theory for the moving boundary method to determine transport numbers and equivalent conductivities in electrolyte solutions. They explain the fundamental principles, terminology, and mathematical equations involved in the method, and discuss its applications and limitations. This work provides a comprehensive understanding of the moving boundary method and its significance in the field of electrochemistry.
