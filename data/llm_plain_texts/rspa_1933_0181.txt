tldr: The authors compared the catalytic activity of solid and liquid zinc surfaces in the decomposition of methanol. They found that the activity of the solid zinc was not uniformly distributed, and the liquid zinc had a higher catalytic activity. This study provides insights into the nature of catalyst surfaces and their activity.
