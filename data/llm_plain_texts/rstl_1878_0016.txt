tldr: The author examines the placenta structure in apes, comparing it to the human female placenta. They conducted a study on a pregnant Macacus cynomolgus, analyzing the placenta's form, presence of decidua, arrangement of umbilical vessels, and the absence of the allantois sac. The research found that the placenta in apes is similar in structure and form to the human placenta, with some differences in the arrangement of the intra-placental decidua and the presence of utricular glands in the serotina.
