tldr: The author, Anthony van Leeuwenhoeck, observed and documented the development of snail eggs, the growth of plant roots, the structure of teeth, and the anatomy of young oysters using a microscope. He discovered that snails hatch from eggs and that the eggs can be found in the soil. He also observed the intricate structure of plant roots and the development of teeth in animals.
