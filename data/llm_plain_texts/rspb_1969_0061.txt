tldr: The author discusses the enzymic aspects of plasma kinin formation, focusing on the activation of factor XII and the role of enzyme systems in triggering responses to surfaces. The study explores the different factors involved in the intrinsic plasma kinin forming system and the potential properties of surfaces that activate factor XII. The author also examines the various enzymes and their bond specificities in the process of kinin formation.
