revised_title: 'Holliday Junctions and Homologous Genetic Recombination: Processing and Resolution'
semantic_tags:
  - DNA repair
  - Genetic recombination
  - Holliday junctions
  - Recombination proteins
  - Branch migration
tldr: This article discusses the process of homologous genetic recombination, focusing on the formation, translocation, and resolution of Holliday junctions. The roles of proteins such as RuvA, RuvB, and RuvC in branch migration and junction resolution are explored, providing insight into the mechanisms of DNA repair and recombination.
