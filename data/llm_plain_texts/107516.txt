tldr: The author, David Brewster, investigates the properties of heat and its effects on the propagation of light through crystallized glass. He discovers that the crystalline structure of the glass influences the behavior of polarized light and that heat can alter this structure, leading to changes in the appearance of the glass. Brewster also observes similarities between the phenomena of crystallized glass and magnetism.
