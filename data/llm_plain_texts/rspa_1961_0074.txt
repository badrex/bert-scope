tldr: The authors conducted a study on the electronic structure of first row hydrides, focusing on the predissociation by rotation in the A state. They found that the potential energy curve for the state has a maximum, which is related to the crossing of zero-order curves. This study provides a better understanding of potential curves with maxima in diatomic molecules and improves the accuracy of energy calculations for these molecules.
