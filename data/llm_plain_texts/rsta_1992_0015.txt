tldr: This study presents a new derivation of an archetypal equation for ship capsize studies, focusing on the coupling action between heave and roll. The authors explore the effects of direct and parametric wave excitation on ship stability, providing valuable insights into the mechanics of ship capsize and the importance of transient size. The research suggests that understanding these dynamics can help improve boat designs and survival in extreme conditions.
