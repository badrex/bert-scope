tldr: The authors investigated the nitrogenous constituents of barley leaves to understand protein catabolism in starving leaves. They found that most of the amide nitrogen comes from secondary sources and that asparagine and glutamine are formed during the breakdown of leaf proteins. The study provides insights into the relationship between proteolysis and amide formation in barley leaves, which can help in understanding plant metabolism.
