revised_title: 'Conformal Spaces in General Relativity'
semantic_tags:
  - General Relativity
  - Conformal Geometry
  - Space-Time
  - Mathematical Physics
  - Spinors
tldr: The authors explore conformal spaces in the context of general relativity, focusing on spinors and the properties of space-time. They demonstrate that certain spaces are conformal to a class of spaces and discuss the implications of this relationship.
