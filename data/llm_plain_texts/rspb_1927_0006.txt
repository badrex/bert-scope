tldr: The study investigates the effects of X-ray sterilisation on the oestrous cycle and reproductive system in mice. The results show that X-ray exposure can cause disintegration of Graafian follicles and eliminate the cyclic structures of the ovary, but the accessory organs still experience periodic changes. The study also explores the effects of sterilisation at different stages of pregnancy and the mechanisms of hormonal regulation in the oestrous cycle.
