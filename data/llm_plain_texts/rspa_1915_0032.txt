tldr: The author examines the possible forms of distribution of gaseous material under its own gravity, focusing on the nebular theory. They explore various mathematical solutions for different symmetries and discuss the effects of rotation on the distribution of a nebula. The study provides insights into the forms and behaviors of astronomical phenomena, such as nebulae and their evolution.
