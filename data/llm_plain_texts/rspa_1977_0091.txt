tldr: The author extends the previous study on the momentum of light in a refracting medium and shows that the formula for the momentum is independent of the shape of the light pulse. The paper also discusses the impulse given to a mirror by a light pulse reflected from it, considering the case of oblique incidence, where the electric vector is in the plane of incidence.
