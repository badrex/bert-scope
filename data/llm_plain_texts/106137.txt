revised_title: 'Securing Buildings from Lightning: The Debate on Conductors and Points'
semantic_tags:
  - Lightning protection
  - Conductors
  - Franklin's experiments
  - Electric fluid
  - Pointed conductors
tldr: This article discusses the author's observations and experiments on lightning protection and the use of conductors in securing buildings from lightning. The author argues against the use of pointed conductors, as they can collect lightning in too powerful a manner, and suggests that conductors should be made of a single, continuous piece of metal with a uniform diameter.
