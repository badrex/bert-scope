tldr: The author observed a unique, half-circle arch of colors in the sky after sunset, which he called a "nocturnal solar iris." This phenomenon appeared in the opposite direction of the setting sun and was formed by the sun's rays reflecting off tiny particles of evening vapors and city smoke. The author believes this is an uncommon occurrence and shares his observations with the Royal Society.
