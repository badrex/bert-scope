tldr: Philip Burton Moon was an experimental physicist who made significant contributions to atomic and nuclear physics, chemistry, and other scientific fields. He is known for his work on neutron thermalization, selective absorption of slow neutrons, and the development of high-speed rotors for studying chemical reactions and nuclear resonant scattering. Moon's research had a lasting impact on the understanding of neutron behavior and the broader field of nuclear physics.
