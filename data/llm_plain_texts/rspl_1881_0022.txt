tldr: The author investigates the phosphorescent properties of various substances, particularly alumina, when exposed to high vacuums and molecular discharge. They discover that the phosphorescence emitted by these substances is discontinuous, with some substances showing unique spectral lines. This research sheds light on the relationship between molecular impact and sunlight in producing luminosity and the optical properties of gemstones like ruby and sapphire.
