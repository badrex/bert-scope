tldr: The author presents a study on the general results in the theory of large elastic deformations, focusing on materials with curvilinear aeolotropy. They derive relations that are independent of the form of the strain-energy function and the material's symmetries, making them applicable to isotropic, orthotropic, and transversely isotropic materials. The study covers compressible and incompressible bodies and includes examples of cylindrical and cuboidal deformations.
