tldr: 'This study examines the pigments in Artemia, a type of brine shrimp. The authors found that the eggs' color varies due to different amounts of haematin in the eggshells. The nauplii are orange due to a carotenoid pigment, astaxanthin, which is also present in the eggs. Adult Artemia contains a small amount of astaxanthin ester, presumably derived from the egg. The carotenoids from two types of algae, Dunaliella and Phaeodactylum, were also examined. Adult Artemia retains varying amounts of algal carotenoids and converts some to astaxanthin, which becomes esterified and is the most abundant carotenoid in the animal. The study provides insight into the carotenoids present in lower crustaceans, specifically the subclass Branchiopoda.'
