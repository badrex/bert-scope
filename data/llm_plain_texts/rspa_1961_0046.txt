tldr: The authors developed a new thin-film multiple-beam interference technique to study spiral patterns on the basal planes of synthetic quartz crystals. These spirals have high visibility and show both single and interlaced triangular spirals, enclosed within a linear boundary. The technique provides remarkably fine interferometric definition, even with high lateral magnification, and can resolve step-heights of around 5 Å. The spirals on synthetic quartz differ in character from the usual growth spirals, being shallow ruts running around hillocks.
