tldr: The authors studied the oxidation of ethyl alcohol (ethanol) and found that during the later stages of reaction, the yields of acetaldehyde and hydrogen peroxide decrease, while methanol, formaldehyde, carbon monoxide, and water increase. They discovered that the formation of carbon monoxide and methane closely parallels the increase in total pressure during the reaction. The results suggest that ethanol oxidation proceeds through a degenerate chain-branching mechanism involving aldehydes and organic peroxides.
