tldr: In a letter to Mr. Allan Ramsay, Camillo Paderni describes the discovery of a subterranean town near Naples, containing ancient statues, paintings, and other artifacts. The author expresses concern for the preservation and restoration of these valuable pieces, as they are being discovered and handled by those lacking proper knowledge and care. The letter also includes detailed descriptions of some of the remarkable paintings and sculptures found in the subterranean town.
