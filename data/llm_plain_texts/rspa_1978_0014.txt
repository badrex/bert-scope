tldr: The authors calculated elastic and charge-transfer cross-sections for collisions of protons and deuterons with deuterium and hydrogen atoms using a fully quantum mechanical method. They obtained accurate phase shifts by solving a pair of coupled radial Schrödinger equations and compared the cross-sections with previous experimental and theoretical values. This study covers a wide range of energy values, from 0.001 to 7.5 atomic units, and provides insights into the scattering states of hydrogen isotopes.
