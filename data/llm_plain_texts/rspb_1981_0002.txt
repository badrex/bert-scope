tldr: The article examines the action of gallamine, a competitive neuromuscular blocking agent, on voltage-clamped endplates of frog skeletal muscle fibers. The results show that gallamine produces a parallel shift of the equilibrium concentration-response curves and has a non-voltage-dependent competitive block. Additionally, the study finds that gallamine's mechanism of action involves blocking open ion channels, similar to procaine or quaternary local anesthetic analogues. This discovery contributes to understanding the complex interactions of drugs with ion channels in the postsynaptic membrane.
