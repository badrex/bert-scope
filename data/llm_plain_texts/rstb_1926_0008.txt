tldr: The author examines the formation of colonies in Astraeaoid corals, focusing on the development of polyps and their internal anatomy. They describe two methods of polyp formation: intra-tentacular budding, where new polyps develop within the tentacles of older polyps, and extra-tentacular budding, where new polyps form outside the tentacles. The study provides a detailed analysis of the process of colony formation and polyp development in these corals.
