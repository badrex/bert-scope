tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the diurnal and seasonal variations in ionization in the upper atmosphere using the critical-frequency method. They found that ultra-violet light from the sun is the main ionizing agent for the Kennelly-Heaviside region, and their results contribute to a better understanding of the ionosphere and its behavior.
