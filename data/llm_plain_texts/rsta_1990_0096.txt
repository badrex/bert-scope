tldr: This article discusses the concept of terranes and their role in understanding plate boundary evolution. The author argues that terrane analysis should be considered a subset of plate boundary kinematics and should not be seen as a separate methodology or process. The author also highlights the importance of considering the size and history of oceanic complexes and plate slip rates in different orogenic belts when analyzing terranes.
