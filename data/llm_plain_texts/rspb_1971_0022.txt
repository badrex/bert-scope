tldr: The study investigates copper tolerance in various populations of the monkey flower, Mimulus guttatus, found in Californian copper mines. It shows that these populations are tolerant to high levels of copper and suggests that this tolerance is genetically controlled. The research also indicates that there may be a requirement for copper at low concentrations among the offspring of tolerant parents, possibly due to a mechanism that complexes the copper and makes it unavailable to the plant.
