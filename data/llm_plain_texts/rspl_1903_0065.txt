tldr: This study investigates the vapour pressures of liquid oxygen on the scales of the constant-volume oxygen and nitrogen thermometers. The authors found that the readings of the gas thermometer vary with the initial pressure, and their results are in accordance with Callendar's calculations of the deviation from the thermodynamic scale. The findings can help improve the accuracy of temperature measurements using gas thermometers.
