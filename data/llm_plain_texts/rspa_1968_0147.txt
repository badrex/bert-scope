tldr: This article presents a general theory of equilibrium paths through critical points, focusing on the conditions necessary and sufficient for a function of many variables to have a stationary local minimum. The analysis uses the concept of order of contact between the energy surface and the configuration space, leading to a sequence of equations that characterize equilibrium paths under dead loading. The results are applicable to the stability and static strength of conservative systems.
