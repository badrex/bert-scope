tldr: The authors investigate the extraction and properties of yeast cell plasma, also known as "Zymase," which is a soluble enzyme responsible for alcoholic fermentation. They describe their method of preparing the cell plasma and discuss its physical properties, as well as the auto-fermentation that occurs in the juice. Their findings contribute to the understanding of yeast cell biology and fermentation processes.
