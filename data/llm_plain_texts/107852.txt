tldr: 'The author, John Blackburn, describes the design and function of a sounding board in Attercliffe Church. The sounding board has a parabolic surface that focuses sound towards the audience, improving the clarity of the speaker's voice. The design allows for better sound reflection and can be beneficial for listeners in various parts of the church. Blackburn also discusses the potential for further improvements in the design.'
