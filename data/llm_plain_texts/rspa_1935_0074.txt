tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the electronic spectra of polyatomic molecules, specifically saturated aldehydes. They used a method developed by Lennard-Jones and applied to diatomic molecules by Hund, Mulliken, and Lennard-Jones to analyze the electronic structures of these molecules. The study aimed to understand the forces between ions and gas molecules and the effect of electron exchange on the mobility of ions.
