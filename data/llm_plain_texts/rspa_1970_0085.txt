tldr: The authors conducted isotopic tracer studies to understand the role of butenes in the combustion of n-butane. They found that butene-1 and butene-2 are the main initial products formed during the combustion process. These compounds are important intermediates in the formation of heterocyclic compounds. The study also showed that the butene-1 to butene-2 ratio and alkene to heterocycle ratio increase as the temperature increases.
