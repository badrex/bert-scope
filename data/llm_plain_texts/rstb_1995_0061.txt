tldr: The article discusses the importance of remote sensing in studying ocean primary production and its role in the global carbon cycle. The authors emphasize the use of satellite data on ocean color to estimate primary production at large scales, combining it with data collected by ships. They also highlight the challenges in using remote sensing, such as uneven coverage and the need for extrapolation methods. The study focuses on the North Atlantic, where this approach is best developed, and provides an estimate of the annual primary production at the basin scale.
