tldr: The author presents a new class of spheroidal wave-forms, which are solutions to the wave motion equation. These wave-forms are essential for solving problems involving the passage of waves around or through circular obstacles or apertures. The author demonstrates the general nature of this class and discusses various applications, including wave motion in oblate spheroidal coordinates.
