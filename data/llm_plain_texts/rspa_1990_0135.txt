tldr: The authors study the electrical resistance of the Sierpiński carpet, a fractal structure, and prove that there exists a constant such that the resistance is inversely proportional to the square of the side length of the carpet. This research contributes to understanding the spectral dimension of the Sierpiński carpet, which is related to the properties of random walks and diffusion processes on fractals.
