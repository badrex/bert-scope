tldr: The article discusses the importance of enzymes in the pericellular environment and their role in the degradation of connective tissues in vertebrates. The authors describe the secretion of enzymes like cathepsin D, CPGases, and cathepsin Bl, which play a crucial part in the local turnover of matrix macromolecules. These enzymes are involved in the degradation of collagen and proteoglycan, which are essential components of the extracellular matrix. The excessive degradation of these components in diseases like rheumatoid arthritis is linked to the secretion of these enzymes.
