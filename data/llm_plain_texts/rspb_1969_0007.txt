tldr: The authors discovered that adult schistosomes, the parasites responsible for schistosomiasis, can evade the host's immune system by incorporating host antigens into their surface. This allows the worms to avoid being destroyed by the host's immune response, enabling them to persist in the blood for long periods. The study provides insights into the complex relationship between the parasite and the host, and may lead to new strategies for treating and preventing schistosomiasis.
