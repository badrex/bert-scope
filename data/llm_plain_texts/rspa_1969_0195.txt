tldr: This article discusses the theoretical aspects of discrete X-ray sources in cosmic X-ray astronomy. It explores the energy spectra and emission mechanisms of these sources, focusing on thermal bremsstrahlung and the synchrotron process. The article also examines the variability, distance, and radio emissions of specific X-ray sources like Sco X-1 and Cen X-2.
