tldr: The authors developed an accurate method for measuring the vapor pressures of liquids and applied it to study the vapor pressure of pure benzene. They used a static method of vapor-pressure measurement and a bellows-type differential manometer to determine the total vapor pressure of the system. The experimental technique allowed them to measure vapor pressures with an accuracy of a few parts in ten thousand, which helped in understanding the thermodynamics of hydrocarbon solutions.
