tldr: The authors compare the minimum plastic spin and rate sensitive slip theories for loading symmetrical crystal orientations. They find that the predictions of both theories are similar in certain cases, and the rate sensitive approach provides unique solutions for slip distributions and grain rotations. The study helps in understanding crystal plasticity and texture development in polycrystals.
