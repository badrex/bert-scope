tldr: The article discusses the anatomy and physiology of the nociceptive modulatory system, a network responsible for controlling pain sensation. It explains how this system, which includes interconnected components at midbrain, medullary, and spinal levels, can be activated by various stressful factors and can help prevent escape or withdrawal responses and reduce the intensity of perceived pain. The role of endorphins and opiates in this system is also explored.
