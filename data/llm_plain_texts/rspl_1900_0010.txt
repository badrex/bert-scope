tldr: The author investigates the electrical effects of light on green leaves and discovers that they respond electrically to light, creating a potential difference between illuminated and non-illuminated parts of the leaf. The response is influenced by factors such as temperature, leaf age, and the presence of carbon dioxide. This research provides insights into the relationship between light, plant physiology, and electrical responses.
