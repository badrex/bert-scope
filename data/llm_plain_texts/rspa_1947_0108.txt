tldr: This article presents a quantum mechanical approach to the general kinetic theory of liquids, focusing on the behavior of fluids at low temperatures and the superfluidity of helium-1. The authors develop a quantum hydrodynamics framework and discuss the different possibilities for explaining superfluidity, while postponing the solution to a following publication.
