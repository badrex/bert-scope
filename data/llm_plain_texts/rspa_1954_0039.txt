tldr: The authors analyze the atomic configurations and spectra of the first and second long periods in the periodic table. They use theoretical formulae based on Slater parameters to compare the lowest terms of the configurations in successive elements across the periods. The study reveals astonishing regularities in the junctions between configurations, which differ in the two long periods.
