tldr: 'This study focuses on the mathematical modeling of arthropod filiform hair dynamics, particularly spider trichobothria, in oscillating air flows. The authors analyze the behavior of hair motion using numerical calculations of the equation for conservation of hair angular momentum, considering air-induced drag and virtual mass forces. They demonstrate the effects of air motion orientation, hair length, and shape on hair displacement, velocity, and acceleration. The findings can be applied to better understand the connection between hair structure, air flow stimuli, and animal behavioral response.'
