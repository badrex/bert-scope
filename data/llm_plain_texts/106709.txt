tldr: The author, Alexander Baxter, observed a halo and parhelia (mock suns) in North-America in 1771. The phenomenon occurred at Fort Gloucester, near Lake Superior. A large circle or halo surrounded the sun, with a luminous cross directly opposite the sun. Five mock suns were visible in a horizontal circle, and a rainbow was observed near the zenith. The phenomenon lasted for about an hour before gradually disappearing.
