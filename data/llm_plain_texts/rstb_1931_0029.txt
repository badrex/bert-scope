tldr: The authors studied the biochemical characteristics of two Penicillium species responsible for rotting citrus fruits, P. digitatum and P. italicum. They found that each species has distinct biochemical properties and identified the production of volatile materials and ethyl acetate in P. digitatum. The research also involved the isolation and analysis of a complex carbohydrate from the mycelium of the strains.
