tldr: The authors studied the cellular immune response in rats with primary sarcomata by analyzing the large basophilic cells, or immunoblasts, in the thoracic duct lymph after antigenic challenge. They found that the number of immunoblasts increased three days after challenge and returned to normal by the 10th day. This method can be used to measure the immune response of individual animals and help understand the immune system's reaction to tumors.
