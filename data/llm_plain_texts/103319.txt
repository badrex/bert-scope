tldr: The author conducts experiments and mathematical analysis to study the motion of water, both in simple and mixed scenarios. They develop a theorem to determine the quantities of water discharged based on the depths, breadths, and times of the efflux. The author applies this theory to real-world situations, such as river flow and tides in harbors, demonstrating its usefulness in engineering and environmental applications.
