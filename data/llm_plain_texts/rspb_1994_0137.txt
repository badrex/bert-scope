tldr: The authors develop an analytical model to determine optimal departure fat loads and stopover site use for time-minimizing bird migration. The model considers various factors, such as site quality, fattening rates, and stochasticity in fat deposition. The results show that birds usually carry fat loads necessary for reaching the next stopover site or for a non-stop flight to the breeding ground, with overloads being deposited under rare circumstances.
