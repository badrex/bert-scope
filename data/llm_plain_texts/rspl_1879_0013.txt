tldr: The author describes the audiometer, a new instrument invented by Professor Hughes, which measures hearing capacity. The audiometer works by detecting the sound produced by a microphonic key connected to a battery, primary coils, and a secondary or induction coil. The author explains how to use the instrument, the importance of a quiet environment, and the suddenness of sound loss for those with hearing difficulties. The audiometer can help determine hearing capacity in various individuals, including those with physical defects, memory issues, and even animals.
