tldr: The author, George Boole, presents a method to integrate simultaneous differential equations and solve partial differential equations of the second order. This method allows for the determination of the number of possible integrals and the conditions of success in the integration of partial differential equations. The author also demonstrates the application of this method to the investigation of the conditions of integrability of ordinary differential expressions.
