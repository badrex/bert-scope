tldr: The authors present a generalized theoretical approach to study the dynamic interaction between an arbitrarily located and oriented microdefect and a finite main crack under plane deformation. They use integral transform techniques and superposition procedures to obtain dynamic stress intensity factors at the main crack. The results can be used in micromechanics, damage assessment, and non-destructive characterization of defects in solids.
