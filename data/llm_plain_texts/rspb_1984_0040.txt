tldr: The authors conducted a high-resolution electron microscopic investigation of magnetite particles isolated from magnetotactic bacteria. They found that the particles have a hexagonal prism habit and are single-domain structures. The study suggests that crystal growth of biogenic magnetite involves nucleation followed by slow growth, with the surrounding membrane potentially playing a role in magnetite synthesis.
