tldr: The article discusses the steam-aqueous pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass to fractionate and modify its components for various applications, such as animal feed, paper manufacturing, and bioenergy production. The process involves using steam to break down the complex structure of lignocellulosic materials, making them more accessible to enzymes and chemicals. The resulting fractions can be used to produce biofuels, chemicals, and other bioproducts.
