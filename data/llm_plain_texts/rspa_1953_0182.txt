tldr: The authors studied the radioactive decay of 41Ca and found that it decays by orbital electron capture with a half-life of 1 year. They discussed the assignment of this activity to 41Ca and compared the half-life with values obtained from decay theory. The experiments involved irradiating calcium with slow neutrons and analyzing the resulting radioactive decay.
