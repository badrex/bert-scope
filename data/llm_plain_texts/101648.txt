tldr: Mr. J.L. shares a letter about poisonous fish found in one of the Bahama Islands. These fish cause joint pain to those who consume them, and the poison can be revived in people who have previously had the disease upon eating any fish. The letter also mentions that cats and dogs sometimes die after eating the poisonous fish. The author is expecting more information from someone on the island to provide a more detailed account of this phenomenon.
