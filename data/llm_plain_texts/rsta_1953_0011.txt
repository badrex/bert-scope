tldr: This study investigates the nature and origin of whistling atmospherics, also known as whistlers, which are musical tones observed at low frequencies. The research focuses on analyzing the properties of whistlers, their frequency variations, and their relationship with impulsive atmospherics. A theory is developed to explain their origin, suggesting that whistlers are due to waves originating from normal impulsive atmospherics and traveling through the outer ionosphere along the Earth's magnetic field lines. The findings have implications for understanding the relationship between whistlers and magnetic activity.
