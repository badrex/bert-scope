tldr: The authors investigate the phenomena of radio wave propagation across a boundary between two different sections of the Earth's surface. They analyze the effects of varying electrical properties of the terrain and provide a theoretical treatment for the propagation of vertically polarized radio waves. The study focuses on the impact of a boundary of discontinuity, such as a coastline, on radio wave propagation and its practical implications in field-strength assessment, direction-finding, and navigation.
