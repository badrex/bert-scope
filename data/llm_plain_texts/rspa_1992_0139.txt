tldr: The author presents a new path integral for the Weyl propagator in phase space, which represents the evolution operator in phase space. This new formula allows for a more general and simplified representation of products of operators in the Weyl representation, and is invariant under symplectic transformations. The Weyl propagator can be used to generalize previous phase space path integrals and provide a more complete understanding of the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian operator.
