tldr: This article explores the quantum theory of lattice dynamics and the expansion of the total energy of electrons in a crystal. The authors derive expressions for the electronic contributions to the dynamical and anharmonic tensors using the Hartree-Fock approximation. They discuss the first-order, second-order, and third-order terms in the expansion and their implications for the effective potential energy of the nuclei in a crystal.
