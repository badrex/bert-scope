revised_title: 'Investigation of Reflexion Properties of Low-Frequency Radio Waves on the Ionosphere'

tldr: The authors investigate the properties of the two principal reflexions of low-frequency radio waves obliquely incident on the ionosphere. They use full-wave numerical methods to study the behavior of the reflected wave and its polarization, finding significant changes in certain directions that could have important consequences for radio communication links.
