tldr: The author investigates the yield point of iron and steel and the effect of repeated straining and annealing. They discover that the yield point is a significant feature in materials that have been rolled or hammered, and that annealing can reverse the changes caused by straining. The study also suggests that the yield point may be due to a chemical or molecular change similar to that which occurs in tempering by sudden cooling.
