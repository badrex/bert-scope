tldr: The authors studied the factors affecting catalytic actions at solid surfaces, specifically the surface area and the specific nature of a catalyst. They found that catalytic activity is determined by two factors: the presence of a suitable surface and the presence of a chemical agent (catalyst) that forms appropriate intermediate compounds with the reactants. The authors conducted experiments with various types of nickel oxide catalysts and found that the activity of the catalyst is influenced by the surface area and the physical state of the oxide. They concluded that the active agent in hydrogenation is not a sub-oxide of nickel, but rather the nickel itself, distributed on the support material.
