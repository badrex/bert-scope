tldr: This paper examines the dynamic response behavior of small waterplane area twin-hull (SWATH) vessels in waves using a linear, general hydroelasticity theory. The study focuses on the practical application of hydroelasticity to non-beamlike ships, specifically SWATH ships. The research demonstrates the flexibility of applying hydroelasticity as a unified research tool and design aid at different design stages, from conceptual to detailed design. The findings can help establish hydroelasticity as an essential technique in the study of sea-going vessels.
