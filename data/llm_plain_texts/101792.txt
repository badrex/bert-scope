tldr: The author presents a comprehensive argument against atheism, discussing various forms of atheism and their origins in ancient philosophy. They argue that the concept of an omnipotent, understanding being is necessary for explaining the existence of moral good and evil, and that the idea of God is not derived from abstract notions but from the natural world. The author also addresses objections to the idea of God, such as the existence of polytheism and the concept of a Trinity, and demonstrates the impossibility of atheism through logical reasoning.
