tldr: This article discusses the potential and challenges of using biomass and solar energy for renewable energy production. It examines the efficiency of solar energy conversion in plants and the contribution of biomass to global energy demands. The authors also explore the limitations of solar radiation, such as its low energy density and intermittent nature, and the need for large surface areas of solar collectors and energy storage systems. They conclude that biomass will not be able to provide a substantial fraction of the world's energy demand, but can make a useful contribution.
