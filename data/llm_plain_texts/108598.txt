tldr: The author describes the process of constructing a standard barometer and the apparatus used to verify barometers at the Kew Observatory. They discuss the challenges faced, such as mercury adhesion to the glass and the formation of dirt rings, and the solutions implemented to improve the accuracy of barometers. The author also explains the method of temperature correction and the comparison of the Kew Standard Barometer with the Paris Standard Barometer.
