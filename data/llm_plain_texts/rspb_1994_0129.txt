revised_title: 'British Bird Species Abundance Patterns and Lognormal Distributions'

tldr: 'The author analyzes a data set on British bird abundances and finds that the frequency distribution of bird species is skewed to the left. The results suggest that bird species abundances may be drawn independently from a lognormal distribution, and the study confirms earlier findings that species abundances tend to follow lognormal frequency distributions. The author also discusses the implications of these findings for modeling species abundances and the ecological and evolutionary processes underlying these patterns.'
