tldr: The author presents a mathematical analysis of a simple nonlinear model for the diffusion of an impurity via a vacancy mechanism. The model consists of a pair of diffusion equations for impurity and vacancy concentrations. Similarity and exact solutions are discussed, and asymptotic methods are applied to the constant surface concentration problem. The model predicts double profiles, which are commonly observed in diffusion into semiconductors.
