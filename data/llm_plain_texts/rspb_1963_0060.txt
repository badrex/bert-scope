tldr: The study examines the surface anatomy of Lampropedia hyalina, a microbial organism that forms rectangular arrays of cells. The researchers used various electron microscopical techniques to analyze the outer layers of the organism. They discovered a complex structure composed of two layers: a honeycomb network and a layer of spines. The structured envelope is separated from the cells by an amorphous zone, which may play a role in cell cohesion. The significance of the structured envelope is still uncertain, but it may help separate the organism into tablets by preventing intercell cohesion.
