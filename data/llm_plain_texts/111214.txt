tldr: In December 1852, Francis Higginson observed an explosive meteorite over Dover. The meteorite had a red, obscure nucleus with a tail and produced a hissing sound as it descended. It exploded with a report similar to heavy thunder, creating a bright light that rendered objects visible despite the rain and dark clouds. The meteorite fell into the water near the coast.
