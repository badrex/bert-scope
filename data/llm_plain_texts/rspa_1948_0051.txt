tldr: The authors studied the detailed mechanism of the reaction between carbon dioxide and coconut shell charcoal. They used both flow and static methods to investigate the reaction's rate, temperature, and gas pressures. The results showed that the reaction occurs in two stages, with the first stage being the decomposition of carbon dioxide molecules and the second stage being the evaporation of adsorbed oxygen atoms and carbon atoms to form gaseous carbon monoxide. The authors also found that the presence of carbon monoxide retards the reaction due to its adsorption on the reaction sites.
