tldr: The authors present a new exact and explicit cylindrically symmetric interior solution for charged dust rotating with arbitrary values of charge and mass in general relativity. This solution is well-behaved and regular for certain constant values, and it demonstrates how the Lorentz force on a typical particle is balanced by the gravitational force. The solution does not have a suitable limit as the charge tends to zero, highlighting the importance of charge in this context.
