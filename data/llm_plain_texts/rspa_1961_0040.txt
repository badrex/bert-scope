tldr: The authors develop a rigorous theory to obtain corrections to the Hartree-Fock wave function and energy of many-electron systems using electron pairs and exclusion effects. They use formal perturbation theory with operator techniques, avoiding infinite sums common in the Schrodinger method. This approach allows separate treatment of core and valence electrons, sigma and pi electrons, and provides a basis for various chemical concepts.
