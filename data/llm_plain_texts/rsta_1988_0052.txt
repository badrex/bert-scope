tldr: The article investigates the renewal rates of waters in the eastern North Atlantic's thermocline by combining linear quasi-geostrophic dynamics with steady and transient tracers into a unified eclectic reservoir model. The study finds that the region is primarily flushed from the north and east, and the missing time histories of the new set of unknowns mean that tritium and helium-3 distributions are only comparatively weak constraints on the flow field, but do set upper bounds on the vertical exchange with surface waters.
