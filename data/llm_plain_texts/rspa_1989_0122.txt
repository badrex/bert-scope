tldr: The authors present numerical techniques to determine the Titchmarsh-Weyl m-coefficient for a singular eigenvalue equation and apply the results to find best constants for Everitt's extension of the Hardy-Littlewood-Polya integral inequality. They use numerical methods to estimate the Dirichlet and Neumann eigenvalues and the Titchmarsh-Weyl function, confirming known cases and providing new insights into the behavior of the sets and the value of the best constant.
