tldr: The author, Frederick W. Pavy, investigates the liver's role in sugar formation and the presence of a substance called hepatine. He concludes that the liver transforms materials from food into hepatine, which can be converted into sugar after death. The liver's size and weight increase with the consumption of starchy and sugary substances. Pavy also discusses the relationship between the nervous system, abnormal states of circulation, and the formation of sugar in the system.
