tldr: Researchers have purified a protein kinase in yeast that shares similarities with mammalian protein kinase C (PKC). The enzyme is activated by diacylglycerol and phospholipids and can be separated into three distinct PKC-like activities. This discovery sheds light on the potential involvement of PKC in yeast and its possible role in cellular processes.
