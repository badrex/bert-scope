tldr: The authors conducted a series of experiments on the mammalian heart to study its physiology and pathology under various conditions. They employed a cardiometer and myocardiograph to measure the heart's contraction volume, output, and changes in volume. The study focused on the effects of the vagus nerve and nervi augmentores on the heart, revealing their impact on heart rhythm, force, and output. The findings provide valuable insights into the functioning and potential issues within the mammalian heart.
