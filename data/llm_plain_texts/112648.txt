tldr: A.W. Hofmann describes the transformation of aromatic monamines into carbon-rich acids through various chemical reactions. He discusses the formation of phenylformamide, tolylformamide, and naphthylformamide, as well as the production of diphenylamine, benzonitrile, and tolylic acid. These reactions have implications for the manufacture of coal-tar colors and the synthesis of new compounds.
