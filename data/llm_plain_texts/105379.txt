tldr: 'In October 1759, Mr. William Dutton, a watchmaker, observed a meteor in Chigwell Row, Essex. The meteor was round, about the size of Venus, with a light bluish cast. It moved quickly from north to south and vanished at a height of 4 to 5 degrees above the horizon. After its disappearance, several bright particles and a faint light, like a comet's tail, were seen. This observation provides valuable information about the appearance and behavior of meteors during that time.'
