tldr: 'The article discusses the development and significance of the theory of resonance in chemistry. The author, Linus Pauling, explains how the concept of resonance was developed from Heisenberg's quantum-mechanical theory and its application to the hydrogen molecule. The theory of resonance has been used to explain the observed equivalence of chemical bonds, the discovery of the alpha helix and other protein structures, and has become a fundamental part of chemistry education and practice.'
