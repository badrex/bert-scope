tldr: The authors develop a general theory for superlattices with long-range interactions, applicable to equal and unequal concentrations of components. They focus on interaction energies that decrease with distance and work out the important case of inverse power law interactions for cubic crystal lattices. The study helps in understanding the configurational partition function and superlattice order, which are essential for solving the problem of superlattices.
