tldr: The authors conducted a comprehensive study on topochemical reactions and solid-state polymerization, examining eleven substituted diolefins and their ease of polymerization based on crystallographic properties. They discovered that certain crystalline organic monomers can be smoothly converted into extended-chain polymers or oligomers in a diffusionless manner due to the favorable packing of monomer units within the parent crystal. The study offers insights into the design of monomeric entities that can be 'engineered' to pack in specific photolabile forms.
