tldr: The author describes a simple and efficient process to eliminate arsenic and antimony from bismuth through fusion. The method involves heating the arsenical bismuth to a specific temperature, causing the arsenic to sublimate and separate from the bismuth. The author also discusses the separation of antimony from bismuth using a similar process, resulting in a transparent glass-like substance containing a small amount of bismuth. This method reduces the labor, skill, and loss of bismuth involved in traditional purification processes.
