tldr: This study investigates the rapid onset of rigor mortis in animals dying from insulin-induced or thyroid feeding-induced hypoglycemia. The researchers found that the rapid onset is not due to insulin or hypoglycemia, but is directly related to the exhaustion of glycogen in the muscles. The study also shows that the rigor mortis in these cases is more rapid and less intense than in normal animals.
