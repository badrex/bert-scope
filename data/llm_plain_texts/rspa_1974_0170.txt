tldr: The nitrogen isotope mixing reaction on polycrystalline metal wires was studied to understand the catalytic mechanism. The researchers found that the reaction types for tungsten, molybdenum, and rhenium wires had different pressure dependencies and activation energies. The study provides insights into the adsorption behavior and the role of surface science in catalysis.
