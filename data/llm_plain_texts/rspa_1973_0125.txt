tldr: This article investigates the effects of adding and removing cross-links in rubber elasticity under different strains. The authors use Edwards's equilibrium theory to study the network elasticity and compare it with other theories based on classical rubber elasticity. They find that the free energy of the rubber depends on the number of cross-links and the strain, and that memory effects occur when cross-links are added or removed.
