tldr: The article investigates the response of ion channels in murine erythroleukemia cells to fibronectin-integrin interaction. The study shows that cell adhesion to fibronectin promotes plasma membrane hyperpolarization by activating potassium channels, which are similar to calcium-dependent potassium channels. This activation occurs even at a distance from the adhesion site, suggesting a complex regulatory pathway between fibronectin-integrin binding and potassium channel activation.
