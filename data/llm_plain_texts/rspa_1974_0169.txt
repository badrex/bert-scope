tldr: This article studies the behavior of radio waves in the ionosphere when two coupling points approach coalescence. The authors identify two types of coalescence, called coalescences of the first kind (Cl) and of the second kind (C2). They explain how these coalescences are important in various phenomena, such as partial penetration and reflexion, the Ellis window, and limiting polarization. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the equations governing these coalescences and their applications.
