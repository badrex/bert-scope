tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the density of solid mercury using a specific-gravity flask and freezing mixtures. They found that the density of solid mercury at a definite temperature is 14.67 grams per cubic centimeter. This research aimed to improve the accuracy of previous experiments and provide a more reliable value for the density of solid mercury.
