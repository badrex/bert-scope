tldr: The author, J. Norman Lockyer, conducted research on the sun's spectrum using spectroscopy. He created maps of the spectra of calcium, barium, and strontium, and discussed the method of mapping and the wave-lengths of new lines. The study aimed to secure the cooperation of other observers and improve the understanding of the solar spectrum.
