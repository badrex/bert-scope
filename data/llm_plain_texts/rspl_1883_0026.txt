tldr: The author examines the structure and function of the eyes of arthropods, identifying three distinct forms: the Compound eye, the Simple Ocellus, and the Compound Ocellus. They describe the anatomy of each type, including the Dioptron and Neuron structures, and explain how they work together to create vision. The author also discusses the role of refractive media, such as the oil-like fluid found in the Great Rods, and the subcorneal lens in the eyes of Isopods.
