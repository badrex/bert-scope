tldr: The authors conducted a detailed study of the products formed when hydrogen atoms react with propylene. They found that methane, ethane, ethylene, propane, and isobutane are the main products. A proposed mechanism accounts for the reaction, with the formation of vibrationally excited species being the predominant primary process. Novel processes are also identified, and rate constant ratios are evaluated, allowing the calculation of absolute rate constants for individual reactions.
