tldr: The authors developed a generalized mathematical model for the autoignition of hydrocarbons under high-pressure and temperature conditions, similar to those found in rapid-compression machines. The model, based on a degenerate-branched-chain mechanism, simulates the essential phenomena of two-stage autoignition, cool flames, and ignition behavior observed in various hydrocarbon fuels. This model provides a foundation for understanding knock in internal combustion engines and optimizing engine design and operation.
