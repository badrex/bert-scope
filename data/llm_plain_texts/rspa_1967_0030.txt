tldr: The authors conducted experiments in the 1-3 mm wavelength range to study the Moon's surface and its environment. They discovered that the brightness temperature varies throughout a lunation and during eclipse, which is not consistent with models of a thin dust layer on the lunar surface. The results, along with measurements at other wavelengths, will be used to create a rough model for the Moon's surface. The authors suggest using high altitude sites and telescopes with etalons to improve the accuracy of future measurements.
