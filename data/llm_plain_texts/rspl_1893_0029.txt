tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the thickness of thin liquid films using optical and electrical methods. They found that the specific resistance of a film is not affected by its tenuity when the solution contains 3% of potassium nitrate. However, when the proportion of dissolved salt is reduced, the thickness of a black film increases significantly. The study also showed that the specific conductivity of a film increases as the thickness decreases, and this increase is less when salt is added to the solution.
