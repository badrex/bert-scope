revised_title: Creep Behavior of Sphere-Cylinder Shell Intersections: Design Implications
semantic_tags:
  - Creep deformation
  - High-temperature design
  - Pressure vessel components
  - Stress analysis
  - Material deterioration
tldr: This article investigates the creep behavior of sphere-cylinder shell intersections subjected to internal pressure, focusing on the deformation and rupture behavior. The study aims to develop a rational and simple design procedure for high-temperature components, considering factors like stress concentration, strain limitation, and material deterioration. The findings can be applied to the design of various pressure vessel components operating in the creep range.
