tldr: The authors conducted photoelectric measurements to determine the luminous efficiency of daylight. They used L. A. Jones's green filter to adjust the selenium rectifier cell's sensitivity curve to match the human eye. The results showed that daylight has a higher luminous efficiency than artificial light sources, with sky light ranging from 48 to 158 lumens per watt and sunlight from 35 to 120 lumens per watt.
