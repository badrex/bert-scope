tldr: This study presents vacuum wavelength measurements in the ultra-violet spectrum of iron, using a simple Schuler tube and a reflecting echelon. The authors found close agreement with the accepted International Astronomical Union (I.A.U.) standards and determined that the reflecting echelon is superior to the Fabry-Perot for wavelength determinations in vacuum.
