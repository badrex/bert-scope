tldr: This article discusses the simple group of order 25920 through a geometrical approach, focusing on projective geometry and collineations. The author establishes the existence of an Abelian group of collineations of order 2 and a configuration of points, lines, and planes that is invariant for these collineations. The article also explores the properties of this group and its connection to projective transformations of order 2.
