tldr: This article explores the role of memory in ecological systems using a cellular automaton model of a middle European beech forest mosaic. It demonstrates the importance of memory in the evolution of local and global pattern formation and introduces techniques to characterize the dynamics and patterns generated by cellular automata and coupled map lattice models. The study also highlights the concept of transience in ecological systems and its impact on spatial structure and behavior.
