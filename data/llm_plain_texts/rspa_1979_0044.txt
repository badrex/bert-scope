tldr: The authors study the oscillations of a gravitating and rotating uniform liquid sphere, deriving an analytic solution for the bodily tide. They find that dilatationless oscillations are restricted by a selection rule, and in the case of n=2, there exists an inertial type free oscillation with a period close to a day. The effect of rotation on Love numbers is slight for models where the centrifugal acceleration is small compared to the acceleration of gravity at the surface. Additionally, sono-gravitational free oscillations exist in which the dilatation does not vanish, with periods less than an hour.
