tldr: The study examines the effects of cutting the axon of the fast extensor tibiae (FETi) motoneuron in locusts, observing changes in the excitatory post-synaptic potentials (e.p.s.ps) and the loss of synaptic inputs to the motoneuron during the retrograde degeneration process. The results provide insights into the physiological changes in locust motoneurons and their synaptic connections.
