tldr: The author explores the Riemann-Siegel expansion for the zeta function, a method for calculating Riemann's function on the critical line with high accuracy. The expansion is derived using elementary formal manipulations of the Dirichlet series and is found to be divergent, with high orders having a familiar factorial divided by power dependence. The author estimates the dependence of the truncation error on the order of truncation and determines the ultimate accuracy that can be obtained with the method.
