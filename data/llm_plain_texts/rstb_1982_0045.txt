tldr: 'The Amoco Cadiz oil spill in 1978 caused significant mortality and long-term effects on marine populations and ecosystems. The immediate impact led to demographic imbalances and community shifts, while delayed effects on growth, mortality, and recruitment were observed up to 3 years after the spill. Species with short life cycles and high colonizing efficiency tend to replace those with longer life cycles. The recovery process for affected populations and ecosystems may take several generations and up to 60 years for some species, such as seabirds.'
