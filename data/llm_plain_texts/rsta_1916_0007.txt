tldr: This paper explores the possible existence of a temperature coefficient in the law of gravitation and presents experiments conducted to discover this coefficient. The author discusses the challenges of conducting experiments at various temperatures and analyzes previous research on gravitation to determine the potential influence of temperature on the Newtonian constant. The results suggest a positive temperature coefficient of around 1/1000 for a 1Â°C increase in temperature.
