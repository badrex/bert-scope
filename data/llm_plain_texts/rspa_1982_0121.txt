tldr: The authors study the motion of an obstacle in an unbounded, rapidly rotating fluid and the inertial waves it generates. They find that the obstacle causes an inertial-wave disturbance above and behind it, which spreads downstream with increasing vertical distance. The disturbance is constrained within a wedge-shaped region. The authors also explore the effects of viscosity on the disturbance and how it damps out the disturbance on a vertical scale. Inertial waves in rapidly rotating fluids are an essential aspect of geophysical and astrophysical flows.
