tldr: This study investigates the effects of wall oscillations and entry eddies on the breakdown of laminar flow in an annular pipe. Experiments were conducted with water flowing through pipes of annular cross-section, considering oscillations of the inner wall, wall rotation, and entry eddies. The results provide insight into the onset of turbulence and the critical Reynolds numbers for each type of disturbance.
