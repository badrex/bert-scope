tldr: This study investigates the epibiota and attachment substrata of six deep-water brachiopods from Antarctica and New Zealand. It examines how epibiotic communities vary in prevalence, cover, and diversity with depth and explores the substrata to which brachiopods are attached, analyzing their importance to deep-water brachiopod abundance and distribution.
