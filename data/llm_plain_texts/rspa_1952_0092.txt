tldr: The authors investigate the relationship between the rigorous vector theory and the approximate scalar theory of optical imaging. They justify the use of a single scalar wave-function for calculating intensity in a wide class of optical instruments, finding that the main reason for the validity of the scalar theory is the nearly constant properties of monochromatic components over geometrical wave fronts.
