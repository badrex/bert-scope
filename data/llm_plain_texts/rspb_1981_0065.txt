revised_title: 'Induction of Action Potentials in Frog Slow Muscle Fibres Paralysed by α-Bungarotoxin'

tldr: The authors discovered that frog slow muscle fibres, which are normally incapable of generating action potentials, can acquire this ability after being paralyzed by α-bungarotoxin. This suggests that non-quantal acetylcholine leaking from nerve terminals may repress the action potential mechanism in slow muscle fibres.
