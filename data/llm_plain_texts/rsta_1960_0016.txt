tldr: The authors investigate the stability of flow in a rotating, viscous, incompressible fluid subjected to differential heating. They find that a parameter called the Rossby number, which measures the ratio of the fluid's rotation to its buoyancy, plays a critical role in determining the type of flow. Two sets of critical values of this parameter are found, which bound the range over which wave motion is possible. The results are in agreement with experimental observations and have implications for understanding atmospheric circulation patterns.
