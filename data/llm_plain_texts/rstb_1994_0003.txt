tldr: The article discusses the impact of spatial scale and patchiness on population dynamics in terrestrial environments. It distinguishes between resource patches and habitat patches, and explores how movements between these patches influence ecological interactions and population stability. The author also outlines various modeling approaches to metapopulation dynamics, emphasizing the importance of considering spatial locations in these models.
