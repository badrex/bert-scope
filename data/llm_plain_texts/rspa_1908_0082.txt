tldr: The author investigates the reflection of waves from a medium with gradually varying properties, focusing on sound waves. They develop a mathematical model to analyze the reflection and transmission of waves in such media, which can be applied to understand the behavior of sound waves in real-world scenarios, such as through fog or other varying environments.
