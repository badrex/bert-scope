tldr: The authors analyze the temporal behavior of lagrangian acceleration and strain rate in homogeneous isotropic turbulence using direct numerical simulations. Contrary to the long-accepted paradigm of persistent strain, they find that turbulent straining is not persistent. Instead, they propose a new paradigm where small-scale quantities containing directional information have short timescales, while amplitudes have longer timescales that increase with Reynolds number. This study provides a better understanding of the behavior of fluid particles in turbulent flows.
