tldr: The authors studied the electrical conductivities of various salts in water-ethyl alcohol solutions. They found that the conductivities follow the fluidity of the solvent up to a certain point, but diverge in higher proportions of alcohol. The mixed solvents were found to be better ionizing media than pure solvents, and Onsager's equation was more accurate in predicting the conductivities in mixed solvents.
