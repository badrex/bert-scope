tldr: The author, David Brewster, investigates the colors produced by mixed plates, a phenomenon discovered by Dr. Thomas Young. He uses various substances, such as the white of an egg, to create thin films with cavities that produce complementary colors. Brewster also explores the effects of diffraction and interference in thin films, leading to a better understanding of color formation.
