tldr: John Bartram, a physician, discovered a cluster of small teeth at the root of each fang in a rattle-snake's head during a dissection. He hypothesized that these teeth might serve as a backup defense mechanism if the main fangs were damaged. This observation could have implications for understanding the evolution and anatomy of venomous snakes.
