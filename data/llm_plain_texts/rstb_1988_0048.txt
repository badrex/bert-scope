tldr: Researchers have made progress in cloning the cystic fibrosis gene by using genetic linkage analysis with DNA markers. They have assigned the cystic fibrosis locus to chromosome 7's long arm, within the region of band q31. By isolating new probes from the 7q31 region, they aim to create a fine genetic and physical map for the chromosomal region surrounding the cystic fibrosis gene, which will help identify the affected gene and improve understanding of the disease.
