revised_title: Thermal Conductivities of Liquids: A Comprehensive Study
semantic_tags:
  - Thermal conductivity
  - Heat transfer
  - Liquid properties
  - Temperature dependence
  - Experimental methods
tldr: This study investigates the thermal conductivities of various liquids and their temperature dependence. The authors designed a precise apparatus to minimize convection effects and conducted experiments on a range of common liquids, such as water, glycerine, and benzene. They also discussed potential sources of error and corrections to be applied to the experimental data.
