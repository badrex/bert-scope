tldr: Maurice de Broglie was a prominent physicist and educator who made significant contributions to the fields of nuclear physics, X-rays, cosmic radiation, and particle physics. He was the first to examine charged particles in an electric field with the ultra-microscope and studied spectra with a revolving crystal. He also worked on discontinuities in absorption and mass-spectra, and was involved in the detection and localization of enemy U-boats during World War I. His experimental work and training of many young scientists greatly influenced the development of physical science.
