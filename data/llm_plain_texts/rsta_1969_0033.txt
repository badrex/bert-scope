tldr: This article explores the existence of solutions for the Dirichlet problem in quasilinear elliptic partial differential equations of second order. It focuses on the role of global barrier functions and invariants to determine the solvability of the problem for various equations and domains. The study includes examples of the minimal surface equation and the equation for surfaces with prescribed mean curvature.
