tldr: This study by Hartridge and Roughton investigates the velocity at which oxygen combines with reduced hemoglobin. They found that the rate of oxygen binding to hemoglobin is influenced by the concentration of oxygen and the presence of other gases, such as carbon monoxide. This research contributes to understanding the respiratory process and the function of hemoglobin in the body.
