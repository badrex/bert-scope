semantic_tags:
  - Ionization
  - Röntgen rays
  - Gas ionization
  - Electric fields
  - Gas velocity
tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments to determine the velocity of ions produced in gases by Röntgen rays. They used a method that involved comparing the ionic velocity with the gas stream velocity in an electric field. The results provided a measure of the relative velocities of the gas and ions, which can be used to determine the velocity of ions in a given electric field.'
