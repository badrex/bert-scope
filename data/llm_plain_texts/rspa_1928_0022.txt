revised_title: 'Experimental Evidence of Cathode Rays Diffraction'
semantic_tags:
  - Wave-Particle Duality
  - Electron Diffraction
  - Crystallography
  - De Broglie Hypothesis
  - X-ray Diffraction
tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate the behavior of cathode rays passing through thin films. They found that cathode rays, like X-rays, exhibit diffraction patterns when passing through crystals, providing experimental evidence supporting the de Broglie hypothesis that particles can exhibit wave-like behavior.
