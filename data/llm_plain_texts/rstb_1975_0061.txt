tldr: The authors investigate the structure, synthesis, and genetic transmission of elongated-chain haemoglobin variants, suggesting that a single base substitution in the alpha-chain termination codon is the most likely molecular basis for these common abnormal haemoglobins. They provide a comprehensive understanding of the molecular pathology of the different forms of alpha-thalassaemia, including the clinical associations and distribution of these variants.
