tldr: The study found that the European free-tailed bat, Tadarida teniotis, uses low-frequency echolocation calls to detect and feed on large tympanate insects, such as moths and lacewings. This adaptation allows the bat to have a longer detection range and increases the availability of these insects as prey. The results support the allotonic frequency hypothesis, which suggests that using low-frequency echolocation calls is an adaptation to overcome the hearing abilities of tympanate insects.
