tldr: The authors developed a new method to measure high osmotic pressures using a porcelain tube and a surrounding vessel. They filled the porcelain tube with water and the surrounding vessel with the solution, then noted the rate at which the water level in a graduated tube moved while increasing pressure on the solution. This method allowed them to determine osmotic pressures in concentrated solutions more accurately.
