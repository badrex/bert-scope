tldr: The author, P. Collinson, examines large fossil teeth found near the river Ohio and compares them to elephant teeth from Africa and Asia. He concludes that these teeth belong to a previously unknown species of elephant or a massive, vegetarian animal. The grinding teeth are different from any other known animal and suggest that the creature was designed to break off branches and shrubs for sustenance.
