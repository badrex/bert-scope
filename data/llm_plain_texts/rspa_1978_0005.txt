tldr: The authors study the linear and nonlinear stability of convection in a two-dimensional box with free, isothermal horizontal boundaries and rigid, perfect insulator vertical boundaries. They find that the onset of convection is smooth and the concept of a sharp bifurcation at a critical Rayleigh number is no longer valid. The study considers the effects of imperfect insulator sidewalls and the limit of a very long box.
