tldr: The Kolar Gold Fields neutrino experiment studied atmospheric muons and their interactions with cosmic rays at a depth of 7000 hg cm. The experiment recorded muons of atmospheric origin and analyzed their intensity and angular distribution. The results provided insights into the depth-intensity curve and the energy of atmospheric muons, contributing to the understanding of neutrino interactions and atmospheric physics.
