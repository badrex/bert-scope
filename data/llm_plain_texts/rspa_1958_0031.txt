tldr: This study examines the correlation between daily weather conditions and the supply of chloride, sulfate, and other ions to freshwaters from atmospheric precipitation in the English Lake District. The research finds that atmospheric pollution, particularly from the south-east, supplies much of the sulfate in rain, while sea spray from the south-west provides sodium and chloride ions. The study also highlights the importance of daily weather conditions, such as wind direction, velocity, and temperature, on the supply of ions to natural waters like bog pools, upland tarns, and soil solutions.
