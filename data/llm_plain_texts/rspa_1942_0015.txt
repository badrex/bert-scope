tldr: The authors extend the statistical mechanics of condensing systems to a mixture of an arbitrary number of gases. They derive strict equations for chemical equilibrium in a gas mixture and show that, for small pressures, these equations reduce to the law of mass action. This work is significant in understanding chemical equilibrium in multi-component systems.
