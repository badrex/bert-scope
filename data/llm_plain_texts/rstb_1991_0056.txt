tldr: The discovery of a new Late Triassic bird fossil from Texas provides insights into the anatomy, evolution, and phylogenetic relationships of early birds. The fossil, which is about 225 million years old, reveals that the Texas species is more closely related to other birds than to any known group of archosaurs. The bird's skull is lightly built, with a large orbit and expanded temporal region, and its neurosensory specializations suggest that it was a visually oriented predator. This Triassic bird extends the known avian record back at least 75 million years and documents an early stage in the evolution of modern birds.
