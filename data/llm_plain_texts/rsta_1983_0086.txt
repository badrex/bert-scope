tldr: This article discusses the challenges and prospects for understanding the values of fundamental constants in physics. The author explores the role of gauge couplings, scalar masses, and self-couplings in determining these constants and their implications for our understanding of elementary particles and the forces between them. The author also touches upon the possibility of new physics at the Planck scale and the need for a consistent theory of quantum mechanics and relativity.
