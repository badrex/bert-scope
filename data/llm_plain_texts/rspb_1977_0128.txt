tldr: This article discusses a community welfare program initiated by the Church of Uganda in the Kigezi district to improve the living conditions of the local population. The program, called Christian Rural Service, focused on health, education, agriculture, and other aspects of community life. It operated through a team of dedicated local people who lived among the villagers, helping them to raise their standards of living through self-help schemes. The program was successful in improving literacy rates, providing better access to healthcare, and promoting community development.
