tldr: The authors present two alternative methods, the virial method and the electrostatic method, for calculating molecular energies from approximate wave functions. Both methods avoid the difficulties encountered in the conventional method, providing a simpler approach for non-empirical calculations on complex systems. The electrostatic method focuses on the forces acting on the nuclei of a molecule, resulting in a direct calculation of binding energies and other molecular properties.
