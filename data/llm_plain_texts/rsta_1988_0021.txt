tldr: This article discusses the use of radar and satellite imagery in weather forecasting. The authors describe the development of the FRONTIERS system, which allows forecasters to interact with and analyze radar and satellite images in real-time. This system helps improve the accuracy and speed of weather forecasting, particularly for short-term precipitation predictions.
