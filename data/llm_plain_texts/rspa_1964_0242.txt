tldr: The article discusses the development of an analysis for two-component systems in a modified steady-state condition that can be attained in the ultracentrifuge. The method depends on balancing the sharpening effect due to sedimentation coefficients increasing with dilution and the diffusional spreading. The analysis has been tested with a purified protein and a polydisperse mucopolysaccharide, showing that an approximately steady state can be achieved under certain experimental conditions, providing a sensitive means of detecting impurities and characterizing heterogeneity.
