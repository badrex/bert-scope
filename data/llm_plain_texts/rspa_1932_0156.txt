tldr: This article investigates the elastic limit of metals exposed to tri-axial stress, specifically focusing on soft iron wire. The author conducts experiments using a helical tension spring and applies fluid pressure to test the effect on the elastic limit. The results show that the addition of fluid pressure does not increase the likelihood of elastic breakdown in the material, supporting the shear stress theory of Guest and the strain energy theory of von Mises-Hencky.
