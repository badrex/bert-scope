tldr: The authors studied the basicity of nitrogen atoms in the porphyrin nucleus and how it depends on substituents in the tetrapyrrolic ring. They found that porphyrins have stronger basic properties than previously thought, with two protons being added to the nitrogen atoms in the ring as the pH of an aqueous solution decreases. The research also includes information on uroporphyrin I and mesoporphyrin IX, and discusses the relationship between these values and thermodynamic dissociation constants. The findings led to conclusions about the effect of substituents on basicity and possible structures for free bases and cations.
