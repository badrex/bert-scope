tldr: The author, Charles Wheatstone, conducted experiments to study how the human brain perceives images seen by both eyes. He discovered that even when the images in each eye are very different, the brain can still combine them into a single, coherent image. This challenges the common belief that the single appearance of objects is due to their images falling on corresponding points in the retina. Wheatstone also explored the effects of different image sizes and shapes on binocular perception and reviewed existing theories on the topic.
