tldr: The authors used molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations to study protein denaturation and the interactions between chaotropic agents and proteins. They focused on apomyoglobin and investigated the effects of urea, guanidinium ion, and tetramethylammonium ion on its structure. The results provide a detailed model of a molten globule and help understand the mechanism of protein denaturation by chaotropic agents.
