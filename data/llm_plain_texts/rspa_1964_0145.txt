tldr: The article discusses the theoretical analysis of electron resonance spectra line widths in solutions. It focuses on the effects of anisotropic interactions within molecules and how they cause line broadening. The author presents a method to calculate the average width for a composite resonance line using Redfield's density matrix theory and operator methods. The results confirm previous findings on line broadening in electron resonance spectra.
