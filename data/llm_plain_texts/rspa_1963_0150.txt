tldr: This article investigates the concentration dependence of fluorescence spectra of 1:2-benzanthracene and its derivatives, revealing the formation of excited dimers, or "excimers." The authors discuss the factors that determine the relative quantum yield of excimer fluorescence and explain the different types of crystal fluorescence spectra in terms of excimer formation in the crystal lattice.
