tldr: 'Henry Eeles proposes a new theory for the cause of thunder, suggesting that it is due to electrical fire present in humid vapors in the atmosphere. He explains how this fire can be protruded from clouds, creating the sound of thunder. Eeles also hints at further research on the role of this fire in various natural phenomena, such as the ascent of vapors, reflexion, refraction, and inflexion of light, and in animal life and vegetation.'
