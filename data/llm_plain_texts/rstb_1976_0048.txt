tldr: The Bipolar Botanical Project, conducted in the Arctic and Antarctic regions, aimed to study the processes of primary production in polar environments and the adaptations of indigenous flora. The project revealed differences in growth rates, production, and reproductive strategies of plants in the Arctic and Antarctic regions. The findings have implications for understanding natural and exploited ecosystems and may be useful in breeding crops for higher latitudes or revegetation of similar habitats.
