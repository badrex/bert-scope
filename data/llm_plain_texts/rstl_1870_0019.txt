tldr: The author investigates the chemical effects of high refrangibility rays on gaseous matter, discovering that these rays can cause chemical reactions in gases. The study expands the range of radiant energy as a chemical agent and suggests that solar radiation may have a significant influence on the gases, vapors, and effluvia of our atmosphere.
