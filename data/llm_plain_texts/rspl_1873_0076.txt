revised_title: 'On the Forces Caused by Evaporation and Condensation at a Surface'
semantic_tags:
  - Thermodynamics
  - Surface Forces
  - Evaporation
  - Condensation
  - Kinetic Theory of Gases
tldr: The author explains the forces caused by evaporation and condensation at a surface using the kinetic theory of gases. They demonstrate that evaporation creates a force that pushes the surface back, while condensation creates a force that pulls the surface forward. The experiments show that these effects are due to the change in pressure caused by the molecules of the liquid or gas interacting with the surface.
