tldr: The authors developed a method for creating diffraction gratings by generating helical rulings and transferring them to plane surfaces. They eliminated periodic errors in helical gratings and demonstrated how to control the distribution of diffracted energy. This method improved the accuracy and quality of plane gratings, making them suitable for spectroscopic use.
