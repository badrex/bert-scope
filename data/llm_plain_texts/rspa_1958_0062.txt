tldr: The article discusses the moment problem, which involves determining the set of all real sequences that have non-decreasing functions as solutions. The author presents a general approach to solving this problem, covering various types of moment problems and providing a comprehensive theory that generalizes and simplifies previous results. The study focuses on moments of non-negative mass and the conditions under which a point can admit mass.
