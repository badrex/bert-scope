tldr: The study describes the ultrastructure of spermatogenesis in the tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus), a primitive reptile, for the first time. It identifies the different stages of spermatid development and the unique features of testicular and epididymal spermatozoa. The findings suggest that the Sphenodontida are primitive amniotes, with turtles having fewer spermatozoal apomorphies.
