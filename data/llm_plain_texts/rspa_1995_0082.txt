tldr: The author investigates a two-dimensional complex holomorphic system and its generalization, focusing on the behavior of phase paths near an equilibrium point with a single purely imaginary eigenvalue. Using center manifold theory and Briot-Bouquet theory, the author establishes a center theorem that describes the existence of a family of concentric closed orbits surrounding the equilibrium point. This theorem is then generalized to n-dimensional holomorphic systems, providing insights into the dynamics of complex systems in telecommunications and other fields.
