tldr: A young woman received a corneal wound in her eye, which led to inflammation and blurred vision. Mr. Thomas Baker, a surgeon, treated the wound using a combination of bloodletting, eye wash, and a cataplasm. After the slough was cast off, the patient's vision gradually improved, and her eye regained its strength and clarity.
