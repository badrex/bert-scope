tldr: This article presents a new theory for calculating the diamagnetism of a plasma column, taking into account ion motion in a fluid approximation. The theory considers the effects of magnetic fields on electron temperature and electron number density distribution, providing a better agreement between theory and experimental measurements for magnetic fields less than 300 G. The findings can help improve our understanding of plasma behavior and its applications in various fields.
