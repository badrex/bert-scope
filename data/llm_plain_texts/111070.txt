tldr: Augustus Waller's experiments on the section of the glossopharyngeal and hypoglossal nerves of frogs showed that these nerves are responsible for the tongue's motion and sensation. When these nerves are divided, the tongue loses its ability to move and sense. The author also observed changes in the nerve fibers after division, which he attributed to a disruption in nutrition caused by the interruption of the nervous current.
