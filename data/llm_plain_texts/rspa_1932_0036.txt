tldr: The authors developed a method to measure the half-value period of uranium-Y, a radioactive isotope, using a parallel plate condenser and an electrometer. They found that the half-value period was approximately 64 hours and discussed the limitations of using an electroscope for such measurements. This research contributed to the understanding of radioactive decay and the development of nuclear physics.
