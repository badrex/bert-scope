tldr: The authors, Augustus Matthiessen and Carl Vogt, conducted experiments to understand the influence of temperature on the electric conducting-power of alloys. They discovered that the conducting-power of alloys changes significantly with temperature and found a way to calculate the conducting-power at different temperatures. This research helped in understanding the behavior of alloys and their potential applications in various fields.
