tldr: The author investigates the spectra of Antarian stars and discovers a strong resemblance between the fluted spectrum of titanium and the spectra of these stars. They conclude that the main substance responsible for the flutings is titanium or a compound of titanium with oxygen. This research helps to understand the nature of the Antarian stars' spectra and provides insights into the chemical composition of these stars.
