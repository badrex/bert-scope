tldr: The authors conducted ultrasonic studies on the electronic structure of hexagonal metal crystals, specifically magnesium, zinc, and cadmium. They measured the total electronic attenuation of longitudinal ultrasound in these metals at frequencies from 30 to 450 MHz and temperatures down to 0.1 K. The results provided information about the anisotropy of the Fermi surface and its deformation parameters, as well as electron mean free paths. The study found that magnesium is nearly isotropic, while zinc and cadmium are highly anisotropic.
