tldr: The author, John Ellis, conducted experiments to find the best way to preserve seeds during long voyages. He tested various methods, such as using gum arabic, gum senega, beeswax, rosin, and a mixture of pitch, rosin, and beeswax. He found that the best method involved placing seeds in a glass bottle filled with dry sand, then sealing it in a larger glass vessel filled with a moist saline mixture. This method prevented seeds from decaying during long journeys, allowing for the importation of useful plants from around the world.
