tldr: This study investigates the lattice stability of indium-thallium alloys using ultrasonic wave velocities and attenuation. The results reveal that the alloys exhibit lattice mode softening, which is the basis of the martensitic phase transformation. The findings provide insight into the microscopic nature of the transition and the crystal stability of the alloys.
