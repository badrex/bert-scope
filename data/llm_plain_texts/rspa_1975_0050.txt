tldr: The authors conducted a high-resolution study of the A2Σ+-X2Σ electronic transition in the NCO free radical. They analyzed bands involving three vibronic levels and found a new value for the Renner parameter, resolving discrepancies in earlier electron resonance results. This work provides a more accurate understanding of the Renner-Teller effect in linear molecules.
