tldr: The author, Arthur Bayly, shares observations made by a ship's master crossing the equator in 1684. The observations involve the behavior of a compass needle in relation to a piece of iron held in different positions. The findings show that the compass needle's orientation changes when the iron is held horizontally, but not when held vertically. This information could be useful for navigation and shipbuilding.
