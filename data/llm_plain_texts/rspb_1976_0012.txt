tldr: This article discusses how shade-tolerant woodland species can compensate for low seed production by using vegetative modes of propagation. It provides evidence that these species can spread rapidly through vegetative means, allowing them to survive and increase in low light conditions. The degree of emphasis on seed production or vegetative spread may depend on the climate, and these modes of increase can help maintain species through later phases of plant succession.
