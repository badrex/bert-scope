tldr: The author investigates the concentration of certain elements, such as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, chlorine, bromine, and boron, at the Earth's surface. They find that these elements are highly concentrated in ocean water and sedimentary rocks compared to weathered igneous rocks. The author also discusses the volatility of elements at high temperatures and their solubility in water, which may have played a role in their concentration at the Earth's surface.
