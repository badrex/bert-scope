tldr: This article describes the autopsy findings of a 72-year-old man who died of asthma. The right kidney had two large water-filled bladders on its surface, while the left kidney was smaller and its ureter was contorted. The bladder contained unusual-shaped stones. The stomach was slightly redder than usual, and the lungs were smaller due to the accumulation of water. The pleura membrane was thickened by the serum, and the valves of the left ventricle of the heart were petrified.
