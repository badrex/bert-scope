tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the reactions and properties of muriatic and oxymuriatic acids. They found that the amount of hydrogen gas evolved from muriatic acid remains constant regardless of exposure to muriate of lime. The author also discovered that the presence of mercury affects the results of experiments involving muriatic acid. The findings contribute to the understanding of the composition and behavior of these acids.
