tldr: This article presents a rare case study of a woman who suffered from extreme fragility, flexibility, and dissolution of her bones. Despite various treatments, her condition worsened, and she eventually passed away. After her death, an examination revealed that her bones were soft and dissolved, with some parts being as thin as eggshells. The cause of this condition remains unclear, but it is believed that the marrow may have played a role in the dissolution process.
