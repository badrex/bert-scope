tldr: This article discusses various exact relationships in two-dimensional elasticity that are useful for studying effective elastic constants and stress fields in two-dimensional composite materials. The authors explore the theorem by Cherkaev, Lurie, and Milton, which shows that the effective Young's modulus of a sheet containing holes is independent of the Poisson's ratio of the matrix material. They also demonstrate how this theorem can be applied to composites with different geometries and material properties.
