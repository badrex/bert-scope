tldr: 'This article discusses the experiments that proved the collinearity of the genetic map with the polypeptide chain. Two groups of researchers demonstrated this by studying the A protein of the tryptophan synthetase of Escherichia coli and the head gene of bacteriophage T4. These experiments established the sequence hypothesis and provided evidence for the one-dimensional encoding and translation of genetic information. The article also explores the general nature of the genetic code and its structure, including the discovery of the degenerate, triplet code and the sequential reading of codons.'
