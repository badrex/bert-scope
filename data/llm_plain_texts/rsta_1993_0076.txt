tldr: This article explores the microbial mineralization of organic matter and the mechanisms of self-organization in the formation of diagenetic minerals, specifically carbonate concretions. The authors discuss two contrasting examples: Jurassic marine mudrock with pyrite-rimmed calcite concretions and Carboniferous non-marine mudrock with extensive siderite cemented beds. They propose a quantitative model for one example, which is validated using present-day pore-water chemistry measurements, allowing for the calculation of concretion growth duration. The study provides insights into the biogeochemical processes involved in concretion formation and their implications for reservoir quality and pore-water evolution.
