tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine how various substances affect the freezing point of water. They found that common salt lowers the freezing point in a simple ratio, while nitre has a unique effect of raising the freezing point when cooled below its saturation point. The author also observed interesting crystal formations and properties in these solutions.
