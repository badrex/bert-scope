tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the coefficient of diffusion of lactic acid through muscle fibers. They discovered that the diffusion constant decreases with increasing lactic acid concentration, suggesting that muscle fatigue is caused by a decrease in the relative volume of lymph spaces between muscle fibers. The findings provide insight into the mechanisms of muscle fatigue and the role of lactic acid in muscle function.
