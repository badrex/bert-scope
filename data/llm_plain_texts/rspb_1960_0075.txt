tldr: The authors discuss the dispersal and endemism of marine fauna in the southern cold temperature zone, focusing on the Antarctic and Subantarctic regions. They explore the factors affecting colonization and the role of the Subtropical Convergence as an isolating mechanism. The authors also highlight the need for further research on the life histories of species and the importance of increased knowledge of marine flora and fauna in the Antarctic.
