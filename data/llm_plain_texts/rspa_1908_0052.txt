tldr: The authors conducted photographic observations to determine the elements of the orbits of Jupiter's satellites. They used both the heliometer and photographic telescope methods to measure the positions of the satellites and compared their accuracy. The results provided valuable information about the orbits and the motion of the nodes, which can help in understanding the compression of Jupiter. This study highlights the importance of photographic observations in determining the positions of celestial bodies and their orbits.
