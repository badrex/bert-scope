tldr: The author conducted experiments on Antirrhinum majus plants to study the inheritance of flower colors. They discovered that the inheritance of corolla colors can be represented by factors, following the Mendelian inheritance. The five distinguishable types of flower colors are white, yellow, ivory, magenta, and crimson, with different combinations of factors determining each color. The study provides insights into the genetics of plant breeding and the inheritance of traits.
