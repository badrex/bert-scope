tldr: The author presents an optical method using interferometry to measure the thickness of adsorbed monolayers on solid surfaces. They demonstrate the technique using stearic acid and octacosanoic acid layers, finding uniform thicknesses of 19A and 30A, respectively. This method provides direct evidence of the properties of molecular layers adsorbed on solid surfaces and can be used to study the types of films that affect frictional properties.
