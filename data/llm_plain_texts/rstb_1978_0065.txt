tldr: This article explores the evolution of bivalve molluscs, specifically the pelecypods, and their early taxonomic diversification during the Ordovician period. The author examines a series of Cambrian forms that show morphological transitions between rostroconchs, helcionellacean monoplacophorans, and the earliest known pelecypod, Fordilla troyensis. The study also discusses the first major radiation of pelecypods in Ordovician time, identifying at least seven subclasses and suggesting that the Heterodonta may be polyphyletic.
