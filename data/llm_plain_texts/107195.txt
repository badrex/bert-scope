tldr: James Smithson discovered native minium, a new species of lead ore, found in the earth and mixed with a compact carbonate of zinc. The minium has a red color and specific chemical properties, such as reducing to lead on charcoal and dissolving in marine acid with gold. This discovery adds to the understanding of mineral composition and ore properties.
