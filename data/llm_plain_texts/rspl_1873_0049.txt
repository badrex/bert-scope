tldr: The author conducted a study on the uteri of nine women who had died during different stages of their monthly period. They observed the structure and changes in the mucous membrane and concluded that menstruation consists of growth and rapid decay of the mucous membrane. The menstrual discharge is mainly blood and debris of the uterine mucous membrane, with the source of bleeding being the vessels of the uterus body. A new mucous membrane is then developed by the proliferation of the uterine wall's inner layer.
