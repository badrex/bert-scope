tldr: This article discusses the lunar variations of magnetic declination observed at Bombay between 1861 and 1863. The author finds that the mean lunar-diurnal variation has a small range compared to other lunar-diurnal variations with different sun and moon positions. The study also explores the possibility of observing a faint solar appendage during lunar-solar eclipses and the zodiacal light's spectrum.
