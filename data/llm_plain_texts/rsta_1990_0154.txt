tldr: The authors present a new method of using the Auger parameter to analyze the chemical states of metal and oxide surface layers. This method can be used to characterize ultra-thin films and provide unique chemical information on the top 10 nm of the surface. The Auger parameter is related to extra atomic relaxation and polarization energies of the element, which can be used to study the electronic distribution in various materials, such as catalyst structures and inhomogeneous oxide layers on metallic alloy substrates.
