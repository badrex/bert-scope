tldr: The authors conducted experiments to compare the effects of choline, neurine, muscarine, and beta on isolated nerve and excised heart. They found that neurine and muscarine had significant effects on nerve and heart function, while choline had a less powerful action. The study helped to understand the actions of these substances on the nervous system and their potential applications in medicine.
