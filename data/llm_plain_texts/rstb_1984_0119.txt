tldr: 'The article discusses the role of red cell sialoglycoproteins, specifically glycophorins, in the invasion of human red cells by merozoites of Plasmodium falciparum. The authors found that red cells deficient in glycophorins resist infection by the parasite to varying degrees, suggesting that these molecules play a crucial role in the invasion process. The study also explores the interaction between merozoites and red cell receptors, and the potential use of these receptors in the search for potential plasmodial immunogens.'
