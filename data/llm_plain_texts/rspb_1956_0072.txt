tldr: The author discusses the phenomenon of immunological tolerance in birds, specifically focusing on the suppression of agglutinin formation. They explore the effects of embryonic parabiosis, intravenous injection of heterologous blood, and immune agglutinin formation in various bird species. The study reveals that immunological tolerance can be achieved through these methods, leading to a better understanding of the immune system in birds.
