tldr: This article presents a density matrix formalism to explain various coherence effects observed in double resonance experiments. It demonstrates how the intensity of resonance light can be modulated at specific frequencies due to radio-frequency fields inducing transitions between Zeeman sublevels. The author applies this method to the case of the even isotopes of mercury, showing how it can be used to predict resonance positions and shapes, and calculate re-emitted light intensities.
