tldr: The authors conducted calculations on the angular distribution and total collision cross-section for high-energy neutron-proton scattering. They used Born's approximation and investigated various shapes and ranges of the interaction potential. The results showed that the total collision cross-section and angular distribution depend on the shape and range of the interaction, with Yukawa potentials providing a better fit for the scattering data.
