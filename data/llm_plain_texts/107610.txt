tldr: The author conducted experiments on the aeriform compounds of charcoal and hydrogen, focusing on the gases obtained from coal and oil. They discovered that these gases have varying specific gravities, combustibility, and illuminating power. The author also investigated the properties and composition of carburetted hydrogen gas, which is formed through the decomposition of water. This gas has important implications for understanding the chemical reactions and analysis of mixed combustible gases.
