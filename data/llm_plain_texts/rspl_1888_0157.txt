tldr: This article presents a magnetic survey of the British Isles conducted by A. W. Rucker and T. E. Thorpe. The authors discuss previous magnetic surveys and explain the methods used in their own survey. They provide an account of the magnetic observations taken between 1834-38 and 1857-62, and the results were reduced to the epoch 1842-5 by Sir E. Sabine. The authors also mention their own survey conducted between 1884-88, which aimed to determine declination and the force of the Earth's magnetic field at various locations in the British Isles.
