tldr: This study investigates the hot-spot ignition mechanisms for explosives and propellants, focusing on various processes that convert mechanical or electrical energy into thermal energy. The authors explore different experimental techniques, such as high-speed photography, instrumented drop-weight apparatus, miniaturized Hopkinson bar, Brazilian test, and laser speckle photography, to understand the response of explosives to stress and impact, and the production of hot spots. They discuss various ignition mechanisms, including adiabatic shear, cavity collapse, friction, and triboluminescent discharge, and their practical implications.
