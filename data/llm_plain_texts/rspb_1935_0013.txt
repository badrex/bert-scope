tldr: This study investigates the effects of hypophysectomy on pregnancy and lactation in ferrets. The results show that hypophysectomy at 21 days of pregnancy leads to termination of gestation, while hypophysectomy at 35 days of pregnancy results in premature or stillbirths. The mammary glands of hypophysectomized ferrets do not develop properly, and lactation fails to occur. The study highlights the importance of the pituitary gland in regulating pregnancy and lactation in ferrets.
