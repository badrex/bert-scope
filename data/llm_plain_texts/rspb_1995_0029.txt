tldr: This study investigates the role of perceptual biases in the evolution of intraspecific signals and develops an artificial neural network technique to model situations where multiple types of responses are required. The results show that signals tend to evolve towards converse forms, even when processed through the same network, suggesting that general biases in recognition mechanisms may be responsible for this effect.
