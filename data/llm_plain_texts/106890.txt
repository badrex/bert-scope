tldr: 'In this article, William Herschel presents a series of observations and calculations to determine the rotation period of Saturn and its ring system. He carefully documents the changes in the planet's belts and the ring's shadow, concluding that the rotation period has a considerable degree of exactness. The observations and findings contribute to a better understanding of Saturn's rotation and the properties of its ring system.'
