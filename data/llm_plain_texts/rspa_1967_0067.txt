tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the effects of foreign gas pressures on the intensity distribution in a spectral line of calcium. They used a high-resolution grating spectrograph to study the broadening and shift of the calcium line when perturbed by helium, neon, argon, and krypton. The results showed a linear variation of both broadening and shift with perturbing particle density, as predicted by the Lindholm impact theory. However, a quantitative interpretation demands the use of an interaction potential between radiating and perturbing atoms containing both attractive and repulsive components.
