tldr: The author, George Biddell Airy, conducted a study comparing magnetic disturbances recorded by self-registering magnetometers at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, with magnetic disturbances deduced from corresponding terrestrial galvanic currents recorded by self-registering galvanometers. The study aimed to understand the relationship between these phenomena and their impact on practical telegraphic operations. The author established two lines of insulated wires from the Royal Observatory to stations near Dartford and Croydon, allowing for the recording of galvanic currents and their effects on magnetic elements. The findings showed that atmospheric influences had no effect on the records, and the Croydon currents, which carried most of the terrestrial galvanism, had a different aspect from the Dartford currents.
