tldr: The author investigates the electromotive properties and physiology of the electrical organ of Torpedo marmorata. They discuss previous research on the subject, the anatomy and structure of the organ, and the physiological changes that occur when the organ receives an excitatory nervous impulse. The author also examines the electromotive activity of the organ and its response to electrical excitation, providing insights into the organ's function and potential applications.
