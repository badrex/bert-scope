tldr: The authors prove improvements on the recent work of Sprindžuk, establishing Mahler's conjecture in the theory of transcendental numbers. They show that for almost all real and complex numbers, only a finite number of integers satisfy specific conditions related to polynomial equations and their coefficients. This result has implications in number theory and real and complex analysis.
