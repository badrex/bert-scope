tldr: The article investigates the problem of radiation from a semi-infinite parallel-plate waveguide, terminated by an infinite plane flange (double wedge), in the wide double-wedge case. The problem is reduced to an infinite system of linear equations, and an approximate solution is obtained using the -representation. The diffraction patterns and reflection coefficient are evaluated, and the accuracy and limits of classical diffraction theory are discussed.
