tldr: 'William McFadden Orr was a renowned mathematician and physicist who made significant contributions to the fields of thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, and stability theory. He is best known for his work on the stability of steady liquid flow, which has influenced modern research in aerodynamics and fluid motion. Orr's teaching focused on the logical foundations of thermodynamics, and he authored a small book, "Notes on Thermodynamics," which is a model of precision in formulating principles. Throughout his career, Orr maintained a strong correspondence with many leading mathematicians and physicists of his time, including Sir Joseph Larmor and Lord Rayleigh.'
