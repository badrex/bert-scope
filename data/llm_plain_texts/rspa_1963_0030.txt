tldr: This study investigates the flow behavior of polycrystalline lead under simple shear, using two different methods to measure strain. The researchers found that a law holds with great precision for a lower range of strains, and they examined the metal's behavior under repeated stress reversals. The findings provide insights into the mechanisms of linear flow and the role of slip lines in the metal's properties.
