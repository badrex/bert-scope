tldr: The authors discovered glycogenic fatty degeneration in the blood, a process where excessive glycogen accumulates in the leukocytes. They studied the causes of fatty degeneration in profound anaemias and certain forms of toxaemia, and found that the blood itself can suffer from these conditions. The authors also discussed methods for detecting fatty degeneration in blood samples, such as using formol vapor and Scharlach solution. This research contributes to understanding blood diseases and the role of blood-forming organs.
