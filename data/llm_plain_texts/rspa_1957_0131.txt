revised_title: A Non-Perturbation Method for Non-Linear Field Theories: Applications and Limitations
semantic_tags:
  - Quantum Field Theory
  - Non-Linear Dynamics
  - Renormalization
  - Propagators
  - Meson Theory
tldr: The authors develop a non-perturbation method for approximating field energy and propagators in non-linear field theories, focusing on scalar meson theory. They apply the method to the external source problem, one- and two-meson propagators, and meson-pair theory, demonstrating its effectiveness in certain scenarios but also highlighting potential issues with renormalization and the presence of "ghost states."
