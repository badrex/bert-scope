tldr: This study examines the excretory system of three species of archaeogastropod molluscs, Monodonta lineata, Emarginula reticulata, and Patella vulgata, to understand the differences in their right and left kidneys. The research reveals that the left kidney has a predominantly resorptive role, while the right kidney retains the primitive function of nitrogenous excretion. The findings provide insights into the evolution of the excretory system in gastropods and help clarify the anatomical and ultrastructural organization of the kidneys in these species.
