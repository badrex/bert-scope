tldr: The author investigates the refractive indices of elements, focusing on the relationship between refractivities and atomic weight, valency, and other properties of matter. The study examines the refractive indices of inert gases and halogens, finding a simple numerical relation between them. The author also discusses previous research on refractive indices and the methods used to measure them, comparing and contrasting different approaches.
