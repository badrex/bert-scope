tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the y-rays emitted by actinium emanation. They found that the emanation emitted both a-radiation and a strong y-radiation. Their results supported Gamow's theory that y-rays are a necessary accompaniment of fine structure in a-rays emitted from radioactive substances, and provided evidence that y-rays have their origin in a-ray transformations in an excited nucleus.
