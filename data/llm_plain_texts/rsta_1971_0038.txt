tldr: This article discusses the concepts of steady and unsteady wind loading on buildings and structures, focusing on the characteristics of atmospheric winds, turbulence, and their dependence on terrain. It also explores the design considerations for avoiding aerodynamic instability and the need for further research on wind-tunnel studies and simulating natural winds.
