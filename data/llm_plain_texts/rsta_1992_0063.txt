tldr: The article discusses the development and application of photosensitive caged compounds to aid time-resolved structure determination of macromolecules. These compounds enable dynamic structural analysis of enzyme-catalyzed reactions and protein-ligand interactions by rapidly and efficiently releasing biologically active molecules within crystals. The author presents practical considerations and examples relevant to studies of Ha-ras p21 and glycogen phosphorylase.
