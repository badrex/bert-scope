tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the thermal radiation emitted by platinum wires with different surface textures. They found that the texture of the radiating surface significantly affects the proportion of long and short period vibrations in the emitted radiation. The authors also determined the energy lost by radiation per square centimeter per second in absolute measure.
