tldr: The authors investigate the air-bladder and Weberian ossicles in ninety-two species of Siluridae, belonging to about fifty genera. They describe the morphological variations in these structures and suggest a new nomenclature for the "auditory ossicles" of Weber. The study also highlights the fusion of the second, third, and fourth vertebrae in the formation of the "complex vertebra" in Siluridae.
