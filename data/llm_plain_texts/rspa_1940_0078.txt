tldr: The authors conducted experiments on polymethylene lattices to study the role of lattice flaws in melting. They found that flaws in the crystal structure increase as the temperature rises, and that these flaws break up the crystal into a mosaic of smaller crystalline structures. This process is comparable to a gel-sol transition, and the presence of flaws in the solid state near the melting point is confirmed by freezing-point depressions and cryoscopic heat measurements.
