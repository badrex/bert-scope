tldr: The study investigates the effects of ambient pressure and liquid composition on the dynamics of phase change in multicomponent liquid droplets at their homogeneous nucleation limits. The experiments involve levitating droplets in a flowing stream of another immiscible liquid and inducing bubble nucleation by isothermally decompressing the field liquid. The results show that the vaporization rate and bubble growth within droplets are influenced by pressure and composition, with ternary mixtures exhibiting faster vaporization rates than binary mixtures.
