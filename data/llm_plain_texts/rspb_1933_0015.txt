tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of cane sugar solution on the development of Rana temporaria (European common frog) embryos. They found that exposing the embryos to a 25% cane sugar solution led to various abnormalities, such as short bodies, swollen abdomens, and enlarged mouth cavities. These findings support previous research suggesting that osmotic pressure from the sugar solution affects the development of the embryos. The results also show similarities to the "fancy" races of goldfish, which may be due to similar injury to growing cells caused by toxins in the water.
