tldr: The authors studied the effects of pile radiation on polythene, discovering that it becomes cross-linked and transforms into a new type of plastic. They analyzed weight changes, chemical constitution, solubility, and other properties to understand the relationship between radiation dose and degree of cross-linking. This research has implications for the development of new polymers and materials with controlled properties.
