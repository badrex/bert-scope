tldr: 'Researchers D. Keilin and E. F. Hartree discovered and studied the enzyme cytochrome oxidase, which plays a crucial role in cellular respiration. They found that this enzyme works together with cytochrome to catalyze the oxidation of various compounds, such as diamines and polyphenols. The researchers also named this enzyme "Cytochrome oxidase" based on its function. Their work helped clarify the mechanism of intracellular respiration and the role of enzymes in cellular processes.'
