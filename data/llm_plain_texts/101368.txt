tldr: This article describes the unusual effect of thunder and lightning on wheat and rye stored in granaries in Dantzick. Violent storms caused the stored grain to become clammy and stinking, making it unfit for shipping. The author suggests that this phenomenon is worth further investigation, as it is more complex than the alterations caused by thunder in other substances.
