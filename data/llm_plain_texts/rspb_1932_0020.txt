tldr: The article investigates the effects of inducing ovulation during pregnancy in rabbits using extracts of urine from pregnant women. The study found that inducing ovulation often does not harm the existing fetuses but may cause disturbances in the normal parturition process. Additionally, the corpora lutea formed after induced ovulation have a shorter life history compared to normal corpora lutea of pregnancy, and their presence seems to accelerate the decay of existing corpora lutea.
