tldr: This study examines the effects of air drag and the geopotential on near-circular satellite orbits in an oblate, diurnally varying atmosphere. The authors develop a theoretical framework that combines the effects of atmospheric oblateness, day-to-night density variation, and gravitational perturbations. They use this framework to analyze the behavior of orbital elements and obtain values of atmospheric parameters at altitudes near 400 km. The results can help improve our understanding of satellite motion and the behavior of Earth's atmosphere.
