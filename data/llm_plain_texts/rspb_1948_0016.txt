tldr: The study investigates the histophysiology of the earthworm's alimentary canal, focusing on the process of extrusion from the intestinal glands and other features of the intestinal epithelium. The research examines the roles of ciliated and gland cells in the extrusion process, and suggests a mechanism for extrusion based on the contraction of intracellular fibrils in ciliated cells. The findings provide insights into the earthworm's digestive system and the process of secretion in the intestinal lining.
