tldr: In 1938, the UK government established a Central Register to track professionals for wartime use. The Royal Society took on the task of compiling the scientific research section of the register. They sent out questionnaires to potential participants and filed the completed forms under specific classifications. By October 1939, 6,484 individuals had been registered, and the information gathered provided a valuable census of scientific personnel in Great Britain. This effort was initially for wartime needs but proved useful in peacetime as well.
