tldr: This article investigates the phase boundary potentials of absorbed films on metals, specifically focusing on the behavior of oxygen on gold and platinum surfaces. The authors demonstrate that oxygen is strongly adsorbed onto these metal surfaces, and they develop a method to measure the changes in interfacial potential differences due to surface absorption. They find that the low values recorded in previous studies are likely due to the tenacity with which oxygen is held by the metals, and they discuss the implications of their findings for understanding adsorption and surface reactions.
