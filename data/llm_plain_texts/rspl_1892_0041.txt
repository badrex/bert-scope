tldr: The author examines the human sacrum, its form, and anomalies, and its correlation to other regions of the vertebral column in humans and other mammals. They investigate the sacrum's relation to the spinal nervous system and its ossification. The study is based on a series of 265 adult sacra and numerous fetal vertebral columns. The author concludes that the variations in the sacrum can be explained by inherent variability, and that there is a greater tendency towards increase than diminution in the total number of bones.
