tldr: The author, Donald Monro, describes the discovery of a pure native crystallized natron, or fossil alkaline salt, found in Tripoli, Barbary. He discusses its properties, methods of extraction, and potential uses, including as a medicine, in making glass, and for cleaning and bleaching textiles. The salt is distinct from other alkaline salts and forms unique neutral salts with mineral and vegetable acids.
