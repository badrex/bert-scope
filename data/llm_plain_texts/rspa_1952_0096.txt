tldr: This article discusses the relationship between load and friction in boundary lubrication. The authors found that a coefficient of friction of 0.1 or less can be achieved with a monolayer of stearic acid at low loads. At higher loads, the coefficient of friction becomes irregular, fluctuating between 0.1 and 0.2. The authors suggest that the extent of deformation of the underlying metal during sliding is a primary influence on the breakdown of a boundary film, and that this depends on the macroscopic radius of curvature, hardness, and surface roughness of the sliding members.
