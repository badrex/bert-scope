tldr: Keane Fitz-Gerald proposes a machine design that uses a fire-engine to operate ventilators in mines, improving air circulation and safety. The design increases the number of strokes per minute and allows for constant, one-way rotation of the ventilator wheel. This innovation could also be applied to other mining tasks, such as raising coal or grinding corn.
