tldr: The author investigates the enhanced series of lines in the spectra of alkaline earth elements, focusing on the denominator differences that produce observed separations. They analyze the connections between these series and certain laws previously established, using wave numbers and atomic physics concepts to determine the relationships between the lines. The study provides insights into the behavior of the elements and their spectral properties.
