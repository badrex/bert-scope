tldr: 'This article presents measurements of the surface impedance of normal and superconducting tin at a frequency of 9400 Mc./sec. The experiments reveal a marked anisotropy in the surface impedance, demonstrating the non-tensorial nature of the fundamental equations relating the field vectors. The temperature variation of the resistance and reactance of superconducting tin is also studied, showing that over certain temperature ranges, the shapes of corresponding curves for different specimens are similar, apart from scaling factors depending on the orientation.'
