tldr: The study investigates the surface and deep hydrology of the North Atlantic Ocean over the past 150,000 years, focusing on the abrupt shifts in foraminiferal 8180 associated with the Heinrich events. The research reconstructs the changes in surface and deep-water density, revealing that the North Atlantic Ocean has been a potential area for deep-water formation during the last glacial period.
