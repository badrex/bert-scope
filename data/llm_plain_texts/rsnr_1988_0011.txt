tldr: This article explores the scotoscope, a 17th-century optical device that was possibly a microscope lamp. It discusses its connection to Samuel Pepys, who purchased a microscope and a scotoscope from Richard Reeve, a prominent London perspective maker and glass grinder. The author also examines the possible use of the scotoscope in microscopical observations and its relation to the work of Robert Hooke and Henry Power.
