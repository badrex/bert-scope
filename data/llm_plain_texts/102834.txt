tldr: The author, Dr. John Wallis, discusses the historical connection between England and France through an isthmus that once joined the two countries. He presents evidence from various sources, including the unity of language between the ancient Gauls and Britains, and the discovery of strange teeth and bones in Chartham, which he believes to be remnants of a large marine animal. Wallis also explains the geological formation of the current passage between Dover and Calais, suggesting that the isthmus was worn away by the sea over time.
