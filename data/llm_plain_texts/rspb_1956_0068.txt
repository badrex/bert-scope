tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the phenomenon of immunological tolerance, specifically the inhibition of response to purified protein antigens. They found that injecting newborn rabbits with a protein prevented them from forming antibodies to that protein during adulthood. This phenomenon is linked to the immaturity of the central antibody-forming mechanism and is considered a consequence of acquired immunological tolerance. The results provide insights into understanding the mechanism of immunological tolerance and its role in immunity.
