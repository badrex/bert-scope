tldr: 'Sir Charles Bell's paper discusses the respiratory system of nerves, which he considers both muscular and sensitive. He describes the tract of the spinal cord and its columns, with no decussations. Bell confirms through experiments that the phrenic and spinal accessory nerves are responsible for motion, and he explains the supply of blood to the respiratory system of nerves, which helps explain several pathological phenomena.'
