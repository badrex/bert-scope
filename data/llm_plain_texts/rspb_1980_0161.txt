tldr: This study investigates the behavior of endplate currents in a low ionic strength sucrose solution to examine the effects on the ACh receptor-channel complex. The results show that the muscle fiber membrane retains its ACh sensitivity even in isotonic sucrose, and the major part of the endplate current is carried by K+ ions. The voltage dependence of ACh-induced currents and single channel currents were analyzed, revealing a linear relation at negative membrane potentials and a saturation or decline at positive potentials. This suggests that the number of functional ACh receptors decreases as the endplate is depolarized to more positive potentials.
