tldr: The author investigates the development of the branchial arterial arches in birds, specifically the origin of the subclavian and carotid arteries. They find that the subclavian artery arises from the ventral end of the third arch, and the carotid artery system is derived from the dorsal continuation of the third arch. This research challenges previous theories on the development of these arteries in birds and provides insights into the evolution of the arterial system in vertebrates.
