tldr: This article presents a study on the elastic scattering of fast electrons and positrons by hydrogen and helium atoms. The authors discuss scattering amplitudes for 700 electrons in helium and provide a detailed analysis of the scattering angle and amplitude. Their findings contribute to the understanding of atomic and nuclear physics.
