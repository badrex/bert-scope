tldr: The article explores the analysis of occluding contours in three-dimensional shapes, focusing on the assumptions made by our perception to infer the shape of a surface from its silhouette. The author proves that if the assumptions hold for distant vantage points, the viewed surface must be a generalized cone. This result helps in developing methods to interpret occluding contours and improve image analysis in artificial intelligence.
