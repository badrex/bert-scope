tldr: The authors explore a class of metrics that represent simple spherical radiation in general relativity. They solve Einstein's equations for metrics admitting a family of hypersurface-orthogonal, non-shearing, diverging null curves, which may be considered as representing a simple kind of spherical, outgoing radiation. The study includes examples of solutions to the Maxwell-Einstein equations with a similar geometry and discusses the geometric properties of the curvature tensor and its rate of change along rays.
