tldr: This paper explores the canonical invariants and differential covariants of twisted curves, providing a method to express relations between them without the intervention of other invariants. The author demonstrates how to determine the series of canonical invariants and the connections between the invariants of a curve, ultimately integrating the differential equations of a twisted curve to find its absolute invariant.
