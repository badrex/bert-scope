tldr: This article investigates stress estimates in mantle peridotites by analyzing their dislocation microstructures. The author assesses various geopiezometers, such as dislocation curvature, dislocation density, sub-boundary size, and recrystallized grain size, to estimate the deviatoric stresses acting in the rocks. The study finds that the most reliable geopiezometer is based on olivine neoblast size, yielding stress values in the range of 0.3-0.5 kbar for basalt nodules and the Lanzo massif. These values are compared with stress estimates ascribed to mantle flow by various independent methods, indicating a lower deviatoric stress for asthenosphere flow (10-100 bar). The author concludes that the disagreement between these stress estimates can be explained by the uncertainties in the estimation, leaving room for the possibility that the flow structures in these peridotites represent asthenosphere conditions.
