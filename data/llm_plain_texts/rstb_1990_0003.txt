tldr: The article discusses the purification and characterization of DNA methylases from mouse and pea, which show greater activity with hemimethylated substrate DNA. Both enzymes preferentially methylate cytosines in CpG sequences but not exclusively. The authors describe procedures to overcome the challenge of saturating all possible methylation sites on the DNA. DNA methylation plays a crucial role in gene regulation and maintaining the pattern of replication from one generation to the next.
