tldr: This article by Hermann Helmholtz discusses the normal motions of the human eye in relation to binocular vision. He explains how the eye can move in various directions but cannot rotate around the visual line voluntarily. Helmholtz also describes the use of ocular spectra to determine the position of the eyeball and the law regulating the position of the eye for every direction of its visual line.
