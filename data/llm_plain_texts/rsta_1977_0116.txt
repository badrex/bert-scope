tldr: This article discusses the paragenesis and formation of low-temperature metasomatic garnets, specifically hydrogarnets, in marine sediments. The authors review previous occurrences and findings, and present new evidence from oxygen isotope data that supports the hydrothermal nature of these occurrences. They also consider alternative explanations for the formation of these garnets and revise the stability relations of the hydrogarnet subgroup of the garnet family.
