tldr: This article investigates the nonlinear behavior of finite amplitude electron plasma waves, focusing on electron trapping effects. The authors compare the spatial evolution of a stable, finite amplitude wave with theory and find that trapped particles play a crucial role in the development of instabilities. The study provides insight into the development of strong turbulence in high-temperature plasmas found in astrophysics and fusion devices.
