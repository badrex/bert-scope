tldr: Edm. Halley explains the cause of Venus's unusual daytime visibility in 1714. He uses mathematical principles and geometrical constructions to determine the maximum illumination of Venus's disk when seen from Earth. Halley finds that this occurs when Venus is about 40 degrees away from the Sun and that this phenomenon is not uncommon, happening every eight years. He also uses this opportunity to argue that the disks of fixed stars are incredibly small and that their light is much weaker than that of Venus in this situation.
