tldr: The author's study investigates the effects of combined electric and magnetic fields on the helium spectrum. They observed that each member of the series splits into an asymmetric structure in terms of both displacements and intensities. The study also reveals new effects and variations in the fine structure and energy distribution of the spectral series.
