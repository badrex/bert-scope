revised_title: Electronic Specific Heat and X-ray Absorption of Metals: Exploring Electron Bands
semantic_tags:
  - Electronic specific heat
  - X-ray absorption
  - Electron bands
  - Crystal structure
  - Transition metals
tldr: This article discusses the electronic specific heat and X-ray absorption of metals, focusing on the properties related to electron bands. The authors explore the effects of crystal structure and energy levels on the behavior of electrons in metals, particularly in transition metals. They also analyze the heat capacity of electrons in metals and compare it to the Sommerfeld formula.
