tldr: This article discusses the role and transport of anions in living tissues, focusing on the imbalance between cations and anions in cells. It explores the importance of anion transport in processes such as carbon dioxide transportation in red blood cells and the functioning of chloride channels in excitable tissues. The article also highlights the differences in anion transport mechanisms between plant and animal cells.
