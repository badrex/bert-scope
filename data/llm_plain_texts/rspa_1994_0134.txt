tldr: This article presents a method to generate fundamental solutions or Green's functions for time harmonic point forces and sources in anisotropic piezoelectric, thermoelastic, and poroelastic solids. The author reduces the spatial dimension of the problem from three to one, allowing for the creation of a unidimensional Green's matrix that satisfies the matrix equation. The method is demonstrated for the three field theories considered and provides a foundation for further applications.
