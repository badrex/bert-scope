tldr: The authors studied the motion of electron swarms in hydrogen using far ultra-violet signals. They measured the drift velocity, diffusion coefficient, and radiation quenching of the swarms under various gas pressures and electric fields. The results showed that electron diffusion coefficients were larger than expected from classical theory, and the near and far ultra-violet radiation suffered quenching at higher gas pressures, likely due to molecular dissociation.
