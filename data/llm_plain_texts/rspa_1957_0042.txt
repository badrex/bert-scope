tldr: The article investigates the extensions of order relations in fully ordered subgroups of a group G, specifically when the subgroup H has a finite index in G. The authors show that under certain conditions, the order relation in H can be extended to a full order relation in G. The study is useful in understanding the properties of ordered groups and their extensions.
