tldr: The author, Charles Leigh, describes an artificial digester that he created to study the process of digestion. He observed that an acid liquor could turn meats white, but it did not create chyle. He then created a liquid mixture of spirit of sulfur, spirit of hartshorn, dog chyle, and saliva, which he used to digest various meats. The resulting liquid had the color and taste of chyle, suggesting that a similar liquid may be present in the stomach for digestion. Leigh also discusses other factors that contribute to digestion, such as stomach heat, proper positioning, the omentum, a tunica villosa, and the winding of the intestines.
