tldr: The authors define self-conjugate gravitational fields by splitting the curvature tensor into three 3-tensors of the second rank in a normal co-ordinate system. They identify three different types of self-conjugate gravitational fields and show that in these fields, the gravitational waves propagate with the fundamental velocity, and all the fourteen scalar invariants of the second order vanish. The structure of one type of self-conjugate gravitational field defines a null vector, which can be identified as the vector defining the propagation of gravitational waves.
