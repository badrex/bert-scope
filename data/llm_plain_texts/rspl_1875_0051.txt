tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the force caused by heat communication between a surface and a gas. They also developed a new photometer to measure the difference in temperature caused by light on black and white surfaces. The findings support the existence of reactionary forces or "heat-reactions" when heat is communicated from a surface to a gas, and vice versa.
