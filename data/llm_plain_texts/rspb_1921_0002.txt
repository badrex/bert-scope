tldr: The author investigates the effect of dietary deficiencies on the suprarenal glands of pigeons. They found that feeding pigeons with polished rice led to a great enlargement of the suprarenal glands and an increase in their adrenaline content. This study suggests that the enlargement might be due to the storage of lipoids in the cortex of the gland, and further research is needed to understand the connection between diet, adrenal glands, and polyneuritis.
