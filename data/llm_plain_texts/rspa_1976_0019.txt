tldr: The authors conducted new experiments on the absorption spectrum of Xe I between 18 and 90 Å. They confirmed the presence of a shallow absorption minimum around 60 Å and found that the absorption profile between 40 and 75 Å is in better agreement with the independent particle model than previously reported. A broad absorption maximum between 20 and 50 Å is also detected, which is compared with the predictions of the independent particle model.
