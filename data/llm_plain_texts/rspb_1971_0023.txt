revised_title: 'Investigation of Gas Flow Mechanism in Coniferous Wood'
semantic_tags:
  - Gas flow mechanism
  - Coniferous wood
  - Viscous flow
  - Bordered pits
  - Permeability
tldr: The authors studied the mechanism of gas flow through coniferous wood and found that it follows the viscous/slip regime. They discovered that the specific flow of a gas in this regime is a linear function of its mean pressure. The results provide strong support for the modern theory of pit structure based on electron microscope photographs.
