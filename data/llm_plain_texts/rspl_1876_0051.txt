tldr: The author conducted experiments with a radiometer to study the effects of radiation and gas exhaustion on the force of repulsion. They discovered that the force of repulsion increases as the air is exhausted from the apparatus, reaching a maximum and then decreasing. The author also found that the viscosity of the residual gas is related to the force of repulsion exerted by radiation. These findings contribute to the understanding of the behavior of radiometers and the role of residual gas in their movement.
