tldr: The authors propose a theory to calculate activation energies for creep and stress relaxation in polymers when the limiting moduli vary with temperature. This theory resolves discrepancies in previous measurements by accounting for the temperature dependencies of the relaxed and unrelaxed moduli. The result is applicable to various relaxations in polymeric solids, including the glass-rubber relaxation in amorphous polymers.
