tldr: The author examines the geographical representation and alignment of the Karakoram mountain range in Tibet. They discuss the challenges in determining the alignment due to the plateau's high altitude and the range's original formations. The author also compares different maps and alignments proposed by various explorers and surveys, ultimately objecting to Major Mason's new alignment due to its lack of relation to the drainage and inconsistencies with the established understanding of the range.
