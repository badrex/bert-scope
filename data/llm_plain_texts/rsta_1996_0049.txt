tldr: This article discusses the challenges and discrepancies in high-pressure and high-temperature research using laser-heated diamond-cell experiments. The authors focus on evaluating the criteria used to detect melting and the methods for measuring spatially variable temperatures. They suggest that improvements in melting criteria and imaging spectroradiometry can lead to more reliable results in studying the Earth's deep interior.
