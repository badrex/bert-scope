tldr: The author examines the reproductive organs and fructification of certain Sphaeriaceous fungi, revealing a diverse range of forms and structures within the same individual plant. This polymorphism has significant implications for the systematic arrangement of fungi and the understanding of their reproductive processes. The author presents observations on several species, including Sphceria verruceformis and Sphceria favacea, and discusses the potential identity of some plants based on their shared growth patterns and fructification forms.
