tldr: This article explores the interior modes of black holes using imaginary-frequency waves. The authors analyze the radial wave equation and the spin-weighted spheroidal wave equation to understand the behavior of waves inside black holes. They find that these waves are analogous to external quasi-normal modes and can be used to study the interior of black holes and their properties.
