tldr: This article investigates the head-on collision of a plane shock with a solid corner, focusing on the mathematical methods used to analyze the resulting shock patterns and pressure distribution. The study finds that the reflected shock is made up of straight segments and a curved portion, with the pressure being lower in the region of non-uniform flow between the segments. The findings may have implications for understanding and mitigating the effects of blast waves on buildings and infrastructure.
