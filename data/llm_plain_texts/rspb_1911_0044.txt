tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the inheritance and incidence of cancer in mice. They found that mice with cancerous ancestors had a higher likelihood of developing cancer, suggesting a genetic link. The study also showed that mice with non-cancerous ancestry had a lower incidence of cancer, indicating that selective breeding could potentially create strains of mice with varying susceptibilities to cancer. The results have implications for understanding cancer development and potentially reducing its incidence through shielding individuals from chronic irritation.
