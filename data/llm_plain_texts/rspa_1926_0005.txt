tldr: This article presents a new method for accurately measuring the thermal conductivities of gases. The authors discuss the challenges of disentangling conduction, convection, and radiation effects in previous experiments and introduce a modified hot-wire method to overcome these difficulties. They also compare their results with other methods, such as the plate method, and provide data for atmospheric air.
