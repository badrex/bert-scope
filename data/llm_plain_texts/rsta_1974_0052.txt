tldr: This article investigates the instabilities and convection in a rotating magnetic system, such as the Earth's core, which is essential for understanding the maintenance and generation of the geomagnetic field. The study focuses on a specific M.A.C.-wave model and explores the nonlinear convection that arises when the critical value of convection is exceeded. The relevance of the theory to sunspot formation is also discussed.
