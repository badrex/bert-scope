tldr: The authors study the sound field generated by a sphere that changes its radius and moves along a straight line through an inviscid compressible fluid. They determine the acoustic velocity potential asymptotically when the characteristic speed of the sphere is small compared with the mean sound speed in the fluid. The sound field is expressed using moving source and dipole potentials, providing a more general and simpler representation than previous studies.
