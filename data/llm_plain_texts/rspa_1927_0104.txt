tldr: The author investigates the rusting of steel surfaces in contact and proposes a molecular cohesion theory. They find that when two steel surfaces touch, the forces between the molecules are high enough to detach molecules with a lateral movement. This detachment allows the molecules to combine with oxygen from the atmosphere, causing rusting. The author also notes that glass surfaces have a greater faculty for cohering, possibly due to the ease of obtaining clean surfaces.
