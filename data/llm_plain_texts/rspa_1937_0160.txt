tldr: The authors present a theoretical formula for the solubility of hydrogen in palladium, considering the metal's lattice structure and the energy of absorption. They explain how hydrogen dissolves in palladium and how the amount of hydrogen absorbed depends on temperature and pressure. The formula helps predict the behavior of hydrogen-palladium systems and provides insights into the properties of other metals and their interactions with hydrogen.
