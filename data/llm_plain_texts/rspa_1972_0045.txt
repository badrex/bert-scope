tldr: The authors conducted a detailed rotational analysis of 114 absorption bands of the main systems of 128Te2 and 130Te2 in the wavelength region 385.5 to 523.5 nm. They discovered two upper states, B0+ and a new lower lying state, A0+. The vibrational levels in B0+ are subject to numerous small perturbations, while the levels in A0+ extrapolate smoothly to a limit at about 25920 cm^-1 above v" = 0. The study provides insights into the molecular structure and dissociation energy of Te2.
