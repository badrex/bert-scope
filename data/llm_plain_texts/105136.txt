tldr: In a letter to Mr. William Watson, Philip Miller discusses a mistake made by Professor Gmelin regarding the Sphondylium Vulgare Hirsutum plant. Miller believes that Gmelin has mistaken the species and provides evidence for his claim. He also mentions the differences between the common sort and the large sort of the plant, as well as the common mistakes in botany due to assuming that plants mentioned as common in one country are the same as those in their own country.
