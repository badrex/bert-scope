tldr: This study examines the functional morphology and biology of the Notostraca, a group of crustaceans within the Branchiopoda order. The research covers various aspects of their natural history, habits, and structural features, with a focus on their unique trunk limbs and head anatomy. The findings reveal the versatility of their feeding mechanisms and the importance of their specialized morphology in their benthic lifestyle. The study also discusses the development and ontogeny of their feeding mechanism in two Notostraca species, Triops and Lepidurus arcticus.
