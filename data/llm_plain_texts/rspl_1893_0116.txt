tldr: The author discusses the spread of hyphae in fungal infections and their relationship with inflammation. They observe that the particles are surrounded by leucocytes and can be found in granulation tissue or abscess cavities. The spread of particles and inflammation are interconnected, and a recurrence of both has been noted in cases of amputated limbs affected by fungal infections.
