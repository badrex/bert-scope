tldr: This article explores the concept of relativistic potential vorticity in general relativity. The authors generalize the conservation law of potential vorticity in classical mechanics to relativistic flows, providing a local expression of Kelvin's circulation theorem. They demonstrate how the conservation of circulation follows from the conservation of relativistic potential vorticity.
