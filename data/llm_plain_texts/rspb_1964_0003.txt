tldr: The author investigates the anaerobic fructolysis, lactic acid production, and heat production in bull spermatozoa. They found that on average, more fructose was broken down than lactic acid produced. The amount of heat produced by the spermatozoa was only 9% more than the heat expected based on the enthalpy change associated with the breakdown of fructose to lactic acid. The study discusses the implications of these findings in relation to the metabolic pathways in anaerobic bull spermatozoa.
