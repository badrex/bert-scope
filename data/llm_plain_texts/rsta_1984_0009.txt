tldr: This article discusses the use of natural radiogenic isotope tracers to identify the contributions of mantle, oceanic crust, and continental crust to magma sources. The authors review the geochemical behavior of these tracers and emphasize the importance of assessing mass balance rather than merely recognizing qualitative patterns. They also explore the isotopic compositions of rare gases and pelagic clay in understanding magma sources.
