tldr: The article presents a new method for calculating the times of eclipses of Jupiter's first satellite, which can be used to determine the geographical longitudes of places. The author, James Pound, explains the ease of his calculus and its usefulness in encouraging astronomers to use these eclipses for geographical purposes. The article also discusses the second inequality of the satellite, which is related to the propagation of light.
