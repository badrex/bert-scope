tldr: 'This study examines the sea-ice topography in the Arctic Ocean, focusing on the distribution and characteristics of ice draft, elevation, and pressure ridges. The research identifies two distinct geographical ice regimes: an offshore zone with heavy pressure ridging and a central Arctic Ocean with a more homogeneous ice cover. The findings provide insights into the quantity and thickness distribution of undeformed ice in the Arctic Ocean and help understand the behavior of sea ice under various conditions.'
