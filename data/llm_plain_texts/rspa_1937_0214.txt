tldr: The author examines a simple problem of energy dispersal in a one-dimensional chain of atoms, similar to the deactivation of an adsorbed atom on a surface. Using classical methods, the energy of the center links is found to reduce to less than one-third of its initial value in one complete vibration, with the rate of energy loss ultimately proportional to the inverse square of time.
