tldr: This study investigates the energy and nutrient intake of 204 New Guinean adults from two different regions, Kaul and Lufa. The research found that their daily energy intake varied, with coastal residents consuming more than those in the highlands. The diet primarily consisted of staple vegetables like taro and sweet potatoes, with low protein and fat content. The study also explored the relationship between energy intake, body mass, and age, as well as the daily energy expenditure of various activities. The findings challenge current international standards of energy and protein requirements, suggesting they may not be applicable to all populations.
