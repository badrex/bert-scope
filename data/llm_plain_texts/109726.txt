tldr: This article examines the historical debate surrounding the solar eclipse said to have been predicted by Thales. The author recalculates the elements of several eclipses using new astronomical tables and suggests that the eclipse occurred on September 30, 610 BC. The path of the moon's shadow passed through the northeastern part of Asia Minor, potentially crossing the ground where the armies of Cyaxares and Alyattes met. The author also expresses doubts about the accuracy of the secular variations of the moon's mean longitude, mean anomaly, and mean distance from her node, as deduced from Laplace's formulae.
