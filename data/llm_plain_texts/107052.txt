tldr: The author conducted a series of experiments to decompose muriatic acid using electricity. They found that the electric fluid could separate water and decompose other substances, but it was not effective in fully decomposing muriatic acid. The experiments showed that the hydrogen gas produced during the process came from the water attached to the muriatic acid, and the electric fluid helped combine muriatic acid with oxygen. However, no significant progress was made towards the complete decomposition of muriatic acid through these experiments.
