tldr: 'This article discusses the early history of agriculture, focusing on plant and animal distribution in relation to domestication. The author examines the distributions of wild progenitors and domesticated plants and animals to understand the regions of domestication and ecological limits of adaptation. The article also explores the challenges in determining the origins of domestication, such as changes in climate, human activities, and the evolution of progenitors and domesticates. The author provides examples of sorghum and its various races to illustrate the complexities of plant domestication and the challenges in identifying the center of origin or a center of diversity.'
