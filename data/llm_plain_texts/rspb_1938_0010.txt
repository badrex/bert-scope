  - Xylem Function
tldr: The author explains the mechanism of water transport in plants, focusing on the role of cohesion and tension in the xylem. They describe experiments with a model plant and discuss the factors that contribute to water movement, such as the difference in vapor pressure between the soil and the leaves. The author also addresses common misconceptions and recent evidence supporting the cohesion-tension theory.
