tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the role of solid nuclei in liberating vapour from boiling liquids. They discovered that solid substances can act as efficient nuclei, separating the vapour from the liquid, and preventing soubresauts (bursts of steam). The study focused on liquids with low boiling points, such as carbonic disulphide, which demonstrated the effectiveness of solid nuclei in boiling processes.
