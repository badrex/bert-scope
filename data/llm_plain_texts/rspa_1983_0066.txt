tldr: The authors conducted absorption spectroscopy experiments on laser-excited europium vapour, using a dye laser and a nitrogen laser. They discovered a large number of previously unknown odd parity levels near the first ionization limit and assigned J values to most of these levels. The results showed that the majority of the upper levels could be arranged into five highly perturbed series, arising from the excitation of the 6p electron to high-lying d-orbitals.
