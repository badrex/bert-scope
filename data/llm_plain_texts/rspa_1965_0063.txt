tldr: The authors investigate the photodecomposition of lead iodide and discover that visible light creates excitons, which are mobile and interact with lattice defects to cause chemical decomposition. They propose a mechanism where two excitons react at a preferred site to produce iodine, anion vacancies, and a lead atom. This process has potential applications in image recording and high-resolution photography.
