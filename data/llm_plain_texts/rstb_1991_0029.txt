tldr: The study examines the effects of density-dependent population growth and ecological factors on the life-history evolution of Drosophila populations. The research focuses on the impact of larval and adult densities on the viability, fecundity, and growth rates of Drosophila populations. The findings suggest that increased larval and adult densities lead to higher survival rates and fecundity, which contribute to the overall evolution of life-history traits in these populations.
