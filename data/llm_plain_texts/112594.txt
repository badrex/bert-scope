tldr: This article discusses the research and experiments conducted on gun-cotton, focusing on its manufacture and composition. The author, F.A. Abel, examines the process of converting cotton into gun-cotton and the methods of purification. The article also explores the composition of gun-cotton, its properties, and the factors affecting its explosive characters. The author concludes that the most explosive form of gun-cotton is trinitro-cellulose, and the process perfected by Baron von Lenk produces this substance in a nearly pure condition.
