tldr: The author proposes a quantum theory of color vision, suggesting that the sensation of light is stimulated by the action of photo-electrons in the retina. The strength of the stimulus produced is the origin of color sensations. The evolutionary development of three primary color sensations (red, green, and blue) allows the human eye to interpret the frequencies of light reflected by natural objects.
