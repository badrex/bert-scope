tldr: The study examines the fine structure of the digestive tubules in the marine bivalve Cardium edule using electron microscopy. It identifies three cell types in the tubules: mature digestive cells, mature secretory cells, and immature flagellated cells. The research also investigates the process of ingestion of exogenous materials and the role of acid phosphatase in intracellular digestion. The findings contribute to the understanding of the digestive system and cell types in bivalves.
