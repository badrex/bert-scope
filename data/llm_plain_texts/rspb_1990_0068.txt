tldr: Researchers studied the changes in goldfish retinal ganglion cells during axonal regeneration. They discovered that these cells undergo structural and synaptic reorganizations, such as dendritic and axonal growth, somatic swelling, and dye-coupling. These findings suggest that goldfish retinal ganglion cells may have a similar regenerative competence to mammalian retinal ganglion cells.
