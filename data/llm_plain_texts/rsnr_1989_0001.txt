tldr: This article discusses the discovery of the Raman effect by C. V. Raman and its impact on the field of molecular physics. The Raman effect is a phenomenon where light scattered from a transparent medium experiences a shift in wavelength. This discovery provided a new method for studying molecular vibrations and led to significant recognition for Raman, including the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1930.
