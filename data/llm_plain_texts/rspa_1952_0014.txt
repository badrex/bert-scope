tldr: The authors used Born's model to derive expressions for the frequency and amplitude ratios of alkali and halide ions in an alkali halide crystal for any general normal mode of oscillation. They applied these results to low-frequency acoustic modes, finding that the force acting on an ion due to the polarization field is comparable to the force of interaction with other ions. However, the frequency remains unaffected by the polarization field for low-frequency acoustic modes.
