tldr: This article explores the generation of nodal cubic surfaces by projecting non-singular surfaces in higher dimensions. It classifies these surfaces based on their singularities and provides a unifying principle for understanding their properties. The study of these surfaces has implications for understanding the geometry and topology of higher-dimensional spaces.
