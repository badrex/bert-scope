tldr: This article investigates the diffraction of sea waves around breakwaters and the shelter they provide. The authors use mathematical theories similar to those of light and sound wave diffraction to determine wave patterns and heights on both the leeward and windward sides of the breakwater. They also discuss the conditions in the lee of a small island and the penetration of waves through gaps in breakwaters.
