semantic_tags:
  - Seabird ecology
  - Aldabra Atoll
  - Ecological interactions
  - Zoogeography
  - Seabird conservation
tldr: The article describes the characteristics and dynamics of Aldabra's seabird community, focusing on its ecological interactions and impact on the terrestrial ecosystem. It highlights the absence of certain species due to factors like predation, lack of nesting space, and insufficient feeding grounds. The seabird community plays a significant role in nutrient input to the terrestrial ecosystem, with consequences for the atoll's ecology as a whole. The article also discusses the influence of historical events, such as the introduction of rats and the impact of human activities, on the seabird community and its distribution.
