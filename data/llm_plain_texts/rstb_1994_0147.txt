tldr: The article discusses the extended parasite hypothesis for sexual selection, suggesting that mate choice and maternal selection can favor specific parasite resistances in offspring. It explores the potential for handicapping signals to reveal detailed information about a male's health and resistance genes, as well as the possibility of cheap signals revealing the same information. The article also considers the role of maternal selection for certain allele combinations after mating, potentially enhancing the survival chances of offspring.
