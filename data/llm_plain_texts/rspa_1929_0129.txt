tldr: The authors conducted infra-red investigations on the molecular structure of nitric oxide, a diatomic molecule with a permanent electric moment. They explored the vibration-rotation bands of the molecule and compared the constants obtained from electronic band spectra with those from direct measurements of the infra-red. The study also aimed to detect a gyroscopic motion in the diatomic molecule, which was successfully observed.
