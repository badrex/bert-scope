tldr: The authors examined the structure of the cortex cerebri in various animals, including pigs, sheep, cats, ocelots, and Barbary apes. They found that the five- and six-laminated cortex types have different characteristics in terms of cell size, distribution, and complexity. The results suggest that the dissociation of centers plays an important role in explaining the differences in cerebral activity among these animals. The study provides insights into the anatomical units of the ganglionic layer and their relationship with complex movements.
