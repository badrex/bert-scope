tldr: In a letter to Charles Morton, Mons. De la Lande describes the unique characteristics of a comet observed in Paris in June 1762. The comet had a perihelion distance of 1.0124, and it was unlike any of the previously known 49 comets. The comet was observed until July 5th, but by then, it was too far away and poorly observed.
