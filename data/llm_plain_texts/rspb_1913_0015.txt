tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the effects of adrenalin on veins, finding that it causes contraction in both veins near and far from the heart. They also discovered that adrenalin can induce rhythmic contractions in quiescent rings from the superior vena cava near the heart, suggesting a connection to the myogenic theory of heart rhythmicity. This research provides insight into the role of adrenalin and the sympathetic nervous system in vein and heart function.
