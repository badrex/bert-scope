tldr: The author presents a composite estimate of the phylogeny of all 203 species of primates by combining over a hundred previous estimates using a modified matrix representation with parsimony technique. The resulting well-resolved tree provides a useful framework for comparative biologists and highlights areas of primate phylogeny that still need further research.
