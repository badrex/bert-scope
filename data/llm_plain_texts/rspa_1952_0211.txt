tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the total neutron cross-sections of cobalt, silver, iodine, aluminium, nickel, and gallium using a neutron time-of-flight spectrometer at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment, Harwell. They found that the spectrometer's improved resolution at higher energies allowed for clearer identification of certain levels. The results are presented as curves showing the variation of total cross-section with neutron energy, and the strength of resonances is calculated for some levels.
