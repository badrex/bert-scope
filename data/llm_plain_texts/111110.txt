tldr: The author, Thomas Graham, conducted experiments to study the diffusion of liquids, particularly isomorphous salts. He found that certain salts, like hydrochloric, hydrobromic, and hydriodic acids, have similar diffusion rates. The study also explored the diffusion rates of other substances like hydrocyanic acid, acetic acid, sulphurous acid, alcohol, ammonia, and salts of organic bases. The findings indicate that diverse physical properties can coexist with equal diffusibility in isomorphous substances.
