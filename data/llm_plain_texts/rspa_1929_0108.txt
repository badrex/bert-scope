tldr: This article discusses the transfer of heat in the lower atmosphere through radiation and turbulence. The author focuses on the controlling factors of heat transfer, such as absorption and emission of radiation, transport of heat by turbulence, and the arrival of warmer or colder air. The study aims to understand how these factors contribute to the overall heat transfer in the atmosphere and their impact on weather and climate.
