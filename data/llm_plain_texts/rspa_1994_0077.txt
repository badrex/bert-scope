tldr: This article presents a high-resolution laser-radiofrequency double resonance molecular spectroscopy technique that combines a carbon dioxide laser with radiofrequency spectroscopy to study molecular vibration-rotation states and nuclear hyperfine splitting. The new resolution and precision available are applied to hyperfine transitions in the ground and excited states of molecules, leading to a critical assessment of current theoretical approaches and the introduction of a new term to represent vibration-nuclear magnetic coupling.
