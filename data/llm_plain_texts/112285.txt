tldr: This article by Arthur Cayley explores skew surfaces, also known as scrolls, generated by lines meeting given curves. It presents a further development of the theory of skew surfaces and considers various types of scrolls, such as S(m, n, p), S(m2, n), and S(m3). The author also discusses singularities in the system of curves and introduces a new kind of singularity in a curve in space.
