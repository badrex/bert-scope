tldr: The authors simulated the plastic deformation in a two-dimensional atomic glass using molecular dynamics. They found that the primary mechanism of plastic strain production is local, partly dilatant shear transformations that occur preferentially in the boundaries of liquid-like material separating small quasi-ordered domains. The simulation demonstrated that plastic flow in disordered solids involves localized atomic cluster relaxations, with dislocation glide playing a minor role.
