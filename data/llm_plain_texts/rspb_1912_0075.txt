tldr: The authors successfully cultivated Trypanosoma rhodesiense, a parasite responsible for African sleeping sickness, using two different media. They described the morphology and behavior of the trypanosomes in culture and their virulence. The study also compared the parasite's characteristics with other trypanosomes, such as T. gambiense and T. brucei, and discussed its potential impact on animal health.
