tldr: The author presents a capillary bundle model to explain the displacement of oil from porous media by other fluids. The model demonstrates how various factors, such as viscosity ratio, interfacial tension, and pore size distribution, affect oil recovery. This model can help improve our understanding of oil recovery processes and aid in the development of new techniques for enhanced recovery.
