tldr: The author presents a new approach to integration theory, extending it to upper and lower semi-continuous functions. They demonstrate how the method of monotone sequences enables the proof of classical theorems and their generalizations without relying on the Theory of Sets of Points or the Theory of Integration. This work contributes to the understanding of integration for both bounded and unbounded functions.
