tldr: The authors describe a method to purify adrenal zona glomerulosa cells using gravitational sedimentation. They examine the properties and steroidogenic response of these purified cells to various stimuli, such as potassium, serotonin, cyclic AMP, angiotensin, and ACTH. The study provides insights into the control of aldosterone secretion and the mode of action of these stimuli on the zona glomerulosa cells.
