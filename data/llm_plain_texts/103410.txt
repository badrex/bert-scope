tldr: The Poyson Wood Tree, also known as Swamp Sumach, is a tree found in swamps and wet grounds in New England. It has poisonous qualities that can affect some people by touching or inhaling its scent. The poison causes itching, inflammation, and swelling but is not usually fatal. Some individuals are more susceptible to the poison than others, and the tree's cold texture can help distinguish it from other wood.
