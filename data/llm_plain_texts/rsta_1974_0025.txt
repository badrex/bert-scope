tldr: The author investigates the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation and its connection to a doubly infinite collection of functions. The main theorems characterize the functions that satisfy the complex constraints imposed by the equation, generalizing known results in the theory of continuous-time Markov chains. The study focuses on functions that enjoy property P, which involves examining the properties of individual functions within the -semigroups.
