tldr: This article examines the habitat, pollination, and fertilization processes of the unique Welwitschia mirabilis plant. The author supports the idea that it is partially or entirely insect-pollinated and that its seed maturation occurs more rapidly than in other Gymnosperms. The study also discusses the development of male and female flowers and the prothallial tubes' nature.
