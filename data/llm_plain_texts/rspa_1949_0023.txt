tldr: The authors study the shear strength and instability of crystal structures using bubble rafts as a model. They find that the maximum shear strain in a perfect lattice is less than that deduced from a simple sine law approximation. The presence of dislocations in metals is discussed, explaining their low strengths and the role of dislocations in plastic deformation.
