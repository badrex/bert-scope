tldr: The author conducted a series of experiments to analyze the chemical composition of guaiacum, a resinous substance. They discovered that guaiacum has unique properties compared to other resins, such as its ability to dissolve in nitric acid and its reaction with oxygen. The author also found that guaiacum can be converted into a more perfect resin and that it may be a substance distinct from other resins, gums, and extracts.
