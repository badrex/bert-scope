tldr: The article discusses the value of fossils in phylogenetic analysis and argues that despite the incompleteness of the fossil record, fossils provide unique character data and can be used to calibrate the time axis of phylogenies. The author presents three independent sources of evidence for phylogeny: morphological, molecular, and stratigraphic, and demonstrates that these sources can be cross-tested to improve the quality of phylogenetic analysis.
