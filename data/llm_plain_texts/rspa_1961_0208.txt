tldr: The author presents a soluble model of a break-up process in which particles interact with a fixed center of force and each other through zero-range interactions. The exact solution of this one-dimensional problem is given, and the elastic scattering and break-up amplitudes are explicitly determined. The behavior of the corresponding cross-sections is discussed, and the domain of validity of approximation methods is examined.
