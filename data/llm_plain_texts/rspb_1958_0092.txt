tldr: The study examines the appearance and histological structure of the cuticle in the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria. It compares the cuticle's structure with that of the dark cuticles of other insects, particularly Periplaneta. The research focuses on the exocuticle and endocuticle layers and their role in the hardening and pigmentation of the cuticle. The study also discusses the differences in appearance and structure between the tergites and intersegmental membranes in the locust's cuticle.
