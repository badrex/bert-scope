semantic_tags:
  - Protein chemistry
  - Amino acids
  - Protein denaturation
  - Protein structure
  - Sulphur compounds
tldr: The authors investigated the existence of unidentified sulphur groupings in protein molecules, focusing on the denaturation of proteins. They discovered that some proteins contain sulphur in a form other than cystine, and discussed various experimental findings and methods for identifying these sulphur compounds. This research contributes to understanding the chemistry of proteins and their structure.
