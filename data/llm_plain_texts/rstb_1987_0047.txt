tldr: The study investigates the metamorphosis of male cyprids into a new larval form, the trichogon, in the parasitic barnacle Sacculina carcini. The trichogon is a small, spine-armed larva that migrates through the mantle cavity of the externa and implants cells into the receptacle, playing a crucial role in the life cycle of the parasite. This discovery provides insights into the reproductive and invasive mechanisms of rhizocephalan barnacles.
