tldr: This study investigates the rate of heat-loss at body temperature through convection, radiation, and evaporation under varying atmospheric conditions. The researchers developed a kata-thermometer to measure the rate of cooling and explored its calibration and application in different scenarios. The findings have implications for understanding comfortable and healthy indoor and outdoor conditions, as well as for controlling heating and ventilation systems.
