tldr: 'This article discusses the forces between atoms and ions, focusing on the intrinsic repulsive forces and electrostatic attraction. The authors present a table of force constants that can be used in theoretical calculations of crystal structures and explain the differences between the forces in various types of crystals. They also introduce the concept of "diameters" as a measure of the size of the outer shell of electrons in ions.'
