tldr: The Tyrolean Iceman's clothes contained remains of 30 different bryophytes, including nine mosses that couldn't have grown at the high altitude of the death site. The presence of low-altitude woodland mosses Neckera complanata and crispa suggests that the Iceman came from the south (modern Italy) rather than the north (Austria). This discovery helps to determine the Iceman's origin and provides insight into the palaeoenvironment of the region.
