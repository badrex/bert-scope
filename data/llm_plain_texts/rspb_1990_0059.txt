tldr: The authors investigated stem-cell organization in the mouse small intestine using a somatic mutation-based marker system. They discovered that a single, infrequently dividing stem cell maintains the crypt epithelium through a population of transit stem cells. The entire crypt epithelium is renewed approximately every 12 weeks. This study provides insights into stem-cell organization and renewal in mammalian epithelia, which is essential for understanding tissue maintenance and regeneration.
