tldr: The authors studied monomolecular films of irradiated ergosterol and their relation to vitamin D production. They discovered that the films resemble those of certain ketonic cholesterol derivatives and that the lability of the hydrogen of the OH(OH) group is crucial for the changes induced by ultra-violet irradiation of ergosterol. The chemical changes leading to ketone formation and their impact on vitamin D production are discussed.
