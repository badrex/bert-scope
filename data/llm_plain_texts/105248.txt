tldr: The author, John Ellis, describes a unique red coral found in the East Indies, which is discovered to be formed by marine polyps. The coral's structure is composed of tubes created by these polyps, which raise themselves upright and create the appearance of a "vegetable" form. This finding challenges the belief that corals are plants and provides insight into the growth and development of these fascinating marine organisms.
