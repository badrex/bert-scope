revised_title: 'Wave Propagation and Spiral Patterns in Cellular Slime Mould Aggregation Fields'
semantic_tags:
  - Cellular slime mould
  - Dictyostelium discoideum
  - Wave propagation
  - Aggregation fields
  - Spiral waves
tldr: The article investigates wave propagation and spiral patterns in the cellular slime mould Dictyostelium discoideum using a mathematical model. The model predicts the experimentally observed speed, amplitude, and wavelength of axisymmetric and spiral waves, providing insights into the dynamics of aggregation and chemotaxis in this organism.
