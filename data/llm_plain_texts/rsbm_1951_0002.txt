tldr: Vilhelm Bjerknes was a pioneering meteorologist and hydrodynamicist who made significant contributions to the understanding of atmospheric and oceanic circulation. He was greatly influenced by his father's work and continued to develop his father's ideas on hydrodynamics. Bjerknes discovered the generalization of the circulation theorem of Helmholtz and Kelvin, which led to important applications in meteorology, such as explaining land and sea breezes, mountain and valley winds, and the development of cyclones and anticyclones.
