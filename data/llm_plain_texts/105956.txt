tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the fecundity of various fish species, including herring, smelt, mackerel, and carp. They found that the number of eggs in each species varied greatly, with some fish having millions of eggs. The author's findings challenge previous accounts of fish fecundity and provide a more accurate understanding of fish reproduction.
