tldr: The authors studied the homogeneous thermal decomposition of nitrous oxide and found it to be a bimolecular reaction. They determined the activation energy required for the reaction and explained it using the Arrhenius equation. The results showed that the reaction could be interpreted as a simple thermal activation by collision.
