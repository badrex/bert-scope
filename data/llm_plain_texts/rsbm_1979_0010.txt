tldr: 'Francis Charles Fraser was a renowned cetologist and zoologist who made significant contributions to the study of whales, dolphins, and porpoises. He spent most of his career at the British Museum (Natural History) and was a key member of the Discovery Investigations, which focused on studying the life and death of whales in relation to their physical and biological surroundings in the Southern Ocean. Fraser's research on the development of krill, the food of large baleen whales, was a crucial part of his work, and he also developed methods for marking and tracking whales to study their movements in the ocean.'
