tldr: The author, A.W. Hofmann, investigates the composition of aniline-blue, a colorant derived from coal-tar. He discovers a new compound, diphenylamine, which has a unique reaction with concentrated nitric acid, turning the solution intensely indigo-blue. This discovery opens up the possibility of producing new colorants and provides a general method for producing secondary aromatic monamines.
