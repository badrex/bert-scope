tldr: 'This study investigates the course of metabolism in swine under varying conditions of age, weight, food, and temperature. The researchers measured the heat evolution of a fasting hog at different temperatures and fasting durations using a calorimeter. They observed that the resting metabolism varied throughout the fasting period and found that temperature played a significant role in the hog's metabolism. The results provide insights into the effects of temperature on basal metabolism in swine.'
