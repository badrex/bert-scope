tldr: The author, Balfour Stewart, conducted experiments to determine the change in the elastic force of dry atmospheric air between 32°F and 212°F. He also investigated the temperature of the freezing point of mercury. The results showed a slightly different coefficient of increase of elasticity of air compared to Regnault's findings. Additionally, Stewart discovered that the temperature of the freezing point of mercury remains constant, with a difference in readings between an air-thermometer and a standard mercurial thermometer due to an anomalous contraction of mercury before freezing.
