tldr: The authors used the time-stepping method to study the growth of normal-mode instabilities in steep surface waves. They found two distinct types of instability: subharmonic instabilities with low growth rates and local (superharmonic) instabilities leading to wave breaking. The study confirms the initial rates of growth of these instabilities and reveals the disintegration of the wave train, ultimately leading to breaking waves.
