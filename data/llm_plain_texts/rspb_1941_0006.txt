tldr: 'This study investigates the electrical polarization of frog skin using direct currents. The results show that frog skin is electrically non-homogeneous and in a state of disequilibrium. The findings suggest a three-unit model with a series resistance and local action between an anodic and a cathodic area. This research provides evidence for understanding the electrical behavior of frog skin and its implications in interphases and membrane studies.'
