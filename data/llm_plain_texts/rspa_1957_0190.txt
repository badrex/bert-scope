tldr: This article analyzes the thermal properties of alkali halide crystals, focusing on the heat capacity and its relation to the crystal's frequency spectrum. The authors use experimental data to calculate various properties, such as the Gruneisen parameter and the Debye temperature, and discuss the effects of anharmonicity and thermal expansion on the crystal's behavior. Their findings provide insights into the behavior of insulators at low and high temperatures.
