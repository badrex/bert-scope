tldr: This article presents a palaeomagnetic survey of rock formations in Northwest Argentina, focusing on Cambrian, Cambro-Ordovician, and Ordovician formations. The study reveals that these rocks have been partially remagnetized, and thermal cleaning helps to uncover the lower Palaeozoic geomagnetic field. The findings contribute to understanding the Earth's ancient magnetic field and the geological history of the region.
