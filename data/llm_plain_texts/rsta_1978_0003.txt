tldr: This article discusses the controversy surrounding the appropriate creep law and mechanism for rocks deforming under the stress, temperature, and pressure conditions found within the Earth's mantle. The author argues that small strain, transient creep, rather than steady-state creep, is involved in the isostatic rebound phenomenon, and that power law creep is likely the creep law governing convective flow in the mantle.
