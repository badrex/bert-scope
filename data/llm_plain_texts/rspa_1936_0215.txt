tldr: The author conducted experiments to measure the torque between rotating cylinders and studied the effect of centrifugal force on turbulence. They found that when only the inner cylinder rotates, the flow becomes unstable at a certain Reynolds number. The experiments also determined the critical Reynolds numbers for the transition from stream-line to turbulent flow and the effect of rotation on these critical speeds.
