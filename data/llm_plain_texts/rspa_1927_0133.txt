tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the process of photosynthesis in living plants and in vitro. They discovered that photosynthesis is a heterogeneous reaction that occurs on a surface, and the plant pigments play a crucial role in the process. The study also found that the activation of carbonic acid on the surface can be achieved by visible light, which helps explain the natural process of photosynthesis.
