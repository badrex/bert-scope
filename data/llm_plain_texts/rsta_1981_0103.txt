tldr: The article studies the behavior of Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids, particularly polymer solutions, in complex geometries using flow visualization techniques and numerical simulations. The authors focus on the effects of fluid elasticity on flow characteristics and find that the agreement between theory and observation is very satisfactory.
