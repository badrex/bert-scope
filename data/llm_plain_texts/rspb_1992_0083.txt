tldr: The authors discovered that when cortical astrocytes are activated by basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), they secrete molecules that stimulate the differentiation of mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons. This finding could have implications for understanding and potentially treating Parkinson's disease, as the neurons affected in this condition are the same ones that are influenced by the astrocyte-secreted molecules. The study shows that bFGF is more potent than other neurotrophic factors in this process.
