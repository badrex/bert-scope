tldr: The article discusses the long-term hazards of man-made chemicals, specifically dieldrin, chlorfenvinphos, and carbophenothion, used as wheat seed treatments. These chemicals have caused harm to wintering geese and other wildlife. The withdrawal of dieldrin and the introduction of less persistent alternatives led to a reduction in environmental contamination, but new challenges arose with the side-effects of chlorfenvinphos and carbophenothion. The importance of critical surveillance and pre-clearance testing of new chemicals for potential hazards to the environment is emphasized.
