tldr: 'The article discusses the discovery of the cause of sleeping sickness, a deadly disease in tropical Africa, by Dr. A. Castellani and the controversy surrounding it. Castellani discovered trypanosomes in the cerebro-spinal fluid of patients with sleeping sickness, but it was Lieut.-Colonel Sir David Bruce who brought the etiological significance of this finding to Castellani's attention. The article recounts the story of the Sleeping Sickness Commission, the investigations, and the discovery of the cause of the disease, which led to the development of strategies to combat it.'
