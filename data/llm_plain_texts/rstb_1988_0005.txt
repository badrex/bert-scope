tldr: This article discusses the integration of beneficial organisms and chemical crop protection to improve agricultural practices. It explores the selectivity of insecticides, the potential for genetically modifying beneficial organisms to resist pesticides, and the use of semiochemicals to improve the efficiency of entomophagous pathogens. Additionally, the article highlights the prospects of genetically manipulating crop plants to enhance predation and parasitism of pests.
