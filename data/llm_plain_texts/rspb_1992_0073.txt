tldr: Researchers successfully produced deacetoxycephalosporin C (DAOC) in Penicillium chrysogenum transformants by introducing hybrid genes. This discovery could lead to the development of new cephalosporin antibiotics without the need for industrial solvents. The study demonstrates the potential of genetic engineering to expand the range of useful metabolites from microorganisms.
