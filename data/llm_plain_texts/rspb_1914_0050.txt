tldr: The authors conducted a study in the Upper Shire Valley to investigate the presence of trypanosomes in wild Glossina morsitans and wild game. They discovered that the same four species of trypanosomes found in the Proclaimed Sleeping Sickness Area were present in the area, and that these trypanosomes caused disease in dogs and goats. The study also found that the tsetse flies in the Upper Shire district carried the same trypanosome species, which likely means that cases of sleeping sickness will be found among the local natives.
