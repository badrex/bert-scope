tldr: The author investigates variations in the spectra of carbon electrodes and the influence of one substance on the spectrum of another. They examine the effects of different gases, salts, and solutions on the carbon spectrum and discuss the possibility that some lines attributed to cyanogen may actually be due to elementary carbon. The author also observes that the presence of certain elements can modify and strengthen the lines in the carbon spectrum.
