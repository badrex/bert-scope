tldr: The author conducted spectroscopic observations of the Orion Nebula and Jupiter using the Great Melbourne Telescope. They discovered that the nebulosity within and around the trapezium in the Orion Nebula was comparable in brightness to the surrounding nebula. In Jupiter's spectrum, the author found a dark nebulous band between C and D, which they believed could be due to Jupiter's atmosphere. These observations provided insights into the nature of these celestial objects and the potential role of their atmospheres in the formation of their spectral lines.
