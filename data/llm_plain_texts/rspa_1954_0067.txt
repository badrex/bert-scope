tldr: This article explores the reflexion of sound waves of finite amplitude by a rigid wall in a polytropic gas. The author solves a special case where the adiabatic exponent is S and the initial density is proportional to the distance from the wall. The solution shows that a shock wave is generated at the wall, and the motion of the gas behind the shock is determined by the equations of characteristics.
