tldr: The authors investigate the stability and mode of fracture of highly stressed ideal crystals, specifically argon and sodium chloride. They apply the Born stability criteria to these crystals and find that they become unstable before reaching the maximum ideal stress-strain curve. This leads to a reduction in previous estimates of the ideal tensile strength. The study provides insights into the mechanical properties of perfect crystals and their behavior under stress.
