tldr: The author conducted experiments on newly-born animals and birds to study the influence of inspiration on the heart. They found that during energetic efforts of inspiration, the heart's movements decrease or stop momentarily due to a nervous influence passing along the vagus nerve from the medulla oblongata. This discovery suggests that humans can also influence their heart rate through respiration, similar to controlling the size of their pupils.
