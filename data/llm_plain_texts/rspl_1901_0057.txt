tldr: The authors extended Masson's method to measure ionic velocities in aqueous solutions without using gelatin or colored indicators. They found that complex ions play a role in concentrated solutions, affecting transport numbers and ionic velocities. The study shows a remarkable agreement with Masson's figures for some salts and an approximate agreement with Hittorf's figures.
