tldr: The author, Henry Foster, discovered an error in his previous observations of Arcturus' apparent altitude due to an incorrect value of the divisions on the repeating circle's level. He explains the source of the error and provides corrections for the affected observations. Foster also suggests recalculating the intensities of the observations for better results but acknowledges that it is too late for such a computation.
