tldr: Count de Bournon describes the discovery of a new mineral found in Cornwall, consisting of different combinations of arsenic acid with copper and iron. He classifies the arseniates into two main categories: arseniates of copper and arseniates of iron, with several subcategories based on their crystal forms and colors. The author provides detailed descriptions of the minerals' appearances, hardness, specific gravity, and colors, as well as their variations and changes in different conditions.
