tldr: The article discusses a knowledge-based approach to predict protein structure and function using sequence analysis and comparison methods. The authors describe techniques like inverted protein structure prediction, sequence alignment, and structure comparison to identify common folds and predict protein structures from new sequences. They emphasize the importance of developing versatile methods for structure comparison to improve the predictive capability of comparative modeling.
