tldr: The authors describe a new method for synthesizing block copolymers using a flow system. They initiate polymerization in a capillary tube, allowing radicals to grow as they flow down the tube. Upon exiting, these radicals mix with another monomer, completing the synthesis. This method allows for the creation of linear block copolymers with unique properties and potential applications.
