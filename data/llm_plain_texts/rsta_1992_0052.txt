tldr: This article investigates the vibrational behavior of an elastic strip with varying curvature, focusing on the transverse vibration modes. The authors demonstrate that certain normal modes can be confined to the vicinity of the inflection point of the S-shape due to total internal reflection from points with critical curvature. This confinement can produce modes with extraordinarily low damping factors. The authors also study wave propagation and reflection in these strips and compare their theoretical predictions with experimental results, showing good agreement.
