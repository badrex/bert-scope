tldr: The author, W.H. Wollaston, investigates the unique ability of diamonds to cut glass and the factors that contribute to their effectiveness. He discovers that the natural curvature of the diamond's edge, along with its hardness, allows it to create a clean fissure in the glass. Wollaston also experiments with other hard stones, such as sapphires and rubies, and finds that they can cut glass temporarily, but not as effectively as diamonds.
