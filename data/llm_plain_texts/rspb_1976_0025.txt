tldr: This study compares the acetylcholine (ACh) content and release in myasthenic and non-myasthenic human muscle. Researchers found that myasthenic muscle contained about twice as much ACh as control muscle, and the resting release of ACh was approximately the same in both types of muscle. The results suggest that the weakness of transmission in myasthenic muscle is not due to reduced ACh content or release, but rather related to the reduction in the number of acetylcholine receptors at myasthenic endplates.
