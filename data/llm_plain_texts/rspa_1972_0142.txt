tldr: The article investigates the interactions of adsorbate molecules on copper-exchanged X-type zeolite catalysts using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The study examines how the distribution and environment of copper ions change upon adsorption of various molecules, such as carbon monoxide, cyclopropane, and 3,3-dimethylbutene. The results provide insights into the catalytic behavior of the material and the role of transition metal complexes in catalytic reactions over these solids.
