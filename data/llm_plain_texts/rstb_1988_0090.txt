tldr: This study investigates the organization of mechanosensory neuropiles in locust thoracic ganglia, where projections from tactile hairs, hair plates, campaniform sensilla, multipolar sensory cells, and chordotonal organs terminate. The ventral association centres receive terminals from these sensory receptors, while the newly defined lateral association centres contain fibers of motor neurons. The research provides insights into the central projections of sensory receptors within the locust's thoracic ganglia, contributing to the understanding of the locust's sensory system.
