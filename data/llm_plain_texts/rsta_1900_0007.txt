tldr: 'The authors developed a quartz thread gravity balance to measure small variations in the intensity of gravity. They used fused quartz for its unique elastic properties, which allowed them to create a balance with permanent elastic properties. The balance was tested and found to be accurate within one part in 100,000, making it a useful tool for gravity surveys.'
