tldr: The author's research investigates the effects of nitrites on blood and its color-changing properties. They discovered that nitrites modify the color and spectrum of blood by forming compounds with oxidized hemoglobin. Blood treated with nitrites has a reduced ability to absorb oxygen, but still retains the property of ozonizing atmospheric oxygen. The study also introduces the concept of molecular compounds, which are on the boundary between chemical and physical combinations.
