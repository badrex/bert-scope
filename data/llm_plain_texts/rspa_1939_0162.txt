tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the molecular fields of carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide, focusing on thermal separation and viscosity. They discovered a change in the molecular field of these gases, which affected their behavior and properties. This change is important for understanding the physical nature of these gases and their interactions with other substances.
