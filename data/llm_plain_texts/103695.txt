tldr: This article discusses the nature and causes of aneurysms, which are soft, circumscribed tumors that pulse with the heartbeat. The author, F. Nicholls, examines the debate over whether aneurysms are caused by artery dilation or a rupture of the internal and external artery coats. Nicholls also presents a case study of an aneurysm and suggests that it is formed by blood forcing through the ligamentous coat and distending the membranous outer coat.
