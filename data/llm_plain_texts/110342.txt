tldr: The author, A.P.W. Philip, discusses the relationship between the nervous and muscular systems in animals. He proposes that the brain and spinal marrow are the only active parts of the nervous system, while nerves, plexuses, and ganglions are passive and only serve to convey and combine information from the active organs. This is contrary to the views of many physiologists who consider ganglions as the sources of nervous influence. Philip conducts an experiment on a pithed animal to test this theory, applying mechanical irritation and chemical agents to the ganglions and plexuses of the ganglionic nerves. He concludes that the brain and spinal marrow supply an inanimate agent, similar to galvanic influence, which affects the muscular fiber as a stimulant or sedative.
