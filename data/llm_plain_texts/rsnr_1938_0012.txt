tldr: The International Geographical Congress held in Amsterdam in July 1938 was the largest post-war congress, with over 1000 geographers attending. The congress covered various sections including cartography, oceanography, and colonial geography, discussing topics such as the use of air photographs for surveying, the relief of the ocean floor, and the possibilities of white colonization in the tropics. The Dutch organization was highly efficient, providing pre-congress volumes of all communications for attendees to study.
