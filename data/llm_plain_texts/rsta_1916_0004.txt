tldr: The author explores linear differential equations with periodic coefficients and their applications in astronomy. They discuss the stability of oscillations represented by the Mathieu-Hill equation and present a general method for solving systems of linear differential equations. The author also applies the method to specific cases, such as the small oscillations of three gravitating particles in an equilateral triangle.
