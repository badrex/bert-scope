tldr: The author, George Atwood, conducted experiments and analyzed geometrical propositions to determine the positions of homogeneous bodies floating freely on a fluid. The study focused on understanding the factors affecting the stability and equilibrium of floating bodies, such as specific gravity, volume, and shape. Atwood's findings provided valuable insights into the behavior of floating bodies and the stability of ships.
