tldr: The authors conducted experiments with inorganic colloidal solutions to study the slow metastable depositions that form structures resembling living organisms. They found that these forms closely mimic the morphology of lower aquatic animals, but have not observed any evidence of organic carbon compounds or life in these structures. The study of these inorganic growths contributes to understanding the origin of life and the evolution of organic forms.
