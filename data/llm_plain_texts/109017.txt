tldr: The author describes a previously unknown genus of tubularine hydrozoan fossils found in the Carboniferous limestone series of Ayrshire and Lanarkshire. The fossils, named Palaeocoryne, have a unique structure with a dactylose base, a cylindrical stem, and a symmetrical conical body with tentacular processes. The author classifies Palaeocoryne as a member of the Hydrozoa order, specifically within the Tubularidae family and near the Eudendridae. The fossils provide valuable information about the ancient ecosystem and the evolution of these organisms.
