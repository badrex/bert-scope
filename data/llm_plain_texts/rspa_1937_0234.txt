semantic_tags:
  - Neon lamps
  - Reciprocal inhibition
  - Circuit theory
  - Distraction
  - Oscillation
tldr: 'The author investigates the behavior of osglim lamps, which are neon lamps wired in parallel, and their ability to demonstrate reciprocal inhibition. The study aims to understand the underlying mechanisms and time relations of this phenomenon, which is similar to mental distraction. The author presents various experiments and discusses different hypotheses to explain the behavior of osglim lamps and their potential applications in understanding reciprocal inhibition.'
