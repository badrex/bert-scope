tldr: This article reviews studies on aquatic primary production in the Antarctic, focusing on phytoplankton, ice-flora, and benthos in both marine and freshwater habitats. It discusses the physiology of cold-water plants, their adaptation to low temperatures, and their ability to survive long periods of darkness. The article also summarizes primary productivity measurements in Antarctic seas and the factors affecting them, such as light intensity, temperature, and turbulence.
