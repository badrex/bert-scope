tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the composition and physiological effects of black-damp, a dangerous gas found in coal mines. They discovered that black-damp is primarily composed of nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide, and causes respiratory distress when inhaled. The findings contribute to understanding the hazards of working in coal mines and improving safety measures.
