tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effects of light and darkness on the development and growth of silkworms. They found that silkworms developed at a similar rate in both light and dark conditions, with no significant differences in size, color, or metamorphosis. This suggests that light may not play a crucial role in the development and growth of silkworms.
