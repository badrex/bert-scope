tldr: The author, Christopher Middleton, introduces a new azimuth compass that allows for easier and more accurate determination of the compass variation or magnetic needle at sea. The compass eliminates the need for multiple people to manage it and reduces errors. Middleton also provides an alternative method for finding the compass variation without complex calculations, making the instrument more accessible to seamen.
