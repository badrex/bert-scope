tldr: The authors study the Hausdorff dimension of sets of points that have infinitely many distinct integer solutions satisfying a given inequality. These sets are relevant in the perturbation theories of lower-dimensional tori in nearly integrable Hamiltonian systems. They find that the Hausdorff dimension is independent of certain parameters and depends only on others, extending the results to the case of infinite co-dimension, which is relevant in the KAM-theory of certain nonlinear partial differential equations.
