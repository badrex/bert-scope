tldr: The author explains the process of volatilization of salt of tartar and other fixed salts, discussing the role of alcali and acid salts in the fixation and volatilization of substances. He also describes the importance of the interaction between these salts and earthy particles in the formation of fixed salts and their resistance to dissolution. The author provides a method for separating and volatilizing fixed salts using fermentation and crude tartar as a ferment.
