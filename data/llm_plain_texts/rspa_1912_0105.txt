revised_title: Direct Production of Characteristic X-Rays by Cathode Particles
semantic_tags:
  - X-rays
  - Cathode rays
  - Characteristic radiation
  - Independent radiation
  - Barkla effect
tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the production of characteristic X-rays by cathode particles. They discovered that the bulk of the effect is due to a direct transformation of the energy of the cathode rays into characteristic X-rays, while the indirect action suggested by Barkla and Sadler is a small remainder. The direct and indirect effects happen simultaneously when the speed of the cathode rays exceeds a definite value.
