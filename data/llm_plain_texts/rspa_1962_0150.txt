tldr: The authors measured the coefficient of sound absorption in dilute solutions of helium-3 in liquid helium II, finding that the absorption is less than in pure helium and the peak in the absorption-temperature curve is shifted to lower temperatures. The addition of helium-3 speeds up the interactions between thermal excitations in the liquid, reducing the second viscosity responsible for most of the absorption in pure helium II at higher temperatures. The results support Dransfeld's treatment of the absorption mechanism in this temperature range.
