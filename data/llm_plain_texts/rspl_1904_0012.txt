tldr: This article investigates the toxic effects of coal gas on frog muscles and discovers that benzene, a component of coal gas, is responsible for the poisonous properties. The author demonstrates that removing benzene from coal gas through oil absorption eliminates its toxic effects on frog muscles. This finding explains the differences observed between the actions of coal gas and carbon monoxide on living organisms.
