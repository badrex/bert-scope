tldr: This article by Michael Faraday explores the principles of induction, conduction, and discharge of electricity. He investigates the transition between insulation and conduction, the role of gases in insulation, and the effects of heat on conducting power. Faraday also examines electrolysis, the specific conducting capacities of dielectrics, and the appearance of electric sparks in different gases.
