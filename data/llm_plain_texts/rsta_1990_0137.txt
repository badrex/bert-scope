tldr: The authors investigate the chemical basis for the unique properties of the glucose oxidase/TTF-TCNQ enzyme electrode. They explain the behavior of many organic salt systems and provide a framework for designing electrode materials for specific applications. The study focuses on the TTF-TCNQ electrode's chemical and structural properties, which contribute to its heterogeneous nature and complex electron transfer reactions.
