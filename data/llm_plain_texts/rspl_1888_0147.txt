tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the magnetization curves of iron at varying temperatures. The method used was similar to a previous experiment on nickel. The temperatures were estimated by measuring the resistance of a copper secondary coil, and the results showed the resistances and estimated temperatures for each curve.
