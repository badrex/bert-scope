tldr: The author, Carlo Matteucci, conducted experiments to study the muscular current and its direction using frogs. He discovered that the muscular current's existence and intensity depend on the changes in structure and composition that occur during muscle nutrition. The author also demonstrated the decomposition of iodide of potassium and the effects of different gases on the muscular current.
