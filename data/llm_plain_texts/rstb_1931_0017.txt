tldr: The authors conducted a quantitative examination of the types of products formed from glucose by various species of fungi using the carbon balance sheet method. They analyzed the growth and metabolism of different fungi, focusing on their ability to convert glucose into carbon dioxide and other metabolic products. The study provides insights into the classification and physiology of fungi, particularly in the Ascomycetes class.
