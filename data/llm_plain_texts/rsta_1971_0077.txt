revised_title: Dynamic Thermal Stresses in Pulsed Reactors: Experimental and Theoretical Analysis
semantic_tags:
  - Thermal stresses

  - Elastic displacements
  - Enriched uranium
  - Neutron bombardment
tldr: This article discusses the dynamic thermal stresses in a pulsed reactor, focusing on the experimental and theoretical analysis of elastic displacements in slender cylinders and cones when rapidly heated. The authors describe experiments on enriched uranium cylinders and cones subjected to large neutron pulses in the U.K.A.E.A. pulsed reactor Viper, and find good agreement between theoretical and experimental displacements.
