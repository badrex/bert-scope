revised_title: Exploiting Physical Optics Principles in Crystal-Structure Determination
semantic_tags:
  - Crystallography
  - X-ray diffraction
  - Fourier transform
  - Optical transform
  - Crystal structure determination
tldr: The authors describe new methods for determining crystal structures using the principles of physical optics and the analogy between the diffraction of light by holes and the diffraction of X-rays by atoms. They introduce an instrument that produces diffraction patterns rapidly and discuss the use of optical transforms and weighted reciprocal lattices to solve complex crystal structures. These methods can increase the speed and efficiency of crystal structure determination.
