tldr: The study investigates the structure of sarcolemma in denervated skeletal muscles of rats. It shows that the activity of cholinesterase associated with the sarcolemma decreases significantly in denervated muscles. The extra-junctional sarcolemma of the denervated muscle has 15-18 nm particles, which are likely to be newly synthesized acetylcholine receptors. These particles are often clustered and are preferentially attached to the P face of the sarcolemma.
