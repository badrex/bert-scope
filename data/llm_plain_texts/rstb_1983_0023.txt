tldr: This article investigates the origin and magnitude of the transmembrane resting potential in living cells. It explores various models and factors, such as active transport, ion transport, and the Donnan system, to explain how these contribute to the resting potential. The study aims to provide a theoretical framework that can account for observed resting potentials in different cell types and potentially offer practical applications.
