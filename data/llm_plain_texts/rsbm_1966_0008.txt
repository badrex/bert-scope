tldr: Herbert John Gough was a pioneer in the research of the fatigue of metals, contributing significantly to the understanding of the behavior of metals under stress conditions. His work provided a foundation for engineers to design more reliable and durable machinery. Gough's research covered a wide range of subjects, including fatigue under combined stresses, corrosion fatigue, and fretting corrosion, using various techniques such as mechanical testing, metallurgical microscopy, and X-ray diffraction.
