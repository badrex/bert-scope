tldr: The authors explore the role of space-time topology in quantizing matter fields on a fixed pseudo-Riemannian space-time. They consider twisted vector bundles and discuss the implications of twisted quantum fields on the commutator function, Feynman function, and regularized stress tensor. The study also suggests that the process of spontaneous symmetry breaking may be altered in the twisted case.
