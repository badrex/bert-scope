tldr: The author examines the physical characteristics of spark spectra of elements, focusing on the extension, nimbus, and continuous spectrum. They observe that the extension of lines is related to the volatility and atomic mass of the elements, while the nimbus is influenced by the chemical activity and density of the vapour. The continuous spectrum is linked to the formation of volatile oxides. These findings provide insights into the properties of atoms and their spectra.
