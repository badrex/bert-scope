tldr: The article investigates the calcium current in squid giant axon and its relationship with excitable membranes. The researchers found that the sodium channel of the squid axon membrane is partially permeable to calcium ions, and that tetrodotoxin-sensitive inward and outward currents are carried by external calcium ions and internal cesium ions, respectively. This study provides insights into the functioning of ion channels and the role of calcium ions in nerve fibers.
