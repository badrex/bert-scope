tldr: The study investigates the effects of hypophysectomy on the reproductive organs of male and female ferrets during anoestrus. The results show that hypophysectomy inhibits the onset of breeding season changes and only slightly accentuates the atrophic condition of the reproductive organs. This suggests that the pituitary body of the ferret is practically inactive during the extreme of anoestrus.
