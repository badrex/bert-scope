tldr: The authors investigated the submicroscopic structure of dental enamel using X-ray diffraction and photomicrographic methods. They found a relationship between the direction of enamel prisms and the arrangement of crystallites, with regular prisms associated with a more ordered crystallite structure. This research provides a better understanding of enamel structure and its implications for dental health.
