tldr: This article investigates the behavior of platinum and gold electrodes in sulfuric acid and alkaline solutions containing oxygen. The authors study the cathodic depolarization process and the anodic polarization, providing insights into the potential differences and the formation of adsorbed oxygen layers on the electrode surfaces. The findings contribute to the understanding of electrode processes and the role of oxygen in these reactions.
