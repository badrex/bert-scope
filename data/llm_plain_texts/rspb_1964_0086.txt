tldr: Researchers Franca Buffoni and H. Blaschko successfully purified and crystallized an enzyme from pig plasma called benzylamine oxidase, which is also known as histaminase. They discovered that the enzyme oxidizes benzylamine, histamine, mescaline, and 4-picolylamine. The purified enzyme had a molecular weight of 195,000 and contained about four atoms of copper per molecule. This research helps to understand the metabolism of benzylamine and the relationship between benzylamine oxidase and histaminase.
