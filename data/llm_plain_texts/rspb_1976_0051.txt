tldr: The authors investigated the elastic properties and ultrastructure of the lens capsule basement membrane in cats. They compared the membrane's elastic properties to a lightly vulcanized rubber membrane and found that at low stress values, the Young modulus of elasticity was similar, but at moderate extension, the basement membrane had a higher modulus. The ultrastructure of the basement membrane was examined using electron microscopy, revealing fragments of parallel filaments with little tendency to cross over or link with each other. These findings suggest that the extension of coiled superhelices of the filaments, rather than the extension of non-extensile randomly linked filaments, would be an appropriate model for the basement membrane.
