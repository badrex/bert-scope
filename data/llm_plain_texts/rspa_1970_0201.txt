tldr: The authors conducted an experiment to investigate the precessional couple on a gyro-compass as a function of depth below the Earth's surface. They aimed to test the hypothetical existence of a 'tied' aether, which could explain the negative result of the Michelson-Morley experiment. The experiment compared the precessional couple at the Earth's surface with that at a depth of 920 meters. The result was negative, as no change with depth was detected to the accuracy of 1 part in 10^4. This study helps to understand the properties of space and the possible constituents within it.
