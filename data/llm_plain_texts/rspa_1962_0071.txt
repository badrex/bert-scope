tldr: This study measures the thermal conductivity of tantalum and niobium at low temperatures, finding that it increases as the temperature decreases. The results are analyzed and compared to the BCS theory of superconductivity, showing good agreement for tantalum. The authors also estimate the size of the energy gap in tantalum and niobium based on their findings.
