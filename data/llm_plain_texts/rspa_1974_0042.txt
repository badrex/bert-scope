tldr: The article describes the development of a pressure modulator radiometer for the Nimbus F satellite, which can remotely measure atmospheric temperature from 40 to 90 km altitude. The radiometer uses pressure modulation and two scanning techniques, pressure scanning and Doppler scanning, to select and measure radiation emitted by the atmosphere. This instrument enables improved global coverage and daily measurements of atmospheric temperature, providing valuable data for understanding the Earth's atmosphere and climate.
