tldr: The authors conducted a study to determine the natural food source of the tsetse fly, Glossina palpalis, which is responsible for transmitting Sleeping Sickness. They found that the flies primarily feed on birds, and discovered that the disease can be transmitted through the consumption of infected goat's milk. This information is crucial for understanding the transmission and prevention of Sleeping Sickness.
