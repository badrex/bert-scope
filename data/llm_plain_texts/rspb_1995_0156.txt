tldr: 'The study found that the maximum energy intake rate in passerine birds is proportional to their basal metabolic rate. This discovery helps understand how birds, especially migrants, can efficiently build up fuel reserves for migration. The research also suggests that energy intake rates may not limit breeding performance in passerine birds.'
