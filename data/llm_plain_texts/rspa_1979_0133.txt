tldr: The authors develop a model that allows for both homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation of gas bubbles in materials, focusing on the simultaneous processes and their effects on bubble density and trap binding energy. The model provides insights into the temperature dependence of bubble formation and the importance of understanding gas bubble nucleation for materials used in fast breeder reactor performance.
