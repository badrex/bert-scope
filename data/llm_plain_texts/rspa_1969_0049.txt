tldr: This study investigates the electrical conduction in ultra-thin metal films through experimental analysis. The research verifies the conclusions from a previous theoretical analysis, which proposed a model for quantum mechanical electron tunnelling and thermionic emission in metal films. The potential barrier heights for electron tunnelling between gold, platinum, and silver particles through soda and barium glass substrates are determined, and the effects of the substrate and film materials on conduction are examined.
