tldr: "The author demonstrates how to quantize and interpret relativistic wave equations using an indefinite metric, allowing for the handling of equations involving spin greater than one. The physical interpretation is related to the transformation, and the relationship between spin and statistics is discussed, concluding that there is no necessary connection between the two, except for special cases."
