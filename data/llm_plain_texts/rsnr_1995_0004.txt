tldr: This article examines a poetic tirade against Joseph Priestley, a prominent 18th-century scientist and religious figure, and how it reflects the distrust of science during that time. The poem, written by John Morfitt, expresses conservative views and anti-scientific sentiments, showing how science was seen as a threat to the established order and religious beliefs. The author argues that this distrust of science played a role in the riots against Priestley and sheds light on the attitudes that shaped the event.
