semantic_tags:
  - Particle Accelerators
  - High-Energy Physics
  - Collider Experiments
  - Detector Technology
  - Particle Physics
tldr: This article discusses the current and future options for particle accelerators and experiments, focusing on the highest energy machines in operation and under construction. It explores the potential of existing techniques for accelerators and detectors and the need for new techniques beyond the next upward step in energy. The article also reviews the performance of proton-antiproton colliders, such as the CERN proton-antiproton collider and the Fermilab Tevatron, and discusses the development of new machines like the Stanford Linear Collider, the Large Electron-Positron Collider at CERN, and the Hadron-Electron Ring Accelerator. Lastly, it considers future circular collider options, including the Large Hadron Collider and the Superconducting Super Collider.
