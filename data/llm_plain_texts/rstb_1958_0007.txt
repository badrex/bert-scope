tldr: The study examines the life history and distribution of the lancelet species Branchiostoma nigeriense in Lagos Lagoon. It reveals that the lancelets enter brackish water when the salinity is not lower than 13 parts per thousand in the autumn, metamorphose at the end of December, and give rise to adults that colonize the sand deposits of the lagoons. The adults reach maturity and spawn in the spring, but die when the salinity of the water falls below the threshold value for survival. The marine populations have an annual cycle, spawning from August to October or November each year.
