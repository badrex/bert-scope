tldr: The author examines the structure, evolution, and origin of amphibia, focusing on fossil specimens and their relationships to living species. They discuss the importance of studying the evolutionary trends of different orders of amphibia to determine their connections and construct hypothetical ancestors. This research allows for a better understanding of the primitive amphibian structure and its relation to fish of similar ages.
