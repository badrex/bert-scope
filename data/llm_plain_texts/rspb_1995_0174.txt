tldr: The authors conducted an experimental study using the red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum) to investigate the short-term competitive advantages of evolution in sexual populations. They found that sexual populations can evolve and adapt rapidly enough to overcome the two-fold reproductive disadvantage of male production, challenging the hypothesis that sexual individuals cannot evolve quickly enough to compensate for the cost of males before being eliminated by asexual competitors.
