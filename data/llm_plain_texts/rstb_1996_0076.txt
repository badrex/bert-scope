tldr: 'This study investigates the molecular and morphological evolution within small islands, focusing on lizards as model organisms. The research reveals that natural selection for current ecological conditions is a primary force influencing morphological population differentiation, regardless of phylogenetic history. By studying numerous populations within small, heterogeneous islands, a better understanding of the factors causing geographic variation can be achieved.'
