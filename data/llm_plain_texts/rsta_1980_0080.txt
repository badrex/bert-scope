tldr: This article discusses the role of residuals in engineering steels and their impact on material properties. It highlights the need for steel users to consider the actual forming operation before specifying low residuals and suggests strategies to cope with the rise in residual content, such as restricting the use of low residual steels to essential applications, determining the enrichment factor for specific materials, and taking advantage of higher hardenability.
