tldr: The authors measured the thermal expansion of various phthalocyanines and porphins over a range of temperatures from 90 to 60 K. They used a new furnace design and a moving film oscillation camera to determine small changes in lattice spacing with high relative accuracy. The results showed differences in behavior between hydrogen and platinum phthalocyanines, which may be due to the increased space required by the platinum atoms as the temperature rises compared to the hydrogen in hydrogen phthalocyanine.
