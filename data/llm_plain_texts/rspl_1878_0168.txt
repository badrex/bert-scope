tldr: The author discusses the relationship between the magnetism of the Earth and sunspots, suggesting that the sun's magnetic influence and the Earth's magnetic susceptibility may increase during times of maximum sunspots. They also present new research on spectrum analysis, specifically a new normal map of the solar spectrum.
