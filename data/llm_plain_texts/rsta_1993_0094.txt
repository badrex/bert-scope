revised_title: Self-Assembly and Organization in Liquid Crystals: Isotropic Phases of Amphiphilic Aggregates
semantic_tags:
  - Liquid crystals
  - Self-assembly
  - Amphiphilic molecules

  - Statistical mechanics
tldr: This article reviews recent work on the various isotropic phases of amphiphilic molecules in solution, focusing on simple models that encapsulate the interactions between amphiphiles, solvents, and their mutual interactions. It discusses spherical and anisometric micelles, their interactions, and the effects of fields and flow on rod-like micelles. The article also explores the aggregation of amphiphiles into bilayers and the possible stability of other isotropic bilayer phases.
