tldr: The authors present a stereocontrolled, enantiomerically specific total synthesis of thienamycin, an antibiotic of exceptional potency and breadth of antibacterial spectrum. They use L-aspartic acid as a suitable precursor and achieve stereocontrol by potassium tri-j^c-butylborohydride reduction of a thermodynamically formed 3a-acetylazetidinone intermediate. The key [3.2.0] bicyclic ring system is prepared by a metal-catalyzed carbene insertion reaction.
