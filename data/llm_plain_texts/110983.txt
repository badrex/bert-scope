tldr: The author, William A. Norton, presents a theory that terrestrial magnetism can be derived from the thermal elements of the Earth. He establishes propositions that all magnetic elements of a place can be deduced from its thermal elements, and that the distribution of the Earth's magnetism can be theoretically derived from its heat distribution. This suggests that the laws of terrestrial distribution of magnetism and heat are closely related, and that these principles have intimate physical relations. The author also believes that the mathematical theory of terrestrial magnetism is accurate and can be used to derive magnetic elements with simple formulas.
