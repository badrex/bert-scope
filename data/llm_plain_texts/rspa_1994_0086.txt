tldr: This article presents a model of hindered solute transport in a poroelastic shale, considering the effects of ionic transport and the chemical composition of the pore fluid. The model assumes that the shale behaves as an imperfect ion-exclusion membrane and uses the concept of reflection and transmission coefficients to predict the time-dependent flow of a compressible fluid through the shale. The analysis provides insights into the swelling of shales and the stresses and strains around a swelling wellbore during oil drilling.
