tldr: Mr. Paschall observed the births and deaths of humans and animals in relation to lunar cycles and tides. He found that most births and deaths occurred during the ebbing tide, while motion, vigor, and strength were more prevalent during the tiding time. This led him to believe that there might be a connection between lunar cycles and natural phenomena.
