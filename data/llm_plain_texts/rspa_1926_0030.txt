tldr: The authors describe the synthesis and properties of antimonial analogues of the cacodyl series, focusing on trimethylstibine and dimethylstibine compounds. They discuss the preparation of these compounds, their reactions, and their comparison with arsenic-based cacodyl compounds. The research contributes to the understanding of organometallic chemistry and the chemistry of compound radicals.
