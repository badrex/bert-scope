tldr: The authors describe the structure and reactivity of halogenobenzenes by analyzing the inductive and mesomeric effects of electronegative substituents. They calculate the dipole moments of halogenobenzenes and correlate the data on aromatic compound reactions with nitration to estimate the charge distribution in the nucleus. The study provides a starting point for understanding the reactivity of halogenobenzenes and offers insights into the structure and substitution of aromatic molecules.
