tldr: The author extends Dr. Salmon's theory of reciprocal surfaces, introducing new singularities and modifications to the original formulae. They discuss cnicnodes, binodes, pinch-points, close-points, and off-points on the nodal and cuspidal curves of a surface, and explain how these singularities affect the properties of reciprocal surfaces and their Hessian surfaces.
