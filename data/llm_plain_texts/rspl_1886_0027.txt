tldr: The authors developed a method to compare the intensity of lights of different colors and applied it to study color blindness. They found that color-blind individuals perceive less intensity of illumination compared to normal-eyed people and have different curves of luminosity. The authors also compared their results with Vierordt's curve and discussed the effect of turbidity on light intensity.
