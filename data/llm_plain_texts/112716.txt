tldr: The author, J. Norman Lockyer, conducted spectroscopic observations of the Sun and discovered new facts about the chromosphere, prominences, and solar atmosphere. He found traces of magnesium and iron in the chromosphere and suspected that the chromosphere might have lost some of its height. Lockyer's observations supported the theory that the chromosphere and photosphere form the true atmosphere of the sun, while opposing some claims made by Father Secchi.
