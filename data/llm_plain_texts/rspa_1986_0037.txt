tldr: The authors used thermal desorption and electron energy loss spectroscopy to study the structures of unsaturated hydrocarbons chemisorbed on metal single-crystal surfaces, focusing on alk-1-enes and isobutene on Pt(111). They found that at low temperatures, the alk-1-enes form di-cr-bonded non-dissociatively adsorbed species. At higher temperatures, alkylidyne structures and further hydrogen loss were observed. The study provides insights into the adsorption and desorption processes of unsaturated hydrocarbons on metal surfaces.
