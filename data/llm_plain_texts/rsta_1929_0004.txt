tldr: The authors, J. A. Gaunt and R. H. Fowler, explore the triplets of helium and the spin effects in atomic physics using Dirac's recent theory. They calculate spin separations and wave-functions, finding results that agree with experimental data. The study focuses on the interactions between electrons in helium atoms and the impact of spin on these interactions.
