tldr: The article discusses the role of apoptosis in development, tissue homeostasis, and malignancy, focusing on the c-myc oncogene's ability to regulate cell proliferation and cell death. The authors explain that c-myc can act as a potent inducer of apoptosis, which occurs only in cells deprived of growth factors or forcibly arrested with cytostatic drugs. They also highlight the importance of the c-Myc's partner, Max, in controlling both mitogenic and apoptotic functions of c-Myc through a transcriptional mechanism.
