tldr: This article presents a method for finding the value of algebraic expressions involving several radical quantities in an infinite series. The author demonstrates how to apply Sir Isaac Newton's theorem for involving a binomial and relates it to the roots of equations. The method is useful for solving complex mathematical problems and improving computation techniques.
