tldr: Dr. Wallis discusses a new musical discovery where strings on musical instruments vibrate in response to other strings being played in unison or consonant intervals. This phenomenon occurs due to the simultaneous vibrations of the unison parts of the strings. The author also mentions that this effect can be observed in wind instruments and possibly in other materials like glass.
