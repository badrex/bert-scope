tldr: The authors extended and corrected the analysis of the 'complex' spectrum of Hg 111, identifying new terms and revising existing ones. They used spectrograms and a Fabry-Perot interferometer to study the isotope shifts and hyperfine structures in the spectrum, providing a more accurate understanding of the term structure and its implications for the interpretation of isotope shifts and associated hyperfine structures.
