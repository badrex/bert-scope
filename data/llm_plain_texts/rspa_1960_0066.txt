tldr: The authors develop the optical model of light nuclei, a theoretical framework used to understand the elastic scattering of particles in nuclear reactions. They apply this model to K+-proton scattering and discuss the potential's short range and the significance of the s-state in the interaction. The authors also explore the effects of two-nucleon correlations on the shape of the K+ meson optical model potential.
