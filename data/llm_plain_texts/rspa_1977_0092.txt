tldr: The authors conducted experiments on decane-air mixtures to study the spontaneous ignition limits of hydrocarbon-oxygen mixtures. They applied thermal ignition theory to predict temperature limits under conditions with and without convective heat transfer. The results showed that the overall activation energy of the initial reactions involved in the oxidation of alkanes can be used to predict corresponding spontaneous ignition temperature limits.
