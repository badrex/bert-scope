tldr: The authors studied the cytological features of fertilization in Pinus Silvestris, a type of conifer. They observed the process of fertilization, the formation of the neck cells, and the role of the ventral canal cell. The research also involved counting chromosomes in various cells and tissues of the plant. The findings contribute to the understanding of plant reproduction and the development of the oophyte.
