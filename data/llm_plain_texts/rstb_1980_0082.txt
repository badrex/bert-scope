tldr: The article discusses three distinct types of visual persistence: visible persistence, neural persistence, and iconic memory. Visible persistence refers to the sensation experienced after a visual stimulus has been removed, neural persistence is the continuation of neural activity after the stimulus has been removed, and iconic memory is the temporary storage of visual information after the stimulus has been removed. The author argues that these three types of persistence are not different manifestations of a single entity and should be studied separately.
