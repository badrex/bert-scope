tldr: Edward Wortley Montagu discovered a Vespasian medal embedded in Pompey's Pillar in Egypt. The reversed hieroglyphics and the presence of the medal suggest that the pillar was not erected during Pompey's time and was likely built to honor Emperor Vespasian. Montagu shared his findings with the Royal Society and the Society of Antiquaries.
