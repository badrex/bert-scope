tldr: The authors studied the structure and assembly of bacterial surface layers composed of regular arrays of subunits, focusing on the Gram-negative bacterium Acinetobacter strain MJT/F5/199A. They found that the surface subunits can be detached and reassemble spontaneously, forming the same regular pattern as on the intact bacterium. The study provides insights into the formation and function of surface layers in bacteria.
