tldr: Edward Sabine conducted experiments to determine the correction for temperature variations of the invariable pendulum in the South of England's natural climate. He found that 0.44 vibrations per day is the correction for each degree Fahrenheit between 300 and 60. Sabine suggests that further experiments in artificial temperatures are needed for more accurate results.
