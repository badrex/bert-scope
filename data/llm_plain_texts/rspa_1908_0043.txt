tldr: 'The author discusses the discovery and properties of scandium, a rare earth element. Scandium was discovered in 1879 and has an extremely characteristic group of lines in its spectrum. The author found scandium in various rare earth minerals, with wiikite containing the highest amount. The exact separation of components in wiikite is challenging, but its composition is estimated to be tantalic acid with some niobic acid. The author also prepared and analyzed scandium compounds, such as scandium hydroxide.'
