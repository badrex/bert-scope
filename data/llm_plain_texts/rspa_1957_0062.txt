tldr: The article presents a method for solving plane problems in second-order elasticity theory, focusing on infinite bodies with internal boundaries. The authors develop a complex variable notation approach to derive expressions for force and couple resultants on internal boundaries and examine the nature of the solution for stress and strain at infinity. The theory is applied to problems involving uniform stress and displacement distributions along internal circular boundaries and at infinity.
