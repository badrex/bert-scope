tldr: The author analyzes the mathematical aspects of the zenith-light method for studying ozone distribution in the atmosphere. They focus on primary scattered light and examine special cases of ozone distribution, such as uniformly exponential atmospheres and atmospheres with varying air density. The study aims to improve our understanding of the method and its applications to atmospheric problems, including radio waves scattered and absorbed in the ionosphere.
