tldr: This article presents a detailed catalogue of the eclipses of Jupiter's four satellites for the year 1732. The author, James Hodgson, provides instructions for observing these events and emphasizes the importance of these observations for determining the longitude of places on Earth. He also discusses the regularity of the eclipse patterns and the lack of light emitted by Jupiter and its satellites, which must be borrowed from the Sun.
