tldr: The spherical shell nuclear model, proposed by H. A. Wilson, explores new energy levels due to the interaction of vibrations and rotation. The model is applied to aluminum-28 and silicon-28, showing good agreement with predicted values. The study suggests that the spherical shell model can explain the observed energy levels of certain isotopes, providing insight into the behavior of atomic nuclei.
