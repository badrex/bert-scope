tldr: The study investigates the aggregation behavior of three-spined sticklebacks in response to fright stimuli. The researchers found that the fish prefer to approach larger display shoals, and the magnitude of this preference increases with the difference in display shoal size. The aggregation behavior is both density and distance dependent. The study also introduces several models to explore how distance and display shoal size contribute to total risk and reveals a fundamental perceptual limit, known as numerosity, for shoal size discrimination.
