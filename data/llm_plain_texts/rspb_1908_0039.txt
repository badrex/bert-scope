revised_title: 'Investigating Hydrochloric Acid Secretion in Mice and Rats with Cancer'

tldr: Researchers studied the secretion of hydrochloric acid in the stomachs of mice and rats with cancer and found an increase in the amount of physiologically active hydrochloric acid in the gastric contents of mice with transplanted tumors compared to normal mice. This discovery could have implications for understanding cancer and its effects on the body.
