tldr: The authors analyze the dipole moments of aromatic compounds, such as anisoles, phenols, and anilines, to determine the bond moments and the effect of substituents on the molecules. They find that the observed dipole moments are not solely due to the vector summation of the constituent dipole moments, but also have an additional moment attributed to electronic redistribution in the molecule. This study helps in understanding the molecular structure and properties of aromatic compounds.
