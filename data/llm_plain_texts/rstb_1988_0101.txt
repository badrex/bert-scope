tldr: This article discusses the long-range dispersal of cereal aphids, specifically the corn-leaf aphid and the green bug, as virus vectors in North America. The authors review studies on the reinvasion phenomenon, including the use of radar and traps on helicopters to detect aphids in flight. They emphasize the importance of understanding long-range dispersal for disease control strategies and discuss the biological and economic significance of this phenomenon.
