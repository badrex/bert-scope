tldr: This article explores the use of specific heat-temperature curves to study age-hardening alloys and understand the thermal effects and precipitation processes involved in their hardening. The authors investigate five different age-hardening alloys and find that the technique provides valuable information about the extent of precipitation and the effectiveness of heat treatment in maximizing hardness.
