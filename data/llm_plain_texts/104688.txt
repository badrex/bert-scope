tldr: This case study describes the extirpation of an excrescence from a patient's womb. The author, John Burton, details the symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of the patient, including the use of ligature and internal medicines. The excrescence was found to be solid, dark liver-colored, and similar in substance to cancerous tissue. The patient's recovery was partial, as she still experienced health issues and the "fluor albus" or white discharge.
