tldr: The authors studied the first maiotic division in various animals and plants, focusing on the forms assumed by the gemini (heterotype chromosomes). They discovered that six constant forms of gemini co-exist in every instance of the first maiotic division, and these forms are present before the spindle fibers have acted on them. This finding challenges existing conceptions about the nature of gemini forms and raises questions about the wider implications of these findings.
