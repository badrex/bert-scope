tldr: This article discusses the historical development of nitrogen fixation research, from its early beginnings in 1932 to the discovery of hydrogenase and the use of 15N2 as a tracer. It highlights key milestones, such as the identification of nitrogen-fixing bacteria and the understanding of the chemical pathway involved in nitrogen fixation. The article also emphasizes the importance of these discoveries in expanding the list of known nitrogen-fixing organisms and advancing our knowledge of the process.
