tldr: This article investigates the strength, fracture, and erosion properties of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) diamond thin films. The authors explore the effects of high modulus coatings on stress fields generated by indentation and impact, and examine various techniques to measure the physical properties of CVD diamond layers. The erosion properties of both CVD-coated substrates and free-standing layers are also studied for liquid drop and solid particle erosion. The research highlights the potential of high modulus coatings and the importance of measuring key properties for optimizing CVD processes.
