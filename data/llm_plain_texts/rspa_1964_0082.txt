tldr: The authors conducted experiments using reflecting telescopes to observe millimeter-wave radiation from the sun, moon, and atmosphere. They studied the absorption of electromagnetic radiation by water vapor and oxygen, and discovered that collision-induced absorption by non-polar gases, such as nitrogen and oxygen, could be responsible for significant atmospheric attenuation of millimeter radiation. These findings have implications for understanding the energy balance of the atmosphere and the properties of celestial bodies.
