tldr: 'This article discusses the role of sulphur bacteria in the geological significance of sulphur oxidoreduction. It examines how these bacteria contribute to the geochemical cycling of sulphur, and their impact on the environment. The article also explores the challenges in diagnosing past activities of sulphur bacteria through chemical precipitates and isotopic data.'
