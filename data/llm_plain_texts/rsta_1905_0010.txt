tldr: This article presents an analysis of the results from the Falmouth magnetographs on "quiet" days during the twelve years from 1891 to 1902. The author compares the data from Falmouth Observatory with that from Kew Observatory, discussing the behavior of the vertical-force magnetograph, declination, and horizontal-force magnetographs. The study examines the annual changes in declination and horizontal force, as well as the non-cyclic effects and their possible connection with magnetic storms and solar activity.
