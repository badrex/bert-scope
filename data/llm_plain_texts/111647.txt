tldr: The author, P. Griess, describes a new method of substitution to form iodobenzoic, iodotoluylic, and iodanisic acids. These new acids undergo remarkable changes, such as the transformation produced by mineral acids. The author also discusses the synthesis of chlorozenzoic acid and the stability of jodobenzoic acid. Further experiments are needed to determine the preferred formula for these compounds.
