revised_title: Surface Wave Analysis in Polythermal Glacier Flow
semantic_tags:
  - Glaciology
  - Surface waves
  - Ice flow
  - Kinematic waves
  - Nonlinear hyperbolic equations
tldr: The authors develop a nonlinear hyperbolic equation to describe the passage of kinematic waves along the surface of valley glaciers. They analyze surface wave behavior and the formation and evolution of surface shocks, providing a more accurate understanding of large-scale snout movements.
