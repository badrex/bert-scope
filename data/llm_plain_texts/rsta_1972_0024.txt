tldr: This article discusses the relationship between winds and temperatures in the auroral zone and their connection to geomagnetic activity. The authors found a strong correlation between east-west neutral wind speed and the mean local south-north ground magnetic perturbation. They also discovered that ionospheric electric fields and electron density drive the auroral electrojet and accelerate the neutral gas via ion-neutral collisions. These wind disturbances can propagate to mid-latitudes in the night hemisphere, leading to anomalously high neutral wind speeds during geomagnetic storm conditions.
