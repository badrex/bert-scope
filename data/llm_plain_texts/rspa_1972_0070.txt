tldr: This article explores the microstructure of ionic melts, focusing on molten alkali halides, using computer simulation techniques. The authors describe the radial distribution functions and fluctuation functions, providing a quantitative analysis of the local structure in ionic melts. Their findings challenge the agreement between theoretical models and experimental data, suggesting that further improvements are needed for a better understanding of molten salt systems.
