tldr: The authors conducted geophysical studies on the Seychelles Bank, analyzing seismic refraction and gravity profiles. They discovered that the crust beneath the central part of the bank has a continental character and thickness, suggesting that the entire Seychelles Bank may represent a small continental fragment. The findings challenge previous theories about the origin of the bank and provide insights into its geological history.
