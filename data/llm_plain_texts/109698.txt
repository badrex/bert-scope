tldr: Humphry Davy conducted experiments to determine the decomposition of nitrogen in ammonia by potassium. He found that when potassium reacts with ammonia, a part of the ammonia disappears, and a quantity of hydrogen is evolved. The results suggest that a decomposition of nitrogen has been effected, and further research is needed to understand the process.
