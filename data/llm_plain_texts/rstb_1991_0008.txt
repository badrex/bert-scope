tldr: The authors conducted experiments with a random pattern of bright and dark squares on an oscilloscope screen to test the directional motion-detector neurons in insects. They found that when the contrast was reversed at the jump, the response was the same for both directions, indicating a non-directional 'on' or 'off' response. This result challenges the autocorrelation theory of directional motion perception in insects.
