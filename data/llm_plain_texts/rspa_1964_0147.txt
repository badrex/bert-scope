semantic_tags:

  - Crystallography
tldr: The author presents a new approach to understanding the structure of liquids, focusing on the role of molecular interactions and repulsive forces. They criticize existing theories and propose a more concrete and homologous theory to the crystalline solid, without the assumption of long-range order or special groups. The author also discusses the limitations of current theories and the importance of using Ockham's razor in developing a new theory.
