tldr: Researchers discovered that when Bacillus coli communis is grown in the presence of chloroacetate, some strains lose the ability to produce gas from glucose. This change in the bacterial strain's chemical action results in an increased proportion of lactic acid and a diminished proportion of other products. The study of these selected organisms could provide valuable insights into the nature of fermentation processes and bacterial metabolism.
