tldr: This study assesses the North Atlantic's role as a carbon dioxide sink, finding that it absorbs 0.2 to 0.5 gigatons of CO2 annually. The North Atlantic's high-latitude regions and adjacent seas act as net sinks, while the temperate North Atlantic areas' sink flux is balanced by the source flux over the tropical Atlantic.
