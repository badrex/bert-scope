tldr: The study investigates the basal dendrites of Meynert cells in the striate cortex of the macaque monkey. It finds that the dendritic fields are generally elliptical, with an average area of 0.13 mmÂ². The orientation of the dendritic fields correlates with the directions of ocular dominance bands, suggesting that Meynert cells may play a role in processing visual information. The research also provides insights into the organization of hypercolumns in the visual cortex.
