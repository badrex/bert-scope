tldr: 'This study investigates the factors affecting the number of plant species on the islands of Aldabra Atoll. The logarithm of island area, along with two components of island altitude, significantly contribute to the variance in plant species numbers. The findings suggest that island area is the primary determinant of plant species number, with altitude and rock type also playing a role. The study highlights the importance of understanding the ecological factors that influence plant species distribution on islands.'
