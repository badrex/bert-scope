tldr: The authors studied the life history and germination of Plasmodiophora brassicae, a fungus causing clubroot disease in crucifers. They observed the germination process and the root hair stages of the fungus in Brassica rapa seedling roots. The findings suggest a complete life history for the organism, including nuclear fusion in the secondary phase, which helps in understanding the development of clubroot disease.
