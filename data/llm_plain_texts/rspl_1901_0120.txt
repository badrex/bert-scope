tldr: The author examines the chemical origins of the lines in Nova Persei and compares them with other celestial and terrestrial spectra. They conclude that the temperatures reached in the outbursts of Novae are not greatly different from those of certain stars and that the conditions in these stars are similar to the temporary conditions that produce the appearance of Novae.
