tldr: 'The author observed that whales, particularly fat individuals, have a film of yellowish color on their skin. Upon examining the film, they found it to consist of large numbers of diatoms, a type of algae. This discovery led the author to investigate the relationship between diatoms and whales, and the potential use of diatoms as a tool to trace whale migrations.'
