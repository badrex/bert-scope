tldr: Dr. Edmund Halley examines extraordinary meteors and lights in the sky, calculating their heights and velocities. He discusses the possible origins of these phenomena, suggesting that they may be caused by the ignition of rarefied vapors in the Earth's atmosphere. Halley also compares his observations to a similar event in Germany, emphasizing the importance of further study to better understand these meteorological events.
