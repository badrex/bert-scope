tldr: The author studied the polymorphism of Trypanosoma gambiense in the blood and its relation to the endogenous and exogenous cycles. They found that the multiplication of the trypanosomes occurs in the circulating blood-stream, and the fluctuations in their numbers are influenced by factors from both the vertebrate host and the parasite. The author also investigated the relationship between the trypanosome polymorphism and the production of infected flies, which play a role in the exogenous cycle.
