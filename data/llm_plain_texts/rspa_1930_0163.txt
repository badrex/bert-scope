tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the intensity of friction on the surface of an aerofoil. They used surface tubes to measure the velocity close to the surface and found that the frictional drag of the aerofoil could be predicted from the changes of momentum along the boundary layer. This research helped improve understanding of fluid dynamics and aerofoil design.
