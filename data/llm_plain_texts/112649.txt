tldr: The author conducted experiments on two healthy soldiers to study the elimination of nitrogen by the kidneys and intestines during rest and exercise on a non-nitrogenous diet. They found that the urinary excretion of nitrogen was fairly constant, and the intestinal excretion played a role in nitrogen elimination. During rest, the excretion of nitrogen decreased significantly, indicating that the body's tissues were breaking down and providing nitrogen for the body's needs.
