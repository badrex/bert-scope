tldr: The author, Daniel Coxe, conducted experiments to understand the nature of alcalizate or fixed salts in plants and their pre-existence. He found that these salts do not pre-exist in plants before they are exposed to fire. Coxe also investigated the process by which fire produces alcali salts and proposed that they result from the combination or union of saline and sulphureous principles.
