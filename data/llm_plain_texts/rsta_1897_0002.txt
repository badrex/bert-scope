tldr: This article presents the complete freezing-point curves of binary alloys containing silver, copper, or other metals. The authors describe the experimental methods used to determine the freezing points and discuss the equilibrium between liquid mixtures and various solids that can form from them. They also explain the concept of eutectic alloys and the phenomenon of double freezing points. This research contributes to the understanding of the properties and behavior of metallic alloys.
