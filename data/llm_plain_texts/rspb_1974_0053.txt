revised_title: 'The Effects of Sporidesmin and Icterogenin on Bile Secretion in Isolated Perfused Rat Livers'
semantic_tags:
  - Bile secretion
  - Cholestasis
  - Liver perfusion
  - Sporidesmin
  - Icterogenin
tldr: The authors used an isolated perfused rat liver model to study the cholestatic effects of sporidesmin and icterogenin on bile secretion. Both agents rapidly caused cholestasis and significant changes in the canalicular membrane. The study suggests that bile flow in rats is affected by disturbances to the canalicular membrane, and preliminary biochemical investigations of these disturbances are reported.
