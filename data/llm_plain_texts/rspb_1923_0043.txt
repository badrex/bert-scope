tldr: The study investigates the immediate changes in tissue cells after exposure to soft X-rays while growing in vitro. The researchers found that longer exposure times led to abnormalities in cell division, including granular changes, chromosome fragmentation, and lag in division. The study also observed changes in the nuclei and nucleoli of fully formed cells, such as enlargement, decreased density, and granular appearance. These findings contribute to understanding the effects of radiation on living cells.
