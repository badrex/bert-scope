tldr: The authors studied the absorption spectra of mixed metallic vapours, specifically sodium and potassium. They discovered a new band spectrum in the yellow, which they attributed to the presence of sodium-potassium molecules in the mixed vapour. The study also included observations on the continuous absorption of dense potassium vapour and the magnesium line X 4571 in absorption spectra.
