tldr: The author, James Ivory, investigates the disturbing function that affects the motions of planets due to their mutual attraction. He aims to provide a method for astronomers to compute the coefficients of these inequalities, which can have a significant impact on planetary motions. The method can be extended to any order, making it a valuable tool for understanding celestial mechanics.
