tldr: The author examines the histological structure of cod skin and compares it to mammalian skin, revealing differences in their fibrous structure and resistance to mechanical shock. Cod skin is more susceptible to disintegration in acid and alkaline solutions due to its unique arrangement of collagen fibers. Drying and chemical treatments also affect the skin's structure and collagen degradation.
