tldr: The author examines the unique rhythmic eruptions of Stromboli, a volcano that has been observed for over 2000 years. Unlike other volcanoes, Stromboli's eruptions are regular and have a moderate level of violence. The author explores the physical and mechanical conditions that create this distinct rhythm and discusses the connection between Stromboli's eruptions and geysers. They conclude that changes in atmospheric pressure do not cause the rhythmic eruptions and that a different mechanism must be responsible for this curious phenomenon.
