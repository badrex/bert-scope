revised_title: 'Hydrogen Atomic Reactions and Incandescence'
semantic_tags:
  - Atomic hydrogen
  - Spectral lines
  - Surface reactions
  - Catalytic action
  - Incandescence
tldr: The author's experiments with atomic hydrogen gas reveal that the presence of water vapor or oxygen is necessary to suppress the secondary spectrum and bring out the atomic spectrum. The heating of tungsten and platinum wires in the gas is due to the catalytic action of their surfaces in recombining hydrogen atoms. The author also discusses the generation of molecular hydrogen from atomic hydrogen and the role of oxygen in preventing the formation of atomic hydrogen.
