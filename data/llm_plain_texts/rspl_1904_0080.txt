revised_title: The Physical Relation of Chloroform to Blood
semantic_tags:
  - Blood chemistry
  - Chloroform

  - Gas absorption
  - Lipoid theory
tldr: This article investigates the relationship between chloroform and blood, finding that blood has a greater affinity for chloroform than water. Blood acts as a temporary medium that helps control the process of anaesthesia, acting as a chloroform reservoir. The absorption of chloroform by blood does not follow Henry's law, and the combination between chloroform and protoplasm may be explained by the lipoid theory.
