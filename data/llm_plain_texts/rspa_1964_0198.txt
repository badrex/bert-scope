tldr: The authors present results from the Alouette satellite, a topside sounder, to study the structure and behavior of the upper ionosphere. They find that the ionosphere cools and contracts during the night, and investigate the geomagnetic equatorial anomaly. The study also observes localized phenomena related to radiation belts and their effects on the atmosphere.
