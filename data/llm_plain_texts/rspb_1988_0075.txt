tldr: The authors studied the vegetation and soil types of the Morro de FumaÃ§a, a hill in eastern Mato Grosso, Brazil. They found a variety of vegetation types, including deciduous forest, mesotrophic facies cerradao, and open cerrado, and analyzed the soil properties associated with each. The study provides valuable information on the increasingly endangered deciduous forests of Brazil.
