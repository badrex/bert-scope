tldr: The spherical Fabry-Perot interferometer is an instrument with high resolving power that can be used with external or internal atomic beams. It was designed to overcome the limitations of the normal Fabry-Perot interferometer, offering greater light power at high resolution and lower requirements for accuracy of adjustment. The instrument has been successfully used to resolve structure in the resonance line of the arc spectrum of barium.
