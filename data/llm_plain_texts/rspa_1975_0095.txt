tldr: The article discusses the intersection of potential energy surfaces in polyatomic molecules. It proves that if the wave function of a given electronic state changes sign when transported adiabatically around a loop in nuclear configuration space, the state must become degenerate with another one at some point within the loop. The author also shows that this condition applies to certain unsymmetrical polyatomic systems, such as a system of three dissimilar hydrogen-like atoms, which disposes of the claim that potential energy surfaces of polyatomic molecules will only intersect when symmetry dictates the vanishing of the interaction between them.
