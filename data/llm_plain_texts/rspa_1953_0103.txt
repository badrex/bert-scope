tldr: The authors studied the growth patterns and molecular structure of crystals of n-nonatriacontane and stearic acid using electron microscopy. They found that the height of growth-steps in these crystals is determined by the size of the molecular units in solution rather than the length of the parent dislocation. The results provide evidence that crystals with flat surfaces can be produced by a mechanism based on screw dislocations.
