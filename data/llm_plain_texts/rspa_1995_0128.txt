tldr: The authors investigate the instability modes of high-frequency and high-wavenumber in boundary layers with local flow reversal. They focus on the two-dimensional unsteady boundary layer and show that reversed flow first appears at the wall. The order of appearance of instability modes is found to be marginal modes first, followed by intermediate modes, and then off-wall modes. The study provides insight into airfoil stall and vortex ejections, as well as the role of flow reversal and velocity minimum in the local stability features and short-length growth rates.
