tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the refractive indices and molecular refractions of prussic acid and its homologues. They found that the observed molecular refractions of the acid agreed closely with those extrapolated from the homologous cyanides, but differed from the values calculated from the isocyanides. This study provided insights into the molecular structure and physical properties of prussic acid.
