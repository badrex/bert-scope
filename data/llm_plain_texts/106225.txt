tldr: 'The author, Mr. Marsham, conducted an experiment to determine the impact of washing and rubbing tree stems on their growth. He found that washing the tree stems significantly increased the growth rate of the beech trees compared to those left unwashed. The washed trees grew 9/10ths and an half more than the unwashed trees, demonstrating the effectiveness of this method in promoting tree growth.'
