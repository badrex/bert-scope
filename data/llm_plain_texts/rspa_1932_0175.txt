tldr: This article investigates the distribution of suspended particles under gravity and examines the discrepancies between various experimental results. The authors argue that the simple exponential formula cannot hold in regions where particles occupy a significant fraction of the total volume and question whether the laws of dilute solutions break down completely at low concentrations. They also criticize the experimental methods used in some studies, emphasizing the importance of ensuring equilibrium before measuring particle concentrations.
