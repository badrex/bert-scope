tldr: This article explores the tension of composite fluid surfaces and the behavior of fluids when spread on another. The author discusses the equilibrium state, the role of molecular forces, and the spreading of fluids on water. The study also examines the phenomena of unstable sponges, films, and lenses, and their relation to the colloidal state and gelation.
