tldr: The author, W. Snow Harris, improved the balance of torsion invented by Coulomb to measure small forces of repulsion in electricity and magnetism. They created a new type of balance called a bifile balance, which relies on gravity instead of elasticity. The author conducted experiments to study the elementary laws of electricity and discovered that the time of oscillation is independent of the weight of the oscillating body and isochronous at all angles.
