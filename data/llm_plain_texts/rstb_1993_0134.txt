tldr: The article discusses the CD4 molecule and its role in the immune system, specifically focusing on the subsets of CD4+ T cells and their functions in autoimmunity. The author explains how CD4+ T cells are heterogeneous and that different subsets mediate different immunological functions. One subset plays a crucial role in preventing autoimmunity, indicating that self-tolerance cannot be entirely explained by the deletion or inactivation of autoreactive T cells. The potential therapeutic uses of monoclonal antibodies are also explored, as they can inhibit the activation of CD4+ T cells involved in autoimmune diseases.
