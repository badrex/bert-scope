tldr: The authors developed a method to measure the amplitude and velocity distribution of sound waves in pipes using a hot-wire anemometer. They found that the simple sine relation for the change of velocity or displacement amplitude along the pipe is not satisfied near the mouth and for a considerable distance along the pipe. The motion suffers a rapid magnification as the mouth is approached due to the circulation of vortices at the mouth, which contribute nothing to the pressure variations in the pipe itself.
