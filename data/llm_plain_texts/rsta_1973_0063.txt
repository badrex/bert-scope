tldr: This article discusses the measurement and interpretation of changes in strain during fault creep in the Earth. The authors analyze data from a dense network of creepmeters along the San Andreas fault system in central California. They find that fault creep is a failure phenomenon, kinematically similar to seismic faulting, but with much lower rates. The study also reveals that the tectonic strain released by a creep event can be significant, with some events having rupture lengths and offsets comparable to those of shallow earthquakes.
