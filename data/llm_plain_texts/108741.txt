tldr: The author, Carlo Matteucci, conducted experiments to study the secondary electromotor power of nerves and its application in electro-physiological phenomena. He discovered that when a nerve is traversed by an electric current, it acquires a secondary electromotor power, which can produce an electric current in a contrary direction to the exciting current. This property is connected to the nerve's structure and ceases when its integrity is impaired. The author also developed a method for comparing the electromotor power of different animal parts, which can be useful in further electro-physiological research.
