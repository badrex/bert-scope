tldr: The author investigates the conductivity of gases under Becquerel rays and measures the ionization produced by radiation from various radioactive substances. They find that the radiation from radium and polonium has two distinct types: one easily absorbed by solids or gases and the other more penetrating and deflectable by a magnet. The study focuses on the easily absorbed type of radiation and its effects on gas conductivity.
