tldr: The authors used the ion probe technique to analyze trace element distributions in meteorites, focusing on nickel in olivine in pallasites. They found that the concentration of nickel in olivine is lower than in terrestrial olivines and that the ion probe results provide a more accurate measurement of nickel content. The authors discuss the implications of their findings on the thermal history of pallasites and the potential for independent establishment of olivine and metal compositions before the formation of the pallasite structure.
