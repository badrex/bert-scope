tldr: The authors studied the molecular structure and elastic properties of hair keratin using X-ray fiber photography. They found that stretched hair has a similar structure to natural silk, with polypeptide chains in an extended state, while unstretched hair has chains in a folded state. The elastic properties of hair are due to a reversible intra-molecular transformation. The structure of keratin involves secondary and primary folds in the main-chains and side-chains, which contribute to its elasticity. The authors also discussed the effects of water, steam, and dilute caustic soda on the keratin structure and the role of side-chain linkages in hair set and super-contraction.
