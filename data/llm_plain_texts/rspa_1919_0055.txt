tldr: This article presents a theoretical and experimental study of gas adsorption at low and moderate concentrations. The authors develop a formula for adsorption that applies to gases up to moderate adsorptions and examine the adsorption isosteres and isotherms. The results show a close agreement between the theoretical formula and experimental observations, demonstrating the validity of the assumptions made in the simple theory.
