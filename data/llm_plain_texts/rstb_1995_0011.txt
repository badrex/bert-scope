semantic_tags:
  - DNA repair
  - Nucleotide excision repair
  - DNA damage recognition
  - DNA replication
  - Human inherited syndromes
tldr: The article discusses the proteins involved in nucleotide excision repair, a versatile DNA repair mechanism in mammalian cells. It highlights the importance of this process in removing DNA damage caused by ultraviolet light and other factors. The article also explains the relationship between nucleotide excision repair and human inherited syndromes like xeroderma pigmentosum, Cockayne's syndrome, and trichothiodystrophy.
