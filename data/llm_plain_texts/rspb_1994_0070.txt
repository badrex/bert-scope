tldr: This study examines the genetic variation within populations of the intertidal isopod Jaera albifrons in South Wales. The research finds remarkable genetic divergence between populations separated by less than 5 meters. The study suggests that restricted gene flow, along with direct development and patchy habitat distribution, contributes to the observed microgeographic genetic differentiation. The findings highlight the importance of life history and local environmental conditions in shaping population divergence.
