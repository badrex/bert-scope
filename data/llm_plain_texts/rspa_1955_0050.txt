tldr: This study measures the burning velocities of various gas mixtures, including methane, ethane, propane, butane, ethylene, carbon monoxide, and cyanogen, using a flat-flame burner method. The results show a straight-line relationship between composition and burning velocity, except for carbon monoxide mixtures. The findings can help explain the behavior of flames and improve our understanding of combustion processes.
