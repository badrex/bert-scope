tldr: The authors studied the behavior of liquids with rotational isomerism under the influence of sound waves of varying frequencies. They focused on unsaturated aldehydes and ketones and found that the observed relaxational behavior is attributed to the perturbation of an equilibrium between rotational isomers. The results confirm the intramolecular nature of the reaction, as the potential barrier to rotation is predominantly determined by forces within the molecule and is relatively independent of surrounding solvent molecules.
