tldr: This article presents harmonic tidal constants for various Chinese and New Zealand ports, obtained through the analysis of high and low water observations. The author discusses the methods used to determine these constants and tests their accuracy by comparing computed and observed heights of water. The results provide a basis for predicting tides at these ports and understanding the tidal patterns in the region.
