tldr: The authors determined the crystal structure of cobyric acid, a precursor of vitamin B12, using X-ray crystallography and anomalous dispersion methods. They found that the structure is less complicated than that of the vitamins, providing a better understanding of the corrin nucleus, the central part of the molecule. This research contributes to the study of vitamin B12 and its related compounds.
