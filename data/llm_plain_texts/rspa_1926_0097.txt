tldr: 'The authors conducted a spectroscopic analysis of the arc and spark spectra of palladium, identifying various spectral terms and their configurations. They found that the normal state of the palladium atom is represented by the term (4), and that the metastable terms are those involving the configuration (4). The authors also discussed the series systems and limits of the palladium spectrum, providing insights into the atomic structure and energy levels of the palladium atom.'
