tldr: The authors present a method for solving the secular equation for surface waves in anisotropic media, reducing it to a generalized eigenvalue problem. They discuss the different types of surface waves, such as Rayleigh waves, organ-pipe modes, and body-wave modes, and provide a numerical technique for finding their propagation velocities. This study has implications for understanding wave behavior in materials with complex structures.
