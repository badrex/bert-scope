tldr: The article presents an electrostatic model of a membrane ion pump, which explains how an ion channel with an electric dipolar structure can transport ions against concentration gradients. The model involves the conversion of ion binding sites' affinity for ions based on the approach of an external charged body, and the application of an oscillating electric field to pump cations unidirectionally. This model simulates the behavior of membrane ion pumps like -ATPase with both physiological and artificial ionic concentrations.
