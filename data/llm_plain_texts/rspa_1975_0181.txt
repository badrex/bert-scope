tldr: The authors propose a new mathematical and conceptual framework for describing quantum fields in curved space-times using the Klein-Gordon fields. They construct a *-algebra of field operators and reduce the problem of obtaining the required *-representation to selecting a suitable complex structure on the real vector space of the solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation. The authors introduce the energy requirement to extend quantum field theory to non-static space-times and provide a plausible extension for non-stationary space-times.
