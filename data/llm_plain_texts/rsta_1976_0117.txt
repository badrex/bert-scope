tldr: This article discusses the design implications for materials selection, focusing on weldability and toughness specifications for structural steels in Japan. It highlights the differences in approaches taken by the British and Japanese standards for carbon manganese steels and the importance of considering factors such as carbon equivalent, welding process, heat input, and pre-heat levels. The article also emphasizes the flexibility offered by the development of standards by non-government organizations like the Japanese Welding Engineering Society.
