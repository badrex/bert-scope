tldr: The author, J. Norman Lockyer, conducted observations of the Orion Nebula's spectrum using a siderostat and a collimator. The observations confirmed the previous findings that the main nebula line coincides with the remnant of the fluting seen in the flame of burning magnesium. The author also discussed ongoing efforts to obtain photographs of the nebula's spectrum using the 30-inch reflector at Westgate-on-Sea.
