tldr: This article reviews neuropsychological studies on object recognition, focusing on the role of the right hemisphere in processing meaningful visual stimuli. The author argues that a wide range of perceptual deficits related to object recognition can be explained by faulty perceptual categorization at an early post-sensory stage. The concept of perceptual categorization is discussed within a tentative model of object recognition.
