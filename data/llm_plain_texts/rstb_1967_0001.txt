tldr: The article describes the development of the nervous system and other ectodermal derivatives in Tenebrio molitor, a beetle. It provides a detailed account of the formation of the ventral nerve cord, the brain, and the stomatogastric system, as well as the segmental affinities of these structures. The study is important for understanding head segmentation in insects and provides a foundation for future research on neurogenesis at the ultra-structural level.
