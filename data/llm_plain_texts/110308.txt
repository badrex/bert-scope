tldr: 'Dr. Davy conducted experiments on the Torpedo fish to study its electrical properties. He found that the fish's electricity is similar to common and voltaic electricity, and has the power to give magnetic polarity to steel, deflect the magnetic needle, and cause chemical changes in fluids. He also studied the anatomical structure of the fish's electrical organs and the surrounding muscles. The author suggests that the fish's electricity may be used for digestion and respiration, and that there may be a connection between the electrical and respiratory functions.'
