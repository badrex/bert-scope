tldr: The author investigates the sexuality and development of the ascocarp in Humaria granulata, a type of fungus that grows on animal dung. They discovered that the fungus reproduces through a unique process where the female nuclei in the ascogonium fuse in pairs, rather than undergoing fertilization by a male nucleus. This finding sheds light on the diverse reproductive processes within the Ascomycetes group.
