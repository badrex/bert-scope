tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the absorption of light at a specific wavelength (A) by luminous mercury vapor. They found that only the main component and satellites Nos. 6, 7, and 8 of the mercury green line were completely absorbed by the luminous vapor, while other satellites remained unaffected. This study provided insights into the constitution of the green line A and the behavior of different isotopes of mercury.
