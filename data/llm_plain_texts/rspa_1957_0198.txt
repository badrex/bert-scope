tldr: The author investigates the importance of coupling terms in the perturbed stationary state approximation for treating slow collisions between heavy particles. They find that the Born approximation overestimates cross-sections at high energies, and that coupling restricts the usefulness of the approximation to energies less than about 25 for long-range interactions and 7 for short-range interactions.
