tldr: The author investigates the thermal deformation of crystallized normal sulphates of potassium, rubidium, and cesium. They develop a new method for measuring the expansion of interference apparatus using a disc of indium, which allows for more accurate determination of the properties of solid substances, particularly crystals. The study focuses on the isomorphous series of normal sulphates, with a particular emphasis on the thermal expansion of each crystal.
