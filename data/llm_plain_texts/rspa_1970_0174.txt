tldr: This study investigates the motions of water molecules in dilute aqueous solutions of tertiary butyl alcohol using neutron scattering. The research finds that the solute enhances the water's structure, but it does not resemble ice. The findings provide insights into the nature of solute-water interactions and help answer questions about the properties of water and alkyl derivatives in solutions.
