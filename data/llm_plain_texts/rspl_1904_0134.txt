tldr: The authors investigated the cause of the period of chemical induction in the reaction between hydrogen and chlorine. They found that substances like ammonia and sulfur dioxide can prevent the reaction for a longer period. The study also showed that the mixture does not return to its inactive state after standing in the dark, debunking a previous assumption.
