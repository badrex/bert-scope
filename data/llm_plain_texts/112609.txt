tldr: The author, J. Clerk Maxwell, presents a dynamical theory of gases based on the assumption that molecules in motion act on each other with forces that are insensible except at short distances. The theory considers the mutual action of two molecules, two systems of molecules, and the final distribution of velocities among the molecules. The author also discusses the diffusion of gases, the coefficient of interdiffusion, and the rate of conduction of heat. The theory leads to the law of Equivalent Volumes and the determination of specific heats at constant volume and pressure.
