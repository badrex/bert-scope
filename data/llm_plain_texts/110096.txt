tldr: The author describes the transit instrument made by Mr. Dollond and its installation at the Cambridge Observatory. He discusses various methods for adjusting the instrument and detecting errors in its alignment. The author also shares an interesting observation of the instrument's line of collimation deviating due to the assistant's body heat affecting the lateral braces. To fix this issue, he recommends shielding the braces from the sun's rays.
