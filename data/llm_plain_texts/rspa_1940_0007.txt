tldr: The authors explore the photodisintegration of the deuteron using the meson theory, considering the interaction of a light quantum with the charged nuclear field. They calculate the cross-section for this process using Born's approximation and discuss the differences in the results compared to previous theories. The study highlights the importance of this phenomenon as a test for the meson theory.
