tldr: The author, Wm. Maitland, debates Mr. W. Kersseboom's claims that Paris had more inhabitants than London in the 17th century. Maitland argues that London's population was larger due to various factors, including religious divisions and the way christenings and burials were recorded. He also criticizes Kersseboom's methods of population estimation.
