tldr: This study used positron emission tomography (PET) to measure regional cerebral blood flow in six healthy volunteers during non-painful and painful thermal stimuli. The results showed significant increases in blood flow in the contralateral cingulate cortex, thalamus, and lenticular nucleus in response to painful heat compared to non-painful heat. These findings suggest that these areas play a role in the human pain response.
