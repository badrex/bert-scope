tldr: The authors present an expansion method for calculating atomic properties, providing a simpler and faster way to calculate expectation values of one-electron operators for any atom. The method uses uncoupled equations and offers accuracy comparable to the Hartree-Fock approximation. The authors apply this method to the helium and beryllium iso-electronic sequences, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential improvements as nuclear charge increases.
