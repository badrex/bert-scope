tldr: The authors investigate the motions at the top of the Earth's core responsible for the recent magnetic field variations. They analyze the secular variation of the geomagnetic field during 1950-1980 and find that the core's motions are dominated by a westward drift term. The study also reveals that the motions for lower modes are a strongly decreasing function of their order.
