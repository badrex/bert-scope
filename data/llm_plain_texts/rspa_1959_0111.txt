tldr: The authors determined the crystal structure of a hexacarboxylic acid obtained from vitamin B12 using X-ray crystallography. They found that the molecule has a large and irregular shape, packing in a manner reminiscent of cylindrical shapes. The study supports the formulation of the hexacarboxylic acid and provides insights into its molecular arrangement in the crystal.
