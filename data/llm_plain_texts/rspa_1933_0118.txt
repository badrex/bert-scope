tldr: The author presents a method for calculating atomic wave functions using the self-consistent field theory. They apply this method to chlorine and other atoms, providing detailed results for individual wave functions and contributions to the atomic field. This work improves upon earlier calculations and offers insights into the properties of elements in the periodic table.
