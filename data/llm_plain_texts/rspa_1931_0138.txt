tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the cathodic combustion of hydrogen-oxygen mixtures and studied the effects of diluents and sputtered metal particles on the combustion rate. They found that dilution with hydrogen increased the rate of combustion at non-sputtering cathodes, while at freely sputtering cathodes, the effect was less pronounced. The presence of sputtered metal particles reduced the life of excited hydrogen and oxygen, suggesting that they play a role in inhibiting the cathodic combustion process.
