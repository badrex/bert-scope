tldr: The author presents a new method for calculating the statical stability of ships using conic sections. The method allows for a more efficient calculation of a ship's stability, taking into account the center of buoyancy and the metacentre. This new approach can be used by anyone with a basic understanding of simple equilibrium, either algebraically or geometrically.
