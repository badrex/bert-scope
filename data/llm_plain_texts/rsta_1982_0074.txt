  - Magnetostratigraphy
tldr: This article discusses the geomagnetic polarity in the early Cretaceous and Jurassic periods, focusing on the M-sequence of marine magnetic anomalies. The authors use magnetostratigraphy to improve the dating of the oceanic crust and geomagnetic polarity epochs, providing a worldwide correlation tool for sedimentary stratigraphy.
