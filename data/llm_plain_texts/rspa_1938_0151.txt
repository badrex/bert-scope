revised_title: 'Effusion Phenomena in Relativistic Quantum Statistics: Degenerate and Non-Degenerate Matter'
semantic_tags:
  - Quantum Statistics
  - Relativistic Mechanics
  - Fermi-Dirac Statistics
  - Bose-Einstein Statistics
  - Effusion
tldr: The authors investigate the effusion phenomena in degenerate and non-degenerate matter, taking into account the effect of relativistic mechanics. They discuss the effusion of non-degenerate matter and degenerate matter obeying Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein statistics, providing expressions for the number of particles effusing out and the average mass of particles in the effusion stream.
