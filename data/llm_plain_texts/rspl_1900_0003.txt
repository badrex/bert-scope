tldr: The author's experiments with echinoid Strongylocentrotus lividus eggs demonstrate that they are sensitive to environmental conditions during impregnation. The size of the resulting larvae decreases when exposed to abnormal temperatures, with the effect diminishing over time as the larvae develop. This research highlights the importance of environmental factors in the growth and development of organisms.
