tldr: The author discusses the similarities between the development of the anterior part of the Mullerian duct in birds and the changes in the open extremity of the segmental duct in Amphibia, leading to the formation of the head-kidney. They also mention the presence of a peculiar body, the glomerulus, in both Amphibia and birds, and suggest that they may be homologous structures. The author believes that further research and illustrations will provide more evidence for this homology.
