tldr: This article presents an experimental investigation of the electricity produced by the contact and separation of different metals, specifically copper and zinc. The authors constructed a mechanism to test the effect of metallic contact on a Thomson-Becker quadrant electrometer and a Thomson galvanometer. They found that the contact of dissimilar metals produced a small but measurable amount of electricity, which could be detected using sensitive electrometers and galvanometers.
