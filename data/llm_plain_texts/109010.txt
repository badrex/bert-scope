tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the specific heat of mixtures of ethylic alcohol and water. They discovered that the specific heat of these mixtures, up to an alcoholic strength of about 36%, is higher than the specific heat of water. This finding challenges the common belief that water has the highest specific heat of any substance, solid or liquid. The authors used two methods to estimate the specific heat and found that the results were consistent across different experiments.
