tldr: The article investigates the general irreducible representations of the proper Lorentz group, showing that they can be characterized by an ordered pair of complex numbers. It introduces expinors, an extension of symmetric spinors, which can be used to describe the transformation properties of wave functions of spinning particles. The study also discusses the conditions for a representation to be unitary and the connection between spinors and the Lorentz group.
