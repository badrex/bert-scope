tldr: The authors present a covariant symplectic formalism for general relativity, using a solder form and a torsion-free connection as basic variables. They exhibit a naturally defined 2-form on the space of solutions to the field equations, which is closed due to the torsion-free condition and the field equations. This approach eliminates the need for a time function or the distinction between three-dimensional diffeomorphisms and time evolution, making the formalism fully covariant.
