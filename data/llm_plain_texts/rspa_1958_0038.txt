tldr: The authors studied the electronic emission spectra of the carbon disulphide ion (CS) and discovered two band systems. They analyzed the rotational structure of the bands and found that the molecule is likely linear or has a symmetric top configuration. The study provides insights into the molecular structure and electronic states of the carbon disulphide ion.
