tldr: Charles Samuel Hanes was a pioneering biochemist who made significant contributions to the understanding of starch, enzyme kinetics, and macromolecular structures. He discovered plant phosphorylases and proposed a helical conformation for starch molecules. Hanes also developed the Hanes plot, a useful tool in enzyme kinetics, and worked on various committees and research projects throughout his career.
