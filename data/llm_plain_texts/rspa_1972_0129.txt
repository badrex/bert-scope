tldr: This article investigates the ground state of chromium in magnesium oxide using thermal conductivity measurements. The results confirm the existence of resonant scattering by ions at specific energy levels, supporting the dynamic Jahn-Teller theory. The findings also indicate the presence of strong coupled mode effects and provide insights into the nature of the ground state of chromium in an octahedral site.
