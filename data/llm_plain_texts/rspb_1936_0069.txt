tldr: The authors investigate the histological structure and properties of nerve fibers in cephalopods and crustacea, focusing on axons and their sheaths. They find that the sheaths surrounding axons in cephalopods are continuous and consist of connective tissue, while the giant axons in the stellar nerves of cephalopods are syncytia produced by the fusion of the processes of many small cells. The study provides insights into the structure and function of nerve fibers in these organisms.
