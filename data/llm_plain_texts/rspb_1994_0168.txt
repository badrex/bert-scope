tldr: Researchers studied the development and formation of the chiral ultrastructure of coccoliths in the marine alga Emiliania huxleyi. They used electron microscopy to observe the growth stages and found that the earliest stages are characterized by an elliptical proto-coccolith ring of discrete single crystals of calcite. The chiral ultrastructure suggests that the calcite crystals are enclosed within vesicles that are laid down in a chiral arrangement.
