tldr: This study investigates the diffusion of turbulent energy in plane Couette flow using a direct numerical simulation. The results disprove the counter-gradient diffusion hypothesis and reveal that turbulent energy production is nearly balanced by energy dissipation throughout the core region. The findings provide a more plausible explanation for the behavior of turbulent energy in this type of flow.
