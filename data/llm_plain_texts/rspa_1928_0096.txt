tldr: The authors conducted experiments using a unique method to fuse copper wires and create a spark spectrum. They identified new terms in the copper ionized spectrum and tested Shenstone's allocation of terms. The study provides a better understanding of the atomic structure and properties of copper, contributing to the field of atomic physics and chemistry.
