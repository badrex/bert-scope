tldr: This article investigates the effect of density gradient and shear on the flow over a hemisphere. The authors found that a vorticity component appears in the direction of flow when an inviscid fluid with a slight vertical variation of stagnation pressure and density flows over an obstacle. The secondary vorticity produced causes either an upward or downward flow on the surface of the hemisphere, depending on the density gradient and the Richardson number. The results have implications for understanding fluid flow in atmospheric and estuarine environments.
