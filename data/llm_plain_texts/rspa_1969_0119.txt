tldr: The article investigates the behavior of high-temperature gases undergoing inelastic collisions and the effects on their transport properties and shock structure. The study uses a modified Boltzmann equation and suitable inelastic collision cross-sections to analyze a one-dimensional normal shock. The results provide insights into the gas dynamic behavior and help understand the impact of inelastic processes on the evolution of the gas.
