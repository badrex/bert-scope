tldr: 'This study examines how female guppies choose mates and the genetic consequences for their offspring's growth and reproduction. Female guppies prefer larger males, and this preference is heritable. Sons and daughters of larger fathers have higher growth rates, leading to increased reproductive output due to their larger body size. These findings support the "good genes" theory of sexual selection and demonstrate the impact of female mate preferences on offspring life history traits.'
