tldr: The author investigates the rolling up of a semi-infinite vortex sheet and its subsequent evolution. They analyze the shape of the vortex sheet and the inner tightly wound portion of the spiral, finding that the turns of the spiral become slightly elliptical due to the straining effect of distant parts of the vortex sheet. The study provides an inviscid outer solution for the core of the rolling-up vortex sheet and suggests that the results would be useful in a numerical approach.
