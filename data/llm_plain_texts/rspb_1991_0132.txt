tldr: This study investigates the effects of limited mobility on predator-prey dynamics using a model that incorporates individual-based movement and interactions. The results show that limited mobility reduces fluctuations in predator and prey densities, while equilibrium densities and overall population rates remain unaffected. The dynamics of the model are tied to a characteristic spatial scale imposed by individual biology, demonstrating the importance of considering mobility limitations in understanding population dynamics.
