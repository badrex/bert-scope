tldr: The authors discovered a method to trap reactive radicals and atoms in rigid solvents, allowing them to study these unstable molecules for extended periods. They used photolysis to create radicals in a solvent at low temperatures, and then observed their absorption spectra in the frozen glass. This technique can be applied to study the primary products of photochemical or radiation chemical processes.
