tldr: The North Sea Project aimed to improve our understanding of the North Sea system and its management. Through innovative approaches and interdisciplinary modeling, the project made significant progress in advancing oceanographic knowledge and developing more accurate simulations of the seasonal cycle. The project's achievements include a working transport model, new insights into the relation of theory and observation, and the development of interdisciplinary models that integrate physics, chemistry, and biology. These advancements lay the foundation for future studies and better management of the North Sea environment.
