tldr: The study investigates the role of brainstem serotonergic interneurons in the development of a vertebrate spinal locomotor circuit using Xenopus tadpoles as a model. The researchers found that the ingrowth of serotonergic axons plays a critical role in the maturation of locomotor bursts by transforming the output of embryonic amphibian swimming circuitry into a more mature and flexible form. The study also demonstrates that exposure to a monoamine neurotoxin (5,7 dihydroxytryptamine) deletes serotonergic raphespinal projections and prevents the normal maturation of larval swimming.
