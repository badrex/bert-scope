tldr: The author examines the cytological characteristics of tar tumours in mice, focusing on the role of the Golgi apparatus in their growth. They observe that the malignant condition in tar tumours arises in small isolated foci and that the degree of differentiation of epidermal cells varies. The study also highlights the abnormal conditions of epidermal cells, such as hypertrophy and degeneration, and their relation to tumour growth.
