tldr: The authors investigate the stability of viscous flow between two rotating cylinders with an axial pressure gradient. They develop a perturbation theory to determine the critical Taylor number for the onset of instability, considering the Reynolds number of the mean axial flow. The results provide a better understanding of the behavior of fluids in rotating systems.
