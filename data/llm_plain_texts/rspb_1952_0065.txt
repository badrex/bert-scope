tldr: The study investigates the factors affecting colony formation by bacteria in the presence of antibacterial agents. The authors found that factors such as drug concentration, inoculum size, and the interaction between the solid medium and bacteria play a significant role in colony formation. The results suggest that the production of resistant colonies is not solely due to the presence of specific mutants and that other factors, such as diffusible substances and the colloidal properties of the medium, can influence colony formation.
