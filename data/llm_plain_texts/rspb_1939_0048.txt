tldr: The author investigates the effect of subnormal temperature on the differentiation and survival of in vitro embryonic and infantile rat and mouse ovaries. They found that incubating explants at a lower temperature improved the health and longevity of the cultures. The study suggests that lowering the temperature may reduce the metabolic rate, allowing cells to survive better in tissue cultures with imperfect nutrient exchange.
