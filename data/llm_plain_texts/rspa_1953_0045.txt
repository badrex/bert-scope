tldr: This article extends the theories of conductivity and viscosity of electrolyte solutions by considering ions as having a non-zero radius. The author compares the new theory with experimental data and discusses its implications for understanding the behavior of electrolyte solutions. The study focuses on symmetrical electrolytes and assumes complete dissociation of the salt, treating ions as rigid, uniformly charged, unpolarizable spheres.
