tldr: This study examines the complex oscillations and wave behavior that can occur when a sluice-gate is lowered just to touch the surface of a stream in an open water channel. The experiments conducted in two channels reveal that the Froude number, calculated from the mean discharge and the gate opening, is crucial for the occurrence of these oscillations. The existence of a jump or cnoidal wave downstream is essential for the observed phenomena. The findings provide valuable insights into the unstable flow dynamics under sluice-gates and contribute to the understanding of fluid mechanics and hydraulic engineering.
