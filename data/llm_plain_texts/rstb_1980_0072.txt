tldr: Researchers discovered that fat and non-fatty tissue in human breast samples have different T1 relaxation ratios. This finding allows for the possibility of locating tumors using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging, as tumors have a lower fat content than their surroundings. The team scanned samples with a resolution of about 0.4 mm x 0.4 mm and found that NMR images of breast tissue provided good contrast between fat and non-fatty tissue, making tumors visible.
