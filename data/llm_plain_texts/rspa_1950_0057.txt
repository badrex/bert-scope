tldr: The authors study the equations of motion for a one-dimensional dislocation model and find solutions representing disturbances propagated without change of form. They discover three types of solutions: dislocations with velocities less than the characteristic wave velocity, anti-dislocations with velocities greater than the characteristic wave velocity, and waves of infinitesimal amplitude. The study provides insights into the behavior of dislocations in three-dimensional crystals and helps in understanding the dynamics of materials.
