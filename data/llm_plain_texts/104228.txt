tldr: The author describes his observations of chalky tubulous concretions called Malm and the farina of the red lily through a microscope. He suggests that Malm may be formed by the accumulation of chalky particles around wood debris in a valley. The author also discusses his microscopical discoveries of the farina of the red lily, observing the ejection of small globules from the farinaceous bodies.
