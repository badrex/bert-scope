tldr: 'A letter from W. Barnard describes a coal-pit explosion in Middleton, Yorkshire, caused by miners drilling holes and filling them with gunpowder. The explosion was so powerful that it shook the surrounding area, damaged the works at the mouth of the pit, and created a vacuum in the air. The author also notes that the trees in the area bent towards the pit, indicating the force of the explosion.'
