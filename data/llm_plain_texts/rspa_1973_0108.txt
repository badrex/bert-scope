tldr: The authors construct a dynamical group for the isotropic three-dimensional harmonic oscillator using the semi-direct product of the Weyl group and the real symplectic group Sp. This group simplifies the calculation of matrix elements of operators acting on harmonic oscillator states and has a rich subgroup structure. The authors also discuss the properties of the degeneracy group, the rotational invariance group, and the transition group within the harmonic oscillator system.
