tldr: The authors extended the method of using the heterogeneous removal of atomic hydrogen on molybdenum oxide to investigate the reactivity of various substituted ethylenes and benzenes. They made corrections for the fraction of atomic hydrogen that combines on the silica window of the reaction vessel and obtained new results for substituted olefines and aromatic hydrocarbons.
