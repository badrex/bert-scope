tldr: This article explores the asymptotic expansion of integral functions defined by Taylor series. The author deduces asymptotic expansions from the properties of the coefficients and studies several classes of functions. The results provide information about the distribution of zeroes and other values of the functions, contributing to the understanding of the behavior of integral functions for large values of the variable.
