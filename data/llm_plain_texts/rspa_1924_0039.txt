tldr: This article discusses the drying process of various materials, such as wool, sand, and soil, and examines the rate of evaporation at different moisture contents. The author argues that the drying process is not continuous but rather consists of several discontinuous steps, with changes in rate occurring at various intervals. The author also addresses criticisms from other researchers and provides additional data to support their findings.
