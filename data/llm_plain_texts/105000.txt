tldr: In a letter to the Rev. Samuel Squire, Rev. Thomas Rutherforth describes the extraordinary agitation of waters in several ponds in Hertfordshire. He recounts the unusual motion observed in ponds at Patmerhall, Wickham-hall, Thaxted, and Royston, with details on the direction and extent of the water movement. This phenomenon remained unexplained at the time of the letter.
