tldr: This study investigates the effects of hyaluronidase on the development of cartilage and bone in chicken embryos. The results show that hyaluronidase treatment leads to increased synthesis of macromolecules and altered growth and morphology of bone and cartilage. The cells can re-establish their normal environment after the initial loss of intercellular macromolecules, demonstrating the ability to recover and adapt to changes in the extracellular environment.
