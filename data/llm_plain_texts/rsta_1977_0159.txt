tldr: This article discusses the dissipation of tidal energy in the oceans and its consequences on the lunar orbit and Earth's rotation. The most precise method to estimate tidal dissipation is by evaluating the rate at which work is done on the ocean surface. The results from astronomical, satellite, and tidal estimates of dissipation allow for a separation of energy sinks in the solid Earth, the Moon, and the oceans. The study of tidal dissipation is important for understanding the origin and evolution of the Moon and other planetary satellite systems.
