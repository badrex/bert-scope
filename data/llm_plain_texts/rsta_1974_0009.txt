tldr: This article explores the role of astronomy in ancient Egypt, focusing on their calendar systems and star clocks. The early Egyptians used a lunar calendar and later transitioned to a 365-day civil calendar, which they divided into three seasons of four 30-day months. Star clocks, or "diagonal calendars," were used to measure time at night, with 12-hour cycles represented by specific constellations. These innovations in time measurement had a significant impact on Egyptian society and laid the foundation for modern calendars.
