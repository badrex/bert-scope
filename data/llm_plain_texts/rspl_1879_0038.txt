tldr: The author investigates the physical properties and compressibility of liquid acetylene, a hydrocarbon with significant interest for chemists. They determine the critical point, vapor tension at various temperatures, densities, and coefficients of compressibility. Acetylene is found to have a lower density than liquid carbonic acid and is only about half as expansible as carbonic acid. The study shows that acetylene is governed by the same laws as other compressible liquids, with its compressibility increasing as the temperature rises but decreasing as the pressure increases.
