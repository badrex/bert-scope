tldr: The authors, Warren De La Rue, Balfour Stewart, and Benjamin Loewy, conducted observations on sunspots at the Kew Observatory. They reviewed the two existing theories on the nature of sunspots and presented their belief that sunspots are cavities at a lower level than the sun's photosphere. They provided evidence from their observations and invited other observers to focus on similar phenomena.
