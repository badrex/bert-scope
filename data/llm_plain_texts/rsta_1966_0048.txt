tldr: This article discusses the damage caused to solids by cavitation, a phenomenon that occurs when a fluid flows through a constriction and vapor bubbles collapse. The author presents findings from experiments using cavitating venturi tunnels and a vibratory facility, observing different types of damage, such as single-event pitting and fatigue-type failures. The author also highlights the sensitivity of cavitation damage to minor system variations, such as fluid purity, venturi roughness, and specimen orientation.
