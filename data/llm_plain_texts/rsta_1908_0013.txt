tldr: This article investigates the effects of impurities and electrolyte conditions on the accuracy of the silver voltameter, a device used to measure electric quantity. The authors find that impurities in silver nitrate solutions can significantly affect the mass of silver deposited per ampere-second, and they provide recommendations for preparing and handling the electrolyte to obtain more accurate results.
