tldr: The gaseous oxidation of trimethylamine was studied, revealing that the reaction has no auto-catalytic character and becomes inhibited as products accumulate. The main products are formaldehyde and dimethylamine, with smaller amounts of nitrogen and carbon monoxide. The oxidation rate is reduced by increased surface area and the addition of dimethylamine, while nitrogen peroxide and formaldehyde have a small retarding influence on the reaction.
