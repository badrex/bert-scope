tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the refractive indices and dispersion of several gaseous compounds, including silicon tetrachloride, silicon tetrabromide, boron trichloride, and boron tribromide. They used a Jamin interferometer and a mercury vapor lamp to determine the refractive index for each substance in the gaseous state. The results provide a criterion for evaluating existing theories of paramagnetism and agree with Stoner's view on spin and orbital moments.
