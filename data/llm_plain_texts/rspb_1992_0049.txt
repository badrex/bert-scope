tldr: 'This study examines the genetic consequences of introducing guppies (Poecilia reticulata) in N. Trinidad. The introduced population has significantly impacted the native guppy population, with genetic evidence suggesting a founder event and genetic drift. The introduced guppies have spread downstream, replacing the native guppy population in a substantial stretch of the river. This research highlights the importance of understanding the genetic impact of species introductions on local populations and ecosystems.'
