revised_title: 'Critique of the Two-Fluid Model of Helium Film'
semantic_tags:
  - Superfluidity
  - Helium film
  - Thermodynamics
  - Third sound
  - Attenuation
tldr: The author critiques the thermodynamic approach used by Goodstein and Saffman in their theory of thin superfluid helium films, arguing that their theory does not explain Keller's experiment and their calculation of third sound attenuation is incomplete. The author also claims that the new results obtained by Goodstein and Saffman are unfounded and incorrect.
