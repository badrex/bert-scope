tldr: The article examines the role of second-order resonance in the nonlinear stability of subcritical flows, specifically focusing on shear flows. The author derives nonlinear stability criteria that can improve upon the single-mode criterion of Stuart and others. The study also explores the evolution of resonant triads of wave modes and their impact on the stability of subcritical flows.
