tldr: The author, G. Gore, conducted experiments to study the relationship between transfer-resistance, molecular weight, and chemical composition of electrolytes. He discovered that transfer-resistance appears to be a new physical relation of atomic weights and varies inversely with the atomic weights of electropositive and electronegative elements in the electrolyte. The research also suggests that corrosion may be a consequence of small transfer-resistance and is related to surface tension.
