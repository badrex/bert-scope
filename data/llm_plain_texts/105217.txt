tldr: Sir James Gray reports on the discoveries made at Herculaneum, including valuable ancient artifacts and manuscripts. Among the finds are rolls of papyri with Greek text, some still containing their umbilici. The manuscripts discuss topics such as music, poetry, and Epicurean philosophy. A bust of Epicurus and other philosopher heads were also found, suggesting they were part of a library collection. The King of Naples is committed to preserving these valuable remains and plans to publish a catalog of the discoveries.
