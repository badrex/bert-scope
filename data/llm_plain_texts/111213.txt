tldr: In 1850, Captain Henry Mangles Denham reported a deep-sea sounding expedition that reached 7706 fathoms, or nearly 7.7 geographical miles, in 36°49' South Latitude and 37°6' West Longitude. The sounding was conducted during the passage of H.M. ship Herald from Rio de Janeiro to the Cape of Good Hope. The sea bottom had depths exceeding the elevation of the highest mountains, such as the Himalayas. Unfortunately, the attempt to bring the plummet back to the surface failed when the line broke at 140 fathoms below the waterline.
