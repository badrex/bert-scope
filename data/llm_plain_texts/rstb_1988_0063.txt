tldr: This article discusses the rare-male effect, a phenomenon where male mating success varies with the frequency of their morph in the male population. The author examines the potential mechanisms behind the rare-male effect, including frequency-dependent mate choice by females and its possible evolutionary significance. The author also highlights the problems with data, experimental design, and analysis in studies of the rare-male effect.
