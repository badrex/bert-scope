revised_title: 'Investigating the Mechanisms of Edge-Tones in Fluid Jets'

tldr: The authors study the mechanics of edge-tones produced when a fluid jet issues through a slit and interacts with an edge placed parallel to the slit. They analyze the frequency spectrum of the sound field and propose a modified 'double-vortex avenue' theory to explain the jumps in frequency and the relationship between the wavelength and the distance from the edge to the slit.
