tldr: The authors present a simple model for oscillatory chemical reactions in closed vessels, focusing on a cubic autocatalator. They investigate the behavior of the model under the pool chemical approximation and analyze the influence of adding or changing the chemical steps. The study reveals the range of validity of the approximation and provides insights into the oscillatory behavior of chemical reactions in closed systems.
