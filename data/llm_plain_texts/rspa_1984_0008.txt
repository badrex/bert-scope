tldr: The author presents a method to simplify the algebraic representation of fourth-rank tensors, which are used to describe the properties of crystalline anisotropic materials. By partitioning these tensors into sets based on crystal classes, the author demonstrates how to create closed linear associative algebras for calculating tensor products and inverses. This approach allows for easier analysis of the material properties and better understanding of their underlying structure.
