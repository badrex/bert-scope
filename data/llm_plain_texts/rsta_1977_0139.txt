tldr: The authors present a null field approach to scalar diffraction, a method that can be used to solve scattering problems involving arbitrary bodies and cylindrical bodies. They discuss the advantages of using elliptic cylinder coordinates or spheroidal coordinates to reduce numerical instability and provide a detailed explanation of the null field equations for sound-soft and sound-hard bodies.
