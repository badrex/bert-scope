semantic_tags:
  - Group Theory
  - Quantum Mechanics
  - Tensor Operators
  - Coupling Coefficients
  - Symmetry in Physics
tldr: This article explores the action of an arbitrary group on an arbitrary Hilbert space, focusing on coupling coefficients and tensor operators for chains of groups. The study covers properties of coupling coefficients, the Wigner-Eckart theorem, and the Racah factorization lemma. The article aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of these concepts and their applications in various fields of physics, including atomic, nuclear, and crystal theory.
