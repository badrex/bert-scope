tldr: The author presents theoretical solutions for the time-dependent electric current in a flame ionization detector, focusing on the influence of ionic diffusion. The solutions are expressed in terms of 'flame polynomials' and are analyzed in one, two, and three dimensions. The study provides insights into the behavior of ions in flames and contributes to the understanding of flame ionization detectors.
