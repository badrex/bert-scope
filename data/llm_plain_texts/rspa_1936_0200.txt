tldr: The authors conducted a critical experimental investigation of the "force" method to determine the dielectric capacity of conducting liquids at low frequencies, focusing on univalent electrolytes in aqueous solutions. They found that the method could provide precise results for various liquids, including solutions of proteins, which had been challenging to measure due to their surface orientation. The study aimed to establish accurate dielectric constant values and improve understanding of the dielectric properties of conducting solutions.
