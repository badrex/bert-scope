tldr: The authors measured the magnetic contributions to the specific heats of various paramagnetic salts and their diluted specimens. They found that the specific heats can be analyzed into contributions from isolated paramagnetic ions and interactions between the magnetic ions. Exchange interaction, particularly the anisotropic type, plays a significant role in these salts, even in magnetically dilute cases. This study helps to understand the behavior of paramagnetic salts and their potential applications in adiabatic demagnetization work.
