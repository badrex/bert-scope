tldr: The authors studied the photolysis of pure, dry ozone by ultraviolet radiation and found that the quantum yield for the photolysis of pure ozone was proportional to the pressure of ozone. They proposed a reaction mechanism involving energy-rich oxygen molecules and discussed the role of water vapor and inert gases in the process. The results provide insights into the photochemical reactions and atmospheric chemistry of ozone.
