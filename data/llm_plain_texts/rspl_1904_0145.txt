tldr: This article presents experiments conducted by Bertram Hopkinson on the effects of momentary stresses in metals, specifically iron and copper wires. Using a wave-meter, Hopkinson measured the momentary extension of the wires and compared it to the theoretical calculations. The results showed that both iron and copper wires can be stressed beyond their static elastic limit and breaking loads without losing proportionality of stresses and strains, provided the stress is applied for a short time, around 1/1000 second.
