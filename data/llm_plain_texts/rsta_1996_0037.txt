tldr: The authors study the stability of Riemann ellipsoids, a family of models for rotating, self-gravitating masses, focusing on short-wavelength perturbations. They use the geometrical-optics approximation to analyze the stability of these configurations and find that most of the parameter space corresponds to unstable configurations. The exceptions are the rigidly rotating configurations of Maclaurin and Jacobi, and a narrow band of irrotational ellipsoids, including the non-rotating sphere.
