tldr: The article discusses the use of the model plant species Arabidopsis to study genes that promote or delay flowering. It explains how environmental factors, such as temperature and day length, influence flowering time and how genetic approaches have been used to identify genes and their products involved in this process. The article also highlights the importance of understanding the regulation of flowering time for optimizing plant growth and seed production.
