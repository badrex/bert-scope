tldr: In February 1731, John Dove observed a comet while sailing near the South Atlantic. He reported the sighting to astronomer Edmund Halley, providing details about the comet's appearance and path. Dove also mentioned the ship's variation in azimuth and shared his celestial navigation observations. This letter contributes to the historical record of early astronomical discoveries and the understanding of comets during the 18th century.
