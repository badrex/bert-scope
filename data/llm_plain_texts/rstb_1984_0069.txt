tldr: This study presents a computer model for simulating the movement of water and H ions through a forested watershed. The model is sensitive to changes in field capacity, hydraulic conductivity, soil depth, and acid neutralizing capacity. The research focuses on defining the more sensitive processes for further study and improving the understanding of watershed response in non-calcareous environments.
