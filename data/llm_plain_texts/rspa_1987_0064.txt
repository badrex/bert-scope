tldr: The article examines the sound field generated by membrane surface waves on a wedge-shaped boundary. It presents a solution for a semi-infinite membrane attached to a hard surface and irradiated by incoming non-attenuating membrane waves. The study uses the Kontorovich-Lebedev transform to obtain the solution and highlights the complex interactions between the acoustic field and the embedded structure.
