tldr: This article presents an experimental study of X-ray reflexion and scattering with a change of frequency, focusing on the quantum theory of X-ray reflexion and scattering in crystals. The author, Sir C. V. Raman, discusses the experimental results and their relation to the theoretical aspects of the subject, explaining the geometric reflexion and scattering phenomena observed in diamond and other crystals. The findings contribute to the understanding of the interaction between X-rays and crystal lattices, with implications for crystallography and physics.
