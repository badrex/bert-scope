tldr: The authors investigated the mechanism of cold electron emission from surfaces covered with tarnish films and the influence of surface roughness and electrode material on emission. They found that substantial electron emission can be produced by comparatively low applied electric fields and that the presence of positive ions on the tarnish film is essential to the emission mechanism. The results have applications in the initiation of electrical discharges, including electrical breakdown mechanisms at high pressures and the initiation of micro-arcs at electrical contacts.
