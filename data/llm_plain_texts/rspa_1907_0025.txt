tldr: This article investigates the effect of high temperatures on radium emanation and its products. The authors found that the rate of decay of the emanation remains the same even at high temperatures. The change in activity observed when heated must be due to an alteration in one of the more rapidly decaying products. The authors also developed a new method to measure the change in activity caused by heating the active deposits.
