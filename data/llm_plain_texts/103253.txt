tldr: The author, Anthony van Leeuwenhoek, observed and described the circulation of blood in fishes and eels. He discovered that the blood is carried through a series of vessels and valves, which help regulate the flow of blood. His observations led him to believe that a similar system exists in human beings, with valves controlling the flow of blood in the arteries and veins.
