tldr: 'In a letter to Capt. Samuel Mead, Capt. William Gordon describes his observations of a fire-ball seen on December 11, 1741. The fire-ball appeared over London and was visible for over five minutes. It expanded, changed forms, and moved quickly through the sky before disappearing, leaving a smoky substance in its path. Gordon's account provides a detailed description of the fire-ball and its behavior, which was observed by several people in London and the surrounding areas.'
