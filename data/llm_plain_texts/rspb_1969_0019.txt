tldr: This study examines the structure and function of the caecum in articulate brachiopods. The researchers found that the caecum is a complex structure that plays a significant role in the storage of protein and polysaccharides. The caecum originates in the outer lobe of the mantle and penetrates the shell, connecting with the periostracum through a brush. The researchers also discovered that the core cells in the caecum store various chemical components, which are essential for the functioning of the brachiopod's mantle.
