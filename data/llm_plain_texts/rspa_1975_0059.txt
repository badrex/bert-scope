tldr: This article discusses the accuracy and validity of electron density measurements taken from the Prospero and Ariel 4 satellites. The authors analyze the effects of satellite spin modulation, such as wake effects, geomagnetic field effects, and A effects, on the measurements. They also compare the results with other independent techniques, such as incoherent backscatter measurements and cosmic radio noise measurements, and find that the overall agreement is within experimental errors. The study focuses on the equatorial anomaly, mid-latitude trough, and auroral peak in the ionosphere.
