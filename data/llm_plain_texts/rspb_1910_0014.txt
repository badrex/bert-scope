tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the formation and healing of gastric ulcers in cats using immunized goat serum. They discovered that the serum caused toxic changes in the stomach's mucous membrane, which was then digested by gastric juice. The healing process began within three to five days and was completed in most cases by the 21st day. The study provides insights into the factors affecting ulcer formation and healing, such as the stomach's resting or digesting state and the role of diet.
