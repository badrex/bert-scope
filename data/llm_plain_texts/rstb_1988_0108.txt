tldr: The article discusses the transmission dynamics of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and its impact on various populations. It reviews data on infections and AIDS cases among different groups, such as homosexual men, heterosexuals, intravenous drug abusers, and children born to infected mothers. The authors develop mathematical models to understand the transmission processes and explore the potential effects of AIDS on population growth, age profiles, and social and economic indicators in affected countries. The study emphasizes the need for more data and research to better understand and control the spread of HIV.
