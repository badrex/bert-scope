tldr: The author develops a theory of basic commutators for polynilpotent related subgroups of a free group, extending the conventional theory of lower central series. This theory investigates the properties of shape subgroups and provides a basis for studying free polynilpotent groups. The author also applies the theory to Lie rings and demonstrates that the corresponding factor groups are residually nilpotent.
