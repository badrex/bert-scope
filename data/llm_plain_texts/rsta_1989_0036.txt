tldr: This article discusses the advantages of conducting research on the coupled ionosphere-magnetosphere system in Antarctica. It highlights the unique features of the Antarctic region, such as the wide separation of the geographic and geomagnetic poles, which lead to hemispheric asymmetries and longitudinal structure in the high-latitude ionosphere and magnetosphere. The article also presents various examples of research conducted in Antarctica and the experimental methods used to overcome logistical difficulties.
