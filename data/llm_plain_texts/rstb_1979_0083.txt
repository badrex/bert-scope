tldr: This study analyzes the distribution, variation, and origins of pre-Devensian tills in eastern England using mechanical and mineralogical analysis. The research divides the tills into two groups: the North Sea Drift group and the Lowestoft Till group. The study uses automated contouring, spatial analysis, and trend surface analysis to understand the distribution of till properties and the movements of glacial ice in the region. The findings suggest that the most vigorous ice stream entered eastern England at the Wash, while weaker ice streams carried chalky North Sea material directly onto the Chalk of Lincolnshire and north Norfolk.
