tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the mechanism of metallic wear, specifically plastic ratchetting. They discovered that this process occurs when stress concentrations at the edges of a hard slider cause the softer surface to accumulate plastic deformation. This mechanism can happen under frictionless conditions and is responsible for the formation of thin wear particles in sliding contact.
