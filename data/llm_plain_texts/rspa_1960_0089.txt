tldr: The authors studied the electrical properties of graphite-bromine crystal compounds. They found that the formation of these compounds leads to a significant decrease in electrical resistance in both principal directions. The research supports the theory that bromine abstracts electrons from the full-band of graphite, creating positive holes. The authors also determined the number of electrons transferred from the -band to the atoms of the adduct, providing insights into the nature of the bonding between bromine and graphite.
