tldr: The author, William Henry Barlow, conducted experiments on beams to determine the position of the neutral axis and discovered a third element of strength in beams subjected to transverse strain. This element, called "Resistance of Flexure," is due to the lateral action of fibers or particles on each other. The experiments showed that the neutral axis is in the center of the beam, and the outer portions of the beam do not extend proportionally to the applied force due to this lateral action.
