tldr: The authors analyze the relationship between the chemical structure of non-electrolytes and their ability to permeate cell membranes. They find that stronger solute-water forces and weaker solute-membrane forces are associated with lower permeating power. Most substituents that form intermolecular hydrogen bonds with water decrease permeation, while intramolecular hydrogen bonding accelerates it. Inductive effects, such as halogens and the nitro group, also impact permeability. The main factor in the increase of permeability with increasing hydrocarbon chain length is an entropy effect associated with a change in local water structure.
