tldr: This article explores the dynamics of nonlinear, dissipative systems in open chemical systems, focusing on the simplest open system (CSTR) and how far the isothermal scheme goes in explaining the existence of alternative oscillatory patterns in the oxygen-hydrogen reaction. The authors discuss the importance of simple, easily mathematically and chemically self-consistent models in understanding the variety of behavior that can arise from simple overall chemical properties.
