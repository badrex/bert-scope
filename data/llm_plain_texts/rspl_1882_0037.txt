tldr: This article investigates the relationship between sunspots and terrestrial phenomena, specifically the variations of the daily range of magnetic declination. The author analyzes data from the Colaba Observatory in Bombay and finds that the winter lunar variation of magnetic declination is affected by the presence of sunspots. The study also reveals that the sunspot period is followed by changes in magnetic declination, with notable maxima and minima occurring in 1859-60, 1856, and 1866-67.
