tldr: This article presents a generalized aerofoil theory that extends the classical theory to deal with porous aerofoils, finite bubbles on aerofoils, and aerofoils with high-speed air ejection. The theory is based on a new treatment of the tangent gas and provides a unified account of the calculation of steady inviscid flow at subsonic speeds around a two-dimensional aerofoil.
