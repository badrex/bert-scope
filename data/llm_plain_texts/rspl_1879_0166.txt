tldr: The author discusses the atomic weight of aluminium and the effect of gaseous occlusion on the results. They found that aluminium can contain occluded gas, almost pure hydrogen, which affects the atomic weight determination. The author concludes that the influence of gaseous occlusion is inappreciable by existing means of measurement in this case.
