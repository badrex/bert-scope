tldr: The author investigates the transplantation immunity of mammalian mothers and their offspring in four species, demonstrating delayed rejection between mothers and offspring during and after pregnancy. This phenomenon, called "immunological inertia of viviparity," is believed to be a type of specific adaptive immunity, but its causative mechanisms remain unknown.
