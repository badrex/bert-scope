tldr: This article presents a formula for calculating the refractive index of quartz for the extraordinary ray. The authors used previous work on optical rotatory power and recent measurements of wave-lengths to derive the equation. They also provide a table comparing calculated and observed refractive indices for 18 lines in the visible and ultra-violet spectrum.
