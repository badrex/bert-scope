tldr: The authors determined acidity constants in the triplet state for seven aromatic molecules using two independent methods. They found that acidity constants of the triplet and ground states are comparable, while the first excited singlet state differs by a factor of about 10. This information provides insights into the electron density distribution in different states and helps understand the differences in reactivity between molecules in their ground and excited states.
