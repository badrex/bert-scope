tldr: This article investigates the relationship between the intensity and frequency of alternating currents in nerve excitation. The author compares calculated values from the intensity-frequency relation with observations using exponentially increasing currents. The study provides insights into the phase at which the alternating current is made and its effect on nerve excitation. The findings contribute to understanding the behavior of excitable tissues and the potential applications in medicine and health sciences.
