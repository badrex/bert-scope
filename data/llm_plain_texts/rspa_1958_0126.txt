revised_title: Radiation-Induced Decomposition and Birefringent Bands in Potassium and Sodium Azide Crystals

tldr: The authors studied the radiation-induced decomposition of potassium and sodium azide crystals, observing brightly colored birefringent bands when the crystals were viewed under polarized light. They found that these bands were due to lamellar twinning and could be used to predict areas of decomposition when the crystals were exposed to radiation.
