tldr: The authors studied the assembly of alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV) protein and its states of aggregation. They found that the main association product is a spherical particle with a sedimentation coefficient of about 30S. The clustering pattern of the protein in the cylindrical part of the AMV capsid supports the concept of dimers as the active assembling units. The research provides insights into the morphogenesis of this virus at the molecular level.
