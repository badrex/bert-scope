tldr: The authors analyze the tangency condition for ductile tearing instability in the R6 failure assessment procedure. They find that the tangency condition specified in R6 does not give predictions in accord with -curve analysis, but it provides a more conservative estimate of the critical load for instability when a conservative choice of the failure assessment line is made. This work sheds light on the structure of R6 and suggests that it may be conservative relative to -curve analysis.
