tldr: The author describes a water-raising machine used in Oulton, Cheshire, in 1772. The machine utilized the momentum of water to force air out of a valve box, which then condensed and pushed water into a reservoir. Despite its initial success, the air vessel burst after a few months due to the immense force exerted. This discovery highlights the power of momentum in water systems and the potential for further improvements in hydraulic engineering.
