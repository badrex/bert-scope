tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the radiation of heat from the moon using a three-foot reflector at Parsonstown. They found that the moon's heat radiation varies significantly from night to night and is affected by the transparency of our atmosphere. The author also observed that the heating power of the moon's rays diminishes with altitude, but at a slower rate than the intensity of solar rays. These findings suggest that our atmosphere may be opaque to heat rays of low refrangibility.
