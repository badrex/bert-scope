tldr: The authors used X-ray crystallography to determine the crystal structure of para-dinitrobenzene, a benzene derivative. They found that the molecule has a planar structure with alternating single and double carbon-carbon bonds and a nitro group on each of the para positions. This study contributed to the understanding of molecular structures and the use of X-ray crystallography as a powerful tool in chemistry.
