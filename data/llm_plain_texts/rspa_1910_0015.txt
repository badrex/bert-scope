tldr: The authors conducted a redetermination of the atomic weight of strontium using a rapid and effective method of separating solutions above a precipitate. They purified all materials and used different ratios to establish the atomic weight of strontium. The study aimed to conform to the standard of precision prescribed by modern procedure in atomic weight estimations.
