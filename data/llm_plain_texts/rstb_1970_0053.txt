tldr: This article discusses in vitro studies on the differentiation of the reproductive tract, focusing on the role of hormones in gonadal development and sex differentiation. The authors found that testicular hormones play a crucial role in maintaining Wolffian ducts, while Mullerian ducts remain independent of ovarian hormones. These findings highlight the importance of hormonal regulation in the development of the reproductive system.
