tldr: The article discusses the extent, consistency, and timing of vertical movements in Proterozoic structural provinces, focusing on cratonic and mobile segments of the continental crust. It examines the distribution of unconformities, cover-successions, metamorphism, igneous activity, and isotopic systems in this context. The study reveals that many ancient cratonic masses experienced only small vertical movements over periods up to 2000 million years long, and that erosion of the basement in cratonic regions was concentrated in periods of a few hundred million years. The article also explores the history of uplift in certain Proterozoic mobile provinces and its relation to the problem of the origin of these provinces.
