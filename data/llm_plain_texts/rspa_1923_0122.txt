tldr: This article investigates the distribution of intensities in the helium spectrum as a function of the energy of electron impacts on atoms. The authors studied the effect of various factors, such as pressure and current density, on the radiating process. They used an experimental method involving electrons from an incandescent filament impacting helium atoms with a specific energy, and then analyzed the resulting spectrum. The findings provide insights into the behavior of atoms and their radiating processes under different conditions.
