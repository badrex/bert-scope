tldr: This article discusses the potential of novel ethanol fermentations from sugar cane and straw, focusing on high-temperature fermentation and the utilization of lignocellulosic waste. The author highlights the benefits of using sugar cane as a feedstock for ethanol production due to its high biomass yield and the potential for whole-crop utilization. The article also explores the challenges and opportunities of using lignocellulosic waste, such as wheat straw and sugar cane bagasse, for ethanol production. The author suggests that efficient use of by-products and integrated processes are essential for the economics of ethanol production from these feedstocks.
