tldr: The authors study the steady plane flow of an incompressible, inviscid fluid falling under gravity from a horizontal slot. They develop a nonlinear integral equation for the free streamline and provide a constructive proof of its existence. The method is then applied to related problems, offering insights into the behavior of the fluid jet and the effect of a rigid upper lid on the flow.
