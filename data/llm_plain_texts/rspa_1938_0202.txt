tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the dissociation constant of ammonia in water. They used a cell with a hydrogen electrode and measured the e.m.f. to calculate the hydrogen-ion concentrations of buffer solutions of ammonia and ammonium chloride. The results showed that the dissociation constant of ammonia is approximately 4.75 at 25Â°C, and the temperature coefficients of the equilibrium constants were analyzed.
