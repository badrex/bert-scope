tldr: In 1749, Jo. Freeman experienced and documented a shock similar to an earthquake in London. People were terrified, and various theories were proposed about the cause, such as explosions from nearby houses or powder mills. Freeman's account helped to determine that it was likely an earthquake, which was a significant event in London's history.
