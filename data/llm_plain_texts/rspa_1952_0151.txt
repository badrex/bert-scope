tldr: The author examines the crystal growth of paraffin n-heetane using an electron microscope and discovers two different growth mechanisms. The first is the spiral growth mechanism, similar to that observed in n-hexatriacontane, while the second involves the use of an indestructible step to promote growth along a twin boundary. These findings contribute to the understanding of crystal growth mechanisms and the role of dislocations in the process.
