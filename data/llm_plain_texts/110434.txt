tldr: The author, Charles Lyell, examines evidence of a gradual rising of land in certain parts of Sweden. He investigates various locations, including Calmar, Stockholm, and Upsala, and finds geological and biological evidence of a change in the relative level of the sea and land. He concludes that the land has risen, and the rate of elevation varies in different places, with the highest rate being about three feet in a century.
