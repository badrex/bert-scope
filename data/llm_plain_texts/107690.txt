tldr: This article describes the detailed observations and microscopical drawings of the changes an egg undergoes during incubation in the common fowl. The author, Everard Home, traces the formation of the egg from the time the yolk leaves the ovarium until it becomes a fully formed chicken. The article provides a step-by-step account of the development process, including the formation of the embryo, the growth of organs, and the development of the chick's external features.
