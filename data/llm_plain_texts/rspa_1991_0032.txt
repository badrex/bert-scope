tldr: This study investigates the secondary reaction zone of fuel-rich methane flames and examines the influence of hydrocarbon species on the reactions and concentrations of the OH and O radicals. The results show that the presence of hydrocarbons in the secondary reaction zone affects the reactions and concentrations of these radicals, which are critical in determining the properties of all flames.
