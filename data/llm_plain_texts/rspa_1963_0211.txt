tldr: The authors discuss the sedimentation of a reversibly aggregating substance in solution, taking into account concentration-dependent sedimentation coefficients and the effect of non-aggregating impurities. They present a theoretical model and compare it with experimental results for -lactoglobulin, demonstrating the importance of considering concentration dependence and diffusion in understanding protein aggregation and sedimentation.
