tldr: The authors observed delayed fluorescence in solutions of anthracene and phenanthrene and found that the intensity of delayed fluorescence was proportional to the square of the rate of absorption of exciting light. They proposed a mechanism involving triplet-triplet quenching, which could apply to other photochemical systems and may have implications for the mechanism of photosynthesis. The results suggest that the excited states responsible for delayed fluorescence and normal fluorescence are not of the same type.
