tldr: This study investigates the effect of GABA on lumbar terminations of rubrospinal neurons in the cat spinal cord. The results show that GABA does not have a significant effect on the electrical threshold of rubrospinal terminations, suggesting that these neurons do not have GABA receptors similar to those on cell bodies. The findings contribute to the understanding of GABA's role in the central nervous system and its effects on different types of neurons.
