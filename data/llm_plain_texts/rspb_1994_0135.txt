tldr: The authors study three classic host-parasitoid models and find that chaos in these models occurs via quasiperiodicity, a route not commonly associated with population models. They also discover that chaos can persist in these models even in the presence of small levels of immigration, suggesting that chaos could exist in some natural populations despite external perturbations.
