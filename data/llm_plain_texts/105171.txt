tldr: The author conducted experiments on the electricity of the air at the Chateau de Maintenon and observed its behavior during different weather conditions. They discovered that the strength of the electricity in the air is related to weather conditions and that common electricity has a slow motion. The author also found that exposure to high levels of electrical charge during a storm can have negative effects on human health, as demonstrated by an epileptic man who was affected by the electrical discharge.
