tldr: The authors studied the electrofluorescence of dye-tagged polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) latexes, discovering that both lozenge and rod-shaped particles exhibit significant electro-fluorescent effects. These findings indicate that PTFE particles could be used as a potential medium for display devices, opening up possibilities for organic-based optoelectronic devices.
