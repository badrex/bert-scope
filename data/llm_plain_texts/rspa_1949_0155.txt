tldr: The authors studied the vibration-rotation bands of polyatomic molecules, such as vinyl chloride, vinylidene fluoride, and glyoxal, using high-dispersion recording grating spectrometry. They analyzed the rotational fine structure and moments of inertia, and provided insights into molecular geometry and vibrational assignments. Their findings help to understand the behavior of these molecules and improve the accuracy of spectroscopic measurements.
