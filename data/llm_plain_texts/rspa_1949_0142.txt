tldr: The authors calculate the cross-section of producing mesons in collisions between electrons and atomic nuclei, assuming electrons interact with nucleons through the electromagnetic field. They find that for electrons of energy 300, the cross-section is roughly proportional to the mass number of the target nucleus, ranging from 0.1 to 1 cm^2 per nucleon for different nuclei. The energy spectrum of emitted mesons is also determined.
