tldr: The absorption of a powerful radio wave vertically incident on the lower ionosphere is studied, focusing on the effects of the two magnetoionic components with roughly equal amplitudes. The absorption can be either greater or less than the sum of the powers for the separate components, depending on their phase difference. This causes changes in the electron temperature and effective collision frequency, leading to self-demodulation and variations in the polarization of the composite wave over the modulation cycle.
