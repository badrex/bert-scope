tldr: This article discusses the recognition and dating of deep sea unconformities in the North Atlantic using seismic reflexion and well data. It highlights how these unconformities can be used to subdivide the stratigraphic section into genetically related intervals, providing a regional framework for interpreting depositional environments, lithofacies, and structure. The study also proposes global relative changes of sea level as a possible cause of the deep sea unconformities, which can be a practical method of global correlation.
