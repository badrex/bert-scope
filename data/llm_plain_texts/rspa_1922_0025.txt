tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the molecular scattering of light in water and its color. They found that water scatters light 159 times more strongly than dust-free air, and the observed luminosity and color of water are determined by molecular diffraction. The study also provides a theoretical calculation and experimental observations of the intensity of molecular scattering in water.
