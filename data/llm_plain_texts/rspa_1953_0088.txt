tldr: This article presents an approximate theory to determine the flow in a high-pressure valve. The author investigates the dependence of the flow on parameters such as the initial pressure ratio, the speed of opening, and the design of the valve. The study focuses on an idealized type of valve, and the results indicate the possible types of motion and their dependence on the mentioned parameters. The analysis can be applied to a specific type of valve, and the findings have implications for the design of nozzles and the starting of subsonic/supersonic effusors.
