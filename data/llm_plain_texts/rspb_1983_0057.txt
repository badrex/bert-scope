tldr: The authors studied two species of loricate choanoflagellates, Calotheca alata and Syndetophyllum pulchellum, using electron microscopy. They discovered unique morphological adaptations in the lorica construction, such as interlocking devices between costal strips, which help classify these species and understand their taxonomic relationships. Both species are found in warmer waters with full salinity.
