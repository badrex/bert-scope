semantic_tags:
  - Electron scattering
  - Molecular hydrogen
  - Born theory
  - Oppenheimer modification
  - Franck-Condon principle
tldr: This article explores the collision of electrons with molecules using the Born and Oppenheimer theories. It focuses on the elastic scattering of electrons in molecular hydrogen and nitrogen, discussing the relation between X-ray and electron scattering. The authors also consider energy interchange between electrons and molecules, emphasizing the importance of the Franck-Condon principle in understanding inelastic scattering and molecular excitation.
