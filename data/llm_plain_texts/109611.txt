tldr: The author, Timothy Lane, investigated the magnetism of iron oxides and found that they are not magnetic until inflammable substances are chemically combined with them through heat. When the combustible substance is separated by heat, the oxides return to their unmagnetic state. This study helps to understand why certain iron compounds become magnetic and then lose their magnetic properties under specific conditions.
