tldr: The article discusses the application of phase integral methods to analyze radio transmission problems. It demonstrates the existence of proper values for various wave-lengths and density distributions in the layer, which can be used to understand the nature of transmission and attenuation suffered by waves. The phase integral method also provides a way to account for the Earth's resistivity in radio transmission phenomena.
