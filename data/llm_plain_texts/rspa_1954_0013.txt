tldr: The authors conducted a detailed analytical study of the cool-flame oxidation of propane using a continuous-flow technique. They demonstrated the formation of three theoretically possible aldehydes and identified the initially formed peroxide as hydrogen peroxide. The results confirmed earlier conclusions that aldehydes are the important branching agents in the temperature range of 300 to 400Â°C. The study provided further evidence that aldehydes, rather than peroxides, are the key intermediates in low-temperature oxidation, and explained the periodic phenomena associated with cool flames.
