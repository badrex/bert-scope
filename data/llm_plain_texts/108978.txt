tldr: The author examines the unimpregnated and impregnated eggs of osseous fishes, specifically Gasterosteus species, to understand their structure, physical and chemical properties, and development. They describe the micropyle, the germinal pole, and the formative yelk, which plays a role in the transformation of the egg during development. The study provides insights into fish reproduction and embryology.
