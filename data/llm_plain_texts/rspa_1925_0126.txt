revised_title: Osmotic Pressure of Hemoglobin in the Absence of Salts
semantic_tags:
  - Hemoglobin
  - Osmotic pressure
  - Protein solutions
  - Molecular weight
  - Ionic impurities
tldr: The author investigates the osmotic pressure of purified hemoglobin solutions in the absence of salts. They find that the molecular weight of hemoglobin is three to four times its equivalent weight, and suggest that irregular osmotic effects in previous studies may have been caused by ionic impurities rather than changes in aggregation.
