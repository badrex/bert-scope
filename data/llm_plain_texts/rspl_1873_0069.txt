tldr: The author, J. Norman Lockyer, observed new absorption phenomena and spectral line behaviors in vapor heated in a red-hot tube. These phenomena include unilateral widening of the D line, different absorption boundaries, and brilliant boundaries. The findings suggest that line-spectra may be a special case of molecular combinations and that short lines in spectra might be remnants of channelled-space spectra.
