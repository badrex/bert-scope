tldr: This study investigates the blood pressure and flow rate in the giraffe jugular vein, finding that the internal pressure is above atmospheric and increases with height above the heart. A model of viscous flow in a collapsible tube suggests that the observed pressure distribution may be due to the intrinsic cross-sectional area and/or compliance of the veins increasing towards the heart or external tissue pressure decreasing. The analysis also considers the effect of fluid inertia on steady flow in vertical collapsible tubes and discusses the possibility of flow limitation, which could limit cerebral blood flow by downstream conditions rather than local requirements.
