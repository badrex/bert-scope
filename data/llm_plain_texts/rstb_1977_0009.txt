tldr: 'This article discusses the impact of human activities, such as agriculture and industrial processes, on atmospheric nitrogen and ozone levels. The authors argue that these activities may lead to an increase in atmospheric nitrogen, which could have consequences for ozone levels. They also explore the potential effects of chlorofluorocarbons and methylbromide on ozone levels. The authors suggest that appropriate source regulation could minimize these impacts.'
