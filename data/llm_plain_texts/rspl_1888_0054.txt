tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments to measure the specific resistance of mercury using various tubes and techniques. They compared their results with previous studies and found a final value of r = 0.95352 B.A. units. The differences between their results and other researchers, such as Lord Rayleigh, are discussed but not fully explained.'
