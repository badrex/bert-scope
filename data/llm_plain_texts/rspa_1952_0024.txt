tldr: The authors studied the ionization produced by metallic salts in flames and found that the stability of gaseous alkali hydroxides plays a significant role in the electron concentration. They discovered that the electron concentration is affected by the formation of hydroxyl ions, which is independent of the metal added. The results imply an electron affinity for gaseous OH of 2.5 eV, which agrees reasonably with previous measurements.
