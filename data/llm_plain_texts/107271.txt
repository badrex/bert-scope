tldr: This article discusses the role of nerves and electricity in animal secretions. The author, Everard Home, explores the connection between nerves and secretions, as well as the effects of electricity on animal fluids. He also investigates the potential use of electricity in separating and forming new combinations of blood components. The author suggests that a low electrical power may be employed for these purposes and could be used as a chemical test for electricity.
