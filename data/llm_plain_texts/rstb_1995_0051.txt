tldr: 'The article discusses the role of molecular chaperones in protein folding, focusing on the cooperation between Hsp70 and Hsp60 families in a coordinated cellular protein folding pathway. Chaperones stabilize unfolded proteins, preventing aggregation and promoting correct folding through ATP-dependent binding and release. The Hsp70 system and chaperonin system work together to assist in the folding of newly synthesized polypeptides in the cytosol, mitochondria, and chloroplasts.'
