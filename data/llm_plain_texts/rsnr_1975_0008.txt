tldr: This article discusses the financial support provided by the Royal Society for the publication of Bertrand Russell and A. N. Whitehead's groundbreaking work, Principia Mathematica. The article describes the negotiations with the Cambridge University Press, the involvement of the Royal Society, and the events surrounding the publication and subsequent reissue of the work. Principia Mathematica is a detailed account of the authors' logicist thesis that mathematics can be derived solely from logical concepts and by logical methods, and has had a significant influence on mathematical logic, set theory, the foundations of mathematics, linguistic analysis, and analytical philosophy.
