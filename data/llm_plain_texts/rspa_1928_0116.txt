tldr: The authors studied the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen in a homogeneous environment. They found that the reaction's rate depends on the concentration of hydrogen and oxygen, and it is influenced by temperature, pressure, and the presence of steam. The reaction is also affected by the presence of an inert gas, which increases the reaction rate by prolonging the life of active molecules that would otherwise be deactivated by contact with the vessel's surface.
