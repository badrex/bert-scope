tldr: This article discusses the process of visual information processing and the construction of visual representations in the human brain. It presents a framework for extracting shape information from images, involving three representations: the primal sketch, the 2-D sketch, and the 3-D model representation. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding the computational problems that need to be solved in vision and the need for a top-level theory of computation in the study of visual perception.
