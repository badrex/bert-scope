tldr: This paper explores the use of quaternions in projective geometry, specifically focusing on line transformations and their applications. The authors discuss various types of covariance and the decomposition of line transformations, highlighting the importance of quaternions in understanding these concepts. The paper also touches upon the use of quaternions in the study of liquid rotations and the conditions required for transformations to be possible.
