tldr: This article reviews the palaeomagnetic evidence that contributes to the understanding of the evolution of the Canadian Cordillera. The authors discuss the concept of terranes and their formation, as well as the four main themes of Cordilleran palaeomagnetism, including large rotations about vertical axes, apparent displacement from the south, data from older sequences, and the difficulties in interpreting palaeomagnetic data in orogenic regions.
