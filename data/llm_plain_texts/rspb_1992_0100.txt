tldr: Researchers discovered that they could selectively and reversibly impair visual motion perception by stimulating a small region of the cortex corresponding to human area V5 using transcranial magnetic stimulation. This allowed them to study the backward influence of area V5 on area VI and the importance of re-entrant signals from V5 to VI for conscious visual motion perception. The findings provide insights into the functioning of the visual cortex and the perception of motion.
