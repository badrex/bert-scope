tldr: The authors present the third installment of their research on solar physics, focusing on the areas and heliographic positions of sunspots observed by the Kew photoheliograph from 1867 to 1869. They discuss the superiority of photographic sun-observations over previous methods and the distribution of sunspots on the solar surface. The authors also express the need for further study of solar flares and hope for more extensive photographic sun-observation systems in the future.
