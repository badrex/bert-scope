tldr: 'In 1847, George W. Keely conducted magnetic observations in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick to determine the magnetic inclination and force. He used Lloyd needles and a unifilar magnetometer to collect data. The results showed that both needles experienced a loss of force over time, and the mean values of the magnetic intensity were calculated. These observations helped to better understand the Earth's magnetic field in the region.'
