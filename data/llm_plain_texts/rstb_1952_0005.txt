revised_title: 'Internal Waves and Water Movements in Stratified Lakes'
semantic_tags:
  - Limnology
  - Internal waves
  - Lake stratification
  - Water movement
  - Temperature distribution
tldr: The authors study the movements of water in lakes during summer stratification, focusing on Windermere. They examine the role of temperature in creating internal waves and the impact of wind on water movement. The authors also discuss the use of thermoelectric instruments for measuring temperature distribution in lakes.
