tldr: The author conducted experiments on the spinal cord to understand its role in sensibility and voluntary movements. They discovered that the lateral columns of the spinal cord, near the medulla oblongata, and a part of the anterior gray matter are the main channels for voluntary movements. The anterior columns and gray matter in the dorsal and lumbar regions seem to be the conductors for voluntary movements. The author also found that the anterior columns have a thin layer of fibers that transmit sensitive impressions, but they are not sensitive to pain.
