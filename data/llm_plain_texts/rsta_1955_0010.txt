tldr: The authors prove isolation theorems for the minima of factorizable homogeneous ternary cubic forms and indefinite ternary quadratic forms of a new strong type. They demonstrate the equivalence of this problem with another problem in the geometry of numbers and contribute to the study of the problem of finding real numbers x, y, and z such that a determinant has a positive lower bound for all integers x, y, and z.
