revised_title: 'Penicillin and its Mechanism of Action on Bacterial Cell Walls'

tldr: The article discusses how penicillin and related antibiotics inhibit the biosynthesis of bacterial cell walls. It explains that penicillins and cephalosporins target the transpeptidation reaction, which is the final step in cell wall synthesis. The authors describe the structure of bacterial cell walls, the role of transpeptidase in cross-linking, and the mechanism of action of penicillin on the transpeptidase enzyme.
