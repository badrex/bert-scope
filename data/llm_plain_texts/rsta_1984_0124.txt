tldr: This study investigates optical phase conjugation through degenerate four-wave mixing in copper chloride, focusing on the effects of light frequency, intensity, polarization, and sample temperature. The phase-conjugate signal exhibits two maxima at the frequencies of the exciton and biexciton, with the biexciton two-photon resonance being particularly effective in phase conjugation. The research also explores the phase-conjugate nature of the signal and its potential applications in optical imaging.
