tldr: This study examines the post-glacial history of British vegetation in the Somerset Levels, focusing on the correlation between climate, forest composition, prehistoric agriculture, and peat stratigraphy. The research identifies two phases of agricultural activity, one in the late Bronze Age and the other in the Iron Age to middle Romano-British period. The findings suggest that both phases were terminated by wet conditions that led to flooding of the raised bogs. The study also reveals a strong correlation between climate and forest composition, indicating that climate change played a significant role in the observed modifications.
