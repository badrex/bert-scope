tldr: Mr. Leewenhoeck conducted experiments to understand the compression of air and the behavior of particles passing through glass. He used a glass-pipe filled with water and applied pressure to compress the air inside. He observed that the air could not be compressed without the glass particles being displaced, suggesting that air consists of different types of matter. He also experimented with a wider glass-pipe to see if larger particles could be forced through the glass, but found that the water at the small hole remained stationary despite the air being pressed out. This phenomenon puzzled him and he could not find a satisfactory explanation.
