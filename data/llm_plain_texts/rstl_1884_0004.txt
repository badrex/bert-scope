tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the effect of pressure on the volatilization temperature of solids, specifically ice. They found that the temperature of volatilization of ice is dependent on the pressure in the system, and that the pressure can be influenced by the temperature of the condenser. This research helped to further understand the behavior of solids under different pressures and temperatures.
