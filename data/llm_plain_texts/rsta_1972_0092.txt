tldr: The author investigates non-symmetric flow in Laval type nozzles and develops a method to design an optimum nozzle that minimizes turning moments and lateral forces, even when the flow from the combustion chamber is non-symmetric. The study includes theoretical calculations and experimental tests with model rockets, confirming the accuracy of the equations in specifying the optimum nozzle design.
