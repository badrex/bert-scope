tldr: The author examines the development of Lichenopora verrucaria, a type of bryozoan, and discovers that embryonic fission is a normal process in its growth. They also observe the relationship between the young ovicell and the fertile zooecium, as well as the role of polypides in the healthy development of embryos. This research provides insight into the life cycle and growth patterns of this marine organism.
