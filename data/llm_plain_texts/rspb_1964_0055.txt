revised_title: 'The Structure and Function of Actin Filaments in Muscular Contraction'
semantic_tags:
  - Muscle Contraction
  - Actin Filaments

  - Muscle Fibers
  - Striated Muscle
tldr: The authors discuss the structure of actin filaments and their role in muscular contraction. They find that actin filaments have a specific structure that matches the axial periodicity in the I-substance of vertebrate striated muscle. This discovery helps to understand the location of actin filaments in the contractile apparatus of various muscles and contributes to the study of muscular contraction.
