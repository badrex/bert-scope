  - Ascorbic Acid and Glutathione Oxidation-Reduction Systems
tldr: This study investigates the effects of prolonged exposure to pure oxygen on potato tuber metabolism. The research shows that oxygen poisoning inhibits respiration, creates a block in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and alters the ascorbic acid and glutathione oxidation-reduction systems. These findings contribute to the understanding of the various metabolic phenomena observed in both plant and animal tissues under the term "oxygen poisoning."
