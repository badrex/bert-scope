tldr: The authors conducted experiments in a wind tunnel to study the flow of air over an aerofoil of infinite span. They compared theoretical and experimental distributions of pressure and streamlines, providing an experimental verification of the Prandtl theory. The study focused on the relationship between circulation, lift, and the flow of a viscous fluid around the aerofoil.
