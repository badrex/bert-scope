tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the relationship between the medial mamillary nucleus and the cingulate cortex. They observed cellular changes in the mamillary nuclei following lesions of the cingulate cortex, the anterior thalamic radiation, and the anterior thalamic nuclei in rabbits. The severity of these changes was found to be related to the age of the animal and the post-operative survival period. The study helped determine the specific connections between the medial mamillary nucleus and the cingulate cortex.
