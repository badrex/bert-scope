tldr: The authors studied the coupling process at the triadic junctions in skeletal muscle fibers and found a significant temperature dependence in the triadic delay. They used optical techniques to record the depolarization of the transverse tubular membrane and calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, suggesting that a sequence of chemical steps may link the electrical signal in the tubules to the opening of calcium channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum.
