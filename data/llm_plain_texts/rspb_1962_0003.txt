revised_title: 'Spectroscopic Properties of Haem a Compounds and Their Relevance to Cytochromes'

  - Absorption Spectra
tldr: The authors studied the absorption spectra of haem a compounds with proteins and other nitrogenous ligands, finding that they provide a good model for bacterial cytochrome a but differ from cytochrome a3 and, to a lesser extent, cytochrome a. They also found no evidence for a reversible combination of haem a-globin with molecular oxygen.
