tldr: The author determines the normal-mode frequencies of a Reissner-Nordström black hole using a phase-amplitude formula and numerical integration in the complex coordinate plane. The results extend previous research and discuss the change in characteristic frequencies as the black hole's charge increases. The study contributes to understanding space and time and may provide insights into perturbed Kerr black holes.
