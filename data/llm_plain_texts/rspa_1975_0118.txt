tldr: The authors present the tunable spin-flip Raman laser's application in continuous wave molecular spectroscopy. They demonstrate its potential by studying various molecules, including nitric oxide, carbonyl sulphide, stibine, water vapor, and deuterium bromide. The spin-flip laser's linewidth varies significantly, showing its potential for high-resolution spectroscopy even under poor resolution conditions. The authors also discuss the experimental setup, results, and analysis of vibration-rotation bands of carbonyl sulphide.
