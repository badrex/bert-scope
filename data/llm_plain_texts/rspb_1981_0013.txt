tldr: This article addresses criticisms and misinterpretations of a mechanical model for tendons, specifically the planar zig-zag model. The authors clarify a misprint in their earlier paper and emphasize the importance of direct structural evidence to support mechanical models. They also highlight the predictive power and structural evidence supporting their model, which is based on the elastica theory and identifies the collagen microfibril as the load-bearing element.
