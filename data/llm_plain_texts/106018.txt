tldr: The author investigates the nature of the mineral elastic spirit or air contained in Pouhon water and other acidulae. They discover that the mephitic air in these waters keeps certain earths dissolved and that this air is the medium for the solution. The author also observes that when the water is exposed to heat or cold, the air separates from the water, causing the earths to separate as well. This research contributes to the understanding of the chemical composition and properties of mineral waters.
