tldr: The study examines parallels between two species of lizards on the islands of Dominica and Basse Terre, showing that similar ecological gradients influence morphological and mitochondrial DNA variation. The findings support the idea that natural selection plays a role in shaping these patterns, rather than historical events or genetic drift.
