tldr: This article discusses various industrial electrochemical cell designs, such as filterpress-type cells, Seachlor cells, Chemelec cells, fluidized-bed cells, and fixed bed cells, and their suitability for different applications. The author also highlights the importance of considering the entire process when optimizing cell performance, rather than focusing on the cell alone, to avoid misleading results and potential issues in the engineering of the process.
