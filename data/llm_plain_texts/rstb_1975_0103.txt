tldr: The study examines the morphological changes in the thymus gland of red-billed queleas (Quelea quelea) and its relation to erythropoietic activity. The thymus enlarges in young birds after hatching and remains enlarged during the juvenile stage. In adults, thymus recrudescence occurs during prenuptial and postnuptial moults and briefly during the breeding season. The enlargement of the thymus in both young and adults is associated with increased erythropoietic activity, which may be related to the increased demand for erythrocytes during moult and breeding.
