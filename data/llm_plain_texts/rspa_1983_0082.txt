tldr: This article presents a high-resolution experimental study of stacking fault contrast in X-ray diffraction. The authors investigate a stacking fault in a nearly perfect diamond and analyze the resulting fringe patterns and dynamical diffraction effects. They compare experimental images with computer simulations and discuss the implications of their findings for understanding stacking fault contrast in X-ray diffraction.
