  - Spermatozoa
  - Plasmalogen
  - Oxidative Stress
  - Semen Storage
tldr: The authors investigated the formation of lipid peroxides in spermatozoa and its impact on sperm viability. They found that lipid peroxidation, particularly affecting plasmalogens, leads to a decline in sperm motility and viability. Preventing peroxide formation could be crucial for long-term sperm storage for artificial insemination.
