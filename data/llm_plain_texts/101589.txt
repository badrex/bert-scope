tldr: 'In this series of experiments, Robert Boyle investigates the effects of air pressure and absence on various animals, including ducks, vipers, and frogs. He observes how these animals respond to changes in air pressure and how it affects their respiration and survival. These experiments contribute to the understanding of the importance of air for life and the development of gas laws.'
