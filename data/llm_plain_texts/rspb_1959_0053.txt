tldr: The study investigates the distribution of mitoses and cell growth in the tissues of the rabbit mandibular incisor. It found that young animals had more mitoses near the socket walls, and rapidly erupting incisors had 1.4 times more mitoses than their normally erupting counterparts. The research also discovered that the pulp's cell density was maintained by cell migration from the periphery, and the distribution of mitoses in the periodontal tissues may be related to the processes that allow the incisor to erupt while remaining anchored to its socket.
