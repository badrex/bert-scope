tldr: This study investigates the influence of high pore-water pressure on the strength of cohesionless soils. The authors examine the possible errors associated with using current expressions for intergranular stress and effective stress at high pore pressures and low yield stresses. They conducted a very accurate experimental investigation using various particulate materials, such as quartz sand and lead shot, to analyze the sensitivity of shearing resistance to large changes in pore pressure. The results indicate that the simple Terzaghi effective stress equation is consistent with the observations, although additional confirmatory evidence is desirable for quartz sand.
