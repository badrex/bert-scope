tldr: 'A moving bog in Ireland was observed by John Honohane and reported by William Molyneux. The bog moved and covered a meadow, creating a significant impact on the landscape. The author suggests that the movement was caused by an unusually wet spring, which led to the bog's swelling and sinking, and the subsequent pressure on the surrounding land. This phenomenon puzzled observers, but Honohane's explanation provides a natural cause for the event.'
