tldr: The author conducted a series of experiments on dogs to study the reproduction of nerves and their impact on vital organs. They found that when one of the nerves in the eighth pair was divided, the animal experienced distress and eventually died. However, when the division of the second nerve was delayed, the animal's vital organs recovered, suggesting that the first nerve had been reproduced. This study highlights the importance of understanding nerve regeneration and its effects on the body.
