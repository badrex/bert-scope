tldr: The authors studied the structure and properties of tropomyosin, a protein found in muscles. They discovered that tropomyosin has a particle weight of 53,000 and a double-chain model best represents its structure. Tropomyosin's unique properties, such as its high net charge and resistance to denaturation, suggest it may be a cyclic polypeptide. Further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis.
