tldr: This study examines the Foraminifera found in the green ammonite beds of the Lower Lias in Dorset. The author, W. A. Macfayden, analyzed over 700 mounted specimens from the area, identifying six families, twenty genera, and fifty-five species. The research provides evidence for the zonal ranges of the Dorset species and offers a tentative correlation of the zoning of the Lias by various authors. The study also discusses the evolution of new types of Foraminifera in the Lias and the challenges in naming and classifying them due to their wide variation within groups.
