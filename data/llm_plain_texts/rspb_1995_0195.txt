tldr: Researchers conducted displacement experiments with young autumn migrating wheatears along the Arctic coast of Russia to test the clock-and-compass orientation and goal-area navigation hypotheses. The wheatears' orientation changed as they got access to directional information from stars, and the results did not support either hypothesis. This suggests that additional factors, not yet understood, affect the birds' orientation in field tests.
