tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the reaction between nitrogen and hydrogen when activated by electrons. They used a modified experimental setup and a Pirani gauge to measure the rate of reaction as a function of electron speeds. The results showed that the rate of reaction increased at specific electron speeds, which were associated with the potentials required to produce molecular and atomic ions of nitrogen. The study aimed to obtain more accurate values of these critical potentials and to search for new ones.
