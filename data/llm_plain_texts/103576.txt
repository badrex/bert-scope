tldr: Antony van Leeuwenhoek shares his observations on muscular fibers in various animals under a microscope and the magnetic properties of iron. He discovered that the muscular fibers of different animals have similar structures, and he tested the magnetic properties of iron from a church steeple, finding that it had a strong magnetic quality after being in the same position for a long time.
