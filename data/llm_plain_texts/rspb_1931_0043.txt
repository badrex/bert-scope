tldr: This study investigates the effects of body temperature and physical work on sweating and sweat composition. The experiments show that sweat excretion decreases with prolonged rest, but remains relatively constant during physical work. The results also indicate that sweat glands can become fatigued, leading to a decrease in sweat excretion over time. The study highlights the importance of acclimatization and individual differences in sweat composition and rate of sweating.
