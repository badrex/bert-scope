tldr: The authors used thermal desorption and electron energy loss spectroscopy to study the structures of unsaturated hydrocarbons chemisorbed on metal single-crystal surfaces, focusing on cis- and trans-but-2-ene, but-2-yne, and buta-1,3-diene on Pt(111). They found that the low-temperature species were di-a-adsorbed, and chemisorption occurred without isomerization about the C=C bond. The spectra and composition data for the but-2-enes were different from but-1-ene, showing that double-bond migration did not occur along the C4 chain and that the but-2-enes did not give the butylidyne structure.
