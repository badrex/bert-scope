tldr: This article discusses the importance of prosodic structures in the early stages of language acquisition. The authors argue that infants use these structures to learn the language processing routines that adults employ. They also explore how infants raised in multilingual environments can avoid confusion when learning multiple languages. The research highlights the role of prosodic properties in speech processing and how they are affected by the rhythmical structures of different languages.
