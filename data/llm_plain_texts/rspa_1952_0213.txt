tldr: This study investigates the height and length of ocean waves and swell in relation to wind strength, extent, and duration in the generating area, as well as the subsequent travel of the swell through calm and disturbed water. The research provides a basis for making reasonably accurate predictions of waves and swell from meteorological charts and forecasts.
