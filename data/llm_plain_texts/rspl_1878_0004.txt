tldr: The author discusses the limits to the order and degree of fundamental invariants of binary quantics, presenting a table of mean results for elements of terrestrial magnetism. The paper explores the theory of canonical forms and the algebraic limits of invariants, comparing two methods of dealing with invariants and their covariants.
