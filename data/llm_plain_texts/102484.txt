tldr: Dr. Geo. Garden discovered the life cycle of a fruit-destroying caterpillar by observing its eggs in the cavities of pear and apple tree bearers. He found that the caterpillars hatch from these eggs in the spring and are destroyed by early heat followed by frosty weather. This discovery sheds light on the insect's reproduction and provides insights into controlling these pests.
