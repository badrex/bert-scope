tldr: The author examines the developmental stages of the brain in the European herring (Clupea harengus) through various stages of growth. They describe the changes in the brain's structure, including the olfactory lobes, optic thalami, cerebellum, and other key regions. This study provides valuable insights into the neuroanatomy and development of fish brains, particularly in the early post-larval and later stages.
