tldr: The article presents a computational model for visually guided robot arms that can grasp and transport objects in an obstacle-strewn environment. The model focuses on the visual planning of two-fingered grasps and uses dynamic contours for real-time visual tracking. The authors develop a theory for classifying grasps based on their stability properties and demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through practical computer algorithms.
