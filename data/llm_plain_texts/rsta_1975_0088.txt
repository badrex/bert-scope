tldr: This article discusses the early days of ionospheric research and the theory of electric and magnetic waves in the ionosphere and magnetosphere. It covers the pioneering experiments of Appleton and Barnett, who measured the height of reflection of radio waves, and the development of magnetionic theory. The article also explores various investigations into ionospheric phenomena, radio propagation, and plasma physics.
