tldr: This article investigates the ecological functions and phylogenetic constraints of clonal plants, which can grow and reproduce asexually. The study focuses on the morphological characteristics of clonal growth, such as longevity and connection length, and their relationship with habitat preferences. The research explores the distribution of clonal traits over environmental gradients and examines the impact of phylogenetic heritage on trait-environment relationships.
