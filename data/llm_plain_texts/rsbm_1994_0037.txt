tldr: John Freeman Loutit was a versatile scientist who made significant contributions to radiobiology and haematology. He developed the acid-citrate-dextrose (ACD) solution, which revolutionized blood preservation and transfusion medicine. Loutit's research also led to a better understanding of haemolytic anaemias and the graft versus host reaction. His work had a major impact on the field of blood transfusion and haematology.
