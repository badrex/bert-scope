tldr: This article examines the spark spectrum of argon as it appears in the spark spectrum of air. The author, W. N. Hartley, investigates the lines in the spectrum that cannot be attributed to oxygen or nitrogen and concludes that argon is likely an element rather than a compound. This discovery expands the understanding of the composition of air and the properties of argon as an element.
