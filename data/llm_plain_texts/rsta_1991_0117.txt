tldr: This article presents experimental studies on the oscillatory combustion of hydrogen in a stirred flow reactor. The authors measured the concentrations of atoms and OH radicals, as well as the reactant temperature during the gas-phase combustion. They also investigated the interaction between oscillations in a pair of coupled reactors. The findings provide insights into the complex oscillatory reaction modes and the phase relations between different species concentrations and temperature.
