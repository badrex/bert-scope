tldr: The authors describe a method for accurately measuring the wave-lengths of absorption bands in pigments using the coincidence method. They explain the construction and calibration of a specialized spectroscope and discuss various applications, such as measuring the carbon monoxide saturation in blood pigment. This method provides a more accurate way to study and compare absorption bands in different pigments.
