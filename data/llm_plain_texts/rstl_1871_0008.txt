tldr: The authors describe a new method of obtaining electricity from mechanical force using polarized metallic surfaces in aqueous solutions. They discovered that by manipulating the surface area of mercury in a solution, they could generate an electric current. This process could potentially be useful in investigating the source of force in batteries and understanding the behavior of metallic surfaces in electrolytes.
