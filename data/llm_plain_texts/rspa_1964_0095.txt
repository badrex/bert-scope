tldr: The authors calculate the fifth virial coefficient of a fluid of hard spheres, which is a sum of 238 irreducible cluster integrals. They provide values for five types of these integrals analytically, and the contributions of four other types through a combination of analytical and numerical integration. The result is used to improve the understanding of fluid properties and test approximations in the theory of fluids at equilibrium.
