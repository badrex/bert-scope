tldr: The authors analyze the spectrum of H2, identifying various band systems and branches, and provide a detailed classification of the lines and transitions involved. They also discuss the intensity distribution and the rotational structure of the band systems, confirming the close analogy between the spectrum of H2 and the line spectrum of orthohelium.
