tldr: The author investigates the nutrition of early embryos, specifically in guinea pigs and humans. They suggest that the embryo's nutrition is anticipated and provided for during the time it remains free in the uterine horn. The author proposes that the outermost cells of the embryo, the Trophoblast, play a crucial role in breaking down maternal cells and assimilating the secretions of the uterine or other glands. This process helps provide nourishment for the embryo until it attaches to the uterine wall.
