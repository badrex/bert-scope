tldr: This article explores the irreversible approach to equilibrium in glasses, focusing on the kinetics of glass formation and stabilization processes. The authors introduce an ordering parameter to represent the configurational state of the system and discuss the concept of fictive temperature. They also study the behavior of organic glasses like glycerol and glucose, providing insights into the volume viscosity and relaxation times of these substances.
