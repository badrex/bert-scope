tldr: The authors studied the properties and synthesis of safranine, a red tar-pigment used as a dye for silk and cotton. They analyzed its chemical structure and various salts, such as chlorhydrate, platinum salt, nitrate, and picrate. Safranine is derived from aromatic azodiamines and has a complex chemical composition, making it an important compound for further investigation.
