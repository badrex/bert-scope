tldr: The authors studied the cell walls of Vaucheriaceae and Saprolegniaceae species using X-ray analysis and electron microscopy, and determined their chemical composition through hydrolysis and paper partition chromatography. They found differences and similarities between the two groups, with Saprolegniaceae containing large amounts of alkali-soluble polysaccharides, while Vaucheria species have a higher proportion of native cellulose in their cell walls. This research contributes to understanding the chemical composition and structure of these organisms' cell walls, which may help reveal their phylogenetic relationships.
