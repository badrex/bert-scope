tldr: The authors investigated the specific heat of the hydrogen molecule using wave mechanics. They proposed that the molecule's nuclear spin causes symmetrical and antisymmetrical states, which affect the specific heat. By assuming that these states do not combine, they found that the observed specific heat curve can be explained with a ratio of three antisymmetrical to one symmetrical molecule.
