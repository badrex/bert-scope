tldr: 'Herbert Frohlich was a renowned theoretical physicist who made significant contributions to the fields of quantum mechanics, superconductivity, solid-state physics, and particle physics. He developed a theory of dielectric behavior and worked on the unsolved problem of superconductivity, pointing out that electron-phonon interaction could produce a weak attraction between electrons. Frohlich also created a new subject, applying concepts from his work on solid-state physics to biology. Throughout his life, he maintained a deep interest in particle physics and made important contributions to the field.'
