tldr: This article discusses the zoological expeditions to the Krakatau Islands in 1984 and 1985, focusing on the freshwater communities found in three small ponds. The authors discovered that each pond had a different dominant taxon and that the overall macro-invertebrate communities were less diverse than in the larger freshwater and brackish habitats previously present on the islands. The article also records the first sightings of Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera on the Krakatau Islands.
