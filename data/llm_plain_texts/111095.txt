tldr: The author, Henry Bence Jones, studied the variations of sulphates and phosphates in the urine of patients with different diseases. He found that in acute chorea, the sulphates and urea in the urine were greatly increased. In delirium tremens, the same state of urine was often observed when phosphates were not increased. In acute inflammation of the nervous structures, both sulphates and phosphates were increased in the urine. In chronic diseases, no significant increase in sulphates or phosphates was observed, except after taking sulphate of magnesia. The results suggest that muscular action increases sulphates in the urine without increasing phosphates, while inflammation of the brain increases both sulphates and phosphates in the urine.
