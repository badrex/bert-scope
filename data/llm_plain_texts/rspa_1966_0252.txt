tldr: The authors studied the de Haas-van Alphen effect in sodium to determine the shape of its Fermi surface. They used a sensitive detection system to measure the oscillations in magnetization and found that the Fermi surface of sodium is less distorted than previously thought. The results were used to deduce the Fourier components of the effective lattice potential, which agreed with previous models.
