tldr: The authors studied the effect of pH on the blockage of the cyclic GMP-activated conductance in salamander rods by L-cis-diltiazem and amiloride. They found that the level of blockage changed with cytoplasmic pH, suggesting that the protonated form of the blocker is responsible for the effect. This is in contrast to previous findings in catfish cones, which showed no change in blockage with pH. The results imply that there may be fundamental differences in the interaction of blockers with rod and cone conductances.
