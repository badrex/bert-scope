tldr: The authors present a Hamiltonian description of massless spin zero- and one-fields in Minkowski space, focusing on radiative modes at null infinity. They introduce a phase space for the gravitational field's radiative degrees of freedom, equipped with a continuous, weakly non-degenerate symplectic structure. The action of the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs group on null infinity induces canonical transformations on this phase space, providing a new approach to the quantization of the gravitational field's true degrees of freedom.
