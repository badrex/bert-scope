tldr: The authors conducted experiments with cinchona alkaloids and their derivatives to study their antiplasmodial properties. They found that the cinchona alkaloids are active against bird malaria, and the antiplasmodial action is sensitive to changes in chemical structure. The study provides insights into the potential mechanism of destruction of the parasite and the role of the central -CHOH- group in the cinchona alkaloids.
