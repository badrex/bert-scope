tldr: This study investigates the transmission of environmental effects from parent to offspring in the daphnid Simocephalus vetulus. The research shows that environmental changes can affect the offspring's physical characteristics, such as the ratio of their total length to the width of their carapace. These changes can persist through generations, demonstrating a case of "parallel induction." The findings suggest that environmental factors alter the metabolic products in the protoplasm, which are then passed on to the next generation, influencing their development.
