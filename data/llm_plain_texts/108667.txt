tldr: This article presents a comprehensive study on the electric conducting power of various metals. The author, Augustus Matthiessen, determined the conducting powers of numerous metals and alloys, including silver, gold, zinc, and others. The study also explores the relationship between temperature and conducting power, as well as the differences in conducting power between various types of cokes and graphites. Matthiessen's findings contribute to the understanding of electrical conductivity in metals and the potential applications in thermoelectric batteries.
