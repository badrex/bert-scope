tldr: The authors conducted experiments on a copper wire to study the effects of magnetization on its electrical resistance. They discovered that when the wire was magnetized, it initially showed an increase in resistance, followed by a consistent decrease in resistance while the magnetism was on. The first effect of magnetization was found to depend on the previous state of the wire, the solidity of the circuit, and the magnetization itself.
