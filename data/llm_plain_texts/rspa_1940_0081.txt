  - Proton transfer reactions
  - Potential energy curves
  - Acid-base catalysis
  - Ionic and covalent binding
  - Reaction kinetics
tldr: The authors discuss the potential energy curves involved in proton transfer reactions, specifically focusing on base-catalyzed prototropy of ketones. They find that the covalent binding picture is inadequate to explain the observed relations between basic strength and catalytic power. Instead, they propose that the ionic state plays a significant role in these reactions, providing a more accurate representation of the experimental facts.
