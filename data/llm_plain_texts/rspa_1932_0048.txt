tldr: This article investigates the flow of a compressible liquid through a constriction in a circular wind channel. It examines two cases of flow: symmetrical flow about the surface and non-symmetrical flow. The study focuses on the velocity and sound velocities in these cases, providing mathematical solutions and comparing them to experimental results.
