tldr: The authors discuss the differences between amblygonite and montebrasite, two minerals found in various locations. They analyze their physical and chemical properties, crystal systems, and optical characteristics, concluding that they are distinct species. Amblygonite should be retained for the sodolithic species found in Penig, while montebrasite should encompass hydrated and lithic species from other locations.
