tldr: This article presents a detailed study of the dilatation and compressibility of liquid carbonic acid. The authors describe the experimental setup and techniques used, including a dilatometer and a calorimeter, to measure the volume changes and pressure effects on the liquid. The results provide valuable insights into the physical properties of carbonic acid, which can be applied to various scientific and industrial processes.
