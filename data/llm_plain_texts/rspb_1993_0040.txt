tldr: The author investigates the organization of neural systems in the primate cerebral cortex using optimization analysis. They examine the connections between cortical areas and suggest a gross topological organization of the cortical information processing system. This analysis helps understand the place of individual areas within the organization and may provide insights for further research.
