tldr: This article presents the botanical and chemical results of experiments conducted on the mixed herbage of permanent meadows over a period of more than 20 years. The authors describe the different manuring agents used and their effects on the growth and composition of the herbage. They also discuss the challenges and methods involved in separating and analyzing the various plant species in the samples. The study provides insights into the relationship between plant growth, soil fertility, and manure application in meadow ecosystems.
