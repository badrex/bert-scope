tldr: The author examines the scattering of light by solid substances, focusing on glasses, crystals, and quartz. They discover that glass and some crystal specimens scatter light due to inclusions, while clear quartz scatters much less light. The study also explores the polarization and optical properties of scattered light in various materials.
