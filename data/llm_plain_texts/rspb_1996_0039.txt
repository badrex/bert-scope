tldr: This study investigates the effect of indirect sexual selection on offspring fitness in nine natural populations of seaweed flies. It examines the relationship between female mating preferences and offspring fitness based on different inversion karyotypes. The results show that indirect sexual selection operates differently on the two forms of the inversion and is associated with tidal range. The findings provide insights into the evolution of female choice and the role of both "good genes" and Fisherian processes in shaping mating preferences.
