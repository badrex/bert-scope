tldr: The authors study the evolution of travelling waves in reaction-diffusion equations with abruptly decreasing diffusivity. They focus on the effects of an abrupt diffusivity cut-off on the chemical concentration and the formation of travelling wave structures. The research provides insights into the polymerization processes and the behavior of chemical species in different zones.
