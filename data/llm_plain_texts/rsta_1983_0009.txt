tldr: The article describes the structure of a weak thermohaline front in the ocean, observed during the Joint Air-Sea Interaction Project (JASIN). The front, located in an eddy, has a narrow thermocline with a width of 500 m or less. The temperature and salinity structures are mutually compensating in density, resulting in small baroclinicity. The front is advected through the observational array at 0.75 km/h, and its along-front structure is investigated using current meter measurements. The study provides insights into the physical properties of the front and compares the observed thermoclinic structure with numerical models.
