tldr: The article discusses the complex dynamics of advanced compliant off-shore structures, focusing on the nonlinearities and resonances in bilinear and impact oscillators. The authors highlight the dangers of missing subharmonic resonances due to coexisting stable solutions and the importance of exploring a comprehensive set of initial conditions. They also explore the chaotic behavior of these oscillators, which can arise in well-defined deterministic resonance problems, and the need for a statistical description of these motions.
