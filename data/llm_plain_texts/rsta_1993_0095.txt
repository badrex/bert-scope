revised_title: Self-Assembly and Organization in Liquid Crystals: Understanding Liquid Crystal Phases of Amphiphilic Aggregates
semantic_tags:
  - Liquid crystals
  - Amphiphilic aggregates
  - Self-assembly
  - Micelles
  - Phase behavior
tldr: This article discusses the self-assembly and organization of liquid crystals made from amphiphilic aggregates. It explores the different types of liquid crystal phases, such as nematic, smectic, and columnar, and how they form based on the concentration and structure of the aggregates. The article also explains the role of alcohol and salt in modifying the stability of different micelle structures.
