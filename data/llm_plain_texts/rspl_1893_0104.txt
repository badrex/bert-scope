tldr: The author presents a method for determining the properties of cubic curves, specifically focusing on harmonic polars and their relation to the Hessian and Cayleyan curves. The study involves various constructions and graphical representations to understand the behavior of these curves and their inflexional tangents. This work contributes to the understanding of special cubics, such as equian-harmonic cubics, and their significance in the broader context of algebraic geometry.
