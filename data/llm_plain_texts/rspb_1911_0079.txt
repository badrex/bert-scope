tldr: The author examines the morphology of Trypanosoma gambiense and compares it to Trypanosoma brucei. Both species are dimorphic and have similar shapes, but slight differences in size and distribution of forms are observed. The study contributes to understanding the similarities and differences between these two species, which are important for disease transmission and treatment.
