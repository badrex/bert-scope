tldr: This study examines the development of rat and rabbit molars both in vivo and in vitro. The research focuses on the normal development of the first lower molar in rats and the two lower temporary molars in rabbits, comparing it to the development of the teeth in explanted rudiments. The findings provide insight into the factors influencing cusp formation and the effects of extrinsic and intrinsic factors on tooth development.
