tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effects of anaesthetics on isolated nerve tissues and their electrical properties. They discovered that anaesthetics like chloroform and ether affect the injury current and electrical resistance in nerve tissues. The study provides insights into the mechanisms of anaesthesia and the processes of nerve action.
