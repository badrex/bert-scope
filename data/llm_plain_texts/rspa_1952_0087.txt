tldr: This article presents a method for calculating the energy-width of X-ray absorption lines and electron stopping power using a screened Coulomb interaction in a free electron gas. The author derives an expression for the screening parameter and applies it to calculate the energy-width and stopping power, providing high-energy asymptotic expansions for both quantities.
