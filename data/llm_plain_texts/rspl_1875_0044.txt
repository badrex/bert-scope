tldr: The authors present a method for solving systems of simultaneous nonlinear partial differential equations of the first order. They demonstrate the process through various examples, showing how to either find a solution or prove its non-existence. This work contributes to the understanding and application of mathematical analysis in various fields, including physics and engineering.
