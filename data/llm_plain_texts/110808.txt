tldr: George Rainey conducted experiments to study the descending fluids of plants, particularly the cambium. He observed that sap flows from the upper to the lower part of an exogenous tree through continuous vessels. Rainey also noticed that when leaf-buds are active, separations occur between the cells of the bark and the wood, which he believes play a role in the propulsion of sap and the descent of the cambium.
