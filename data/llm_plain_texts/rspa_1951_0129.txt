tldr: The article discusses three iterative procedures related to relaxation methods for solving eigenvalue problems in systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom. The procedures exhibit quadratic, geometric, and cubic convergence, and they are shown to be within the framework of the relaxation method. The study investigates the convergence and behavior of the relaxation method and provides guiding principles for the relaxation computer.
