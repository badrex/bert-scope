tldr: The authors discuss the loss of energy by beta-particles in collisions and compare the results of the classical and quantum theories. They analyze the distribution of energy loss between different types of collisions and the effects of relativity on the collisions. The study provides insights into the behavior of particles with velocities close to the speed of light and the interactions between particles and atoms.
