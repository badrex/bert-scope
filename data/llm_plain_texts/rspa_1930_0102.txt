tldr: This article discusses the experiments conducted to measure the equivalent heights of the ionized regions of the upper atmosphere using short-wave radio waves. The researchers found that the equivalent height of the ionized regions varied with time and location, and they discovered that 100-meter waves could penetrate the lower ionized region during certain times of the day. This research helped to improve our understanding of wireless propagation and the behavior of the ionosphere.
