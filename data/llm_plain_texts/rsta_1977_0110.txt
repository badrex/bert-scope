tldr: The authors conducted calculations of the elastic strain energy of crystallographic shear planes in reduced tungsten trioxide, finding that the magnitude of the energy was in the sequence {103}. They compared these results with experimental observations of crystal structures containing quasi-ordered arrays of shear planes and found that the elastic strain energy plays a significant role in controlling the microstructure of these arrays.
