tldr: 'This article describes a successful empyema operation performed by Mr. Joseph Warner at Guy's Hospital. Empyema is a condition where pus collects in the chest cavity, causing pain, cough, and difficulty breathing. The patient, Thomas Hines, experienced these symptoms and was advised to undergo surgery. Warner made an incision between the tenth and eleventh ribs and removed about twenty ounces of pus. The patient recovered well, and his fever and cough gradually subsided. This case study highlights the importance of proper surgical intervention in treating empyema.'
