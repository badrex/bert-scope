tldr: The authors discovered iron-rich octahedral crystals in the gut caeca cells of the amphipod Stegocephaloides christianiensis. These crystals, identified as ferritin, are expelled in the feces, suggesting a role in iron excretion and body content regulation. The study also investigates the iron content in various inshore Amphipoda species and the morphology of the mouthparts of S. christianiensis, revealing a possible connection between cnidarian consumption and iron regulation.
