revised_title: 'Synaptic Limitations and Contrast Coding in the Blowfly Retina'
semantic_tags:
  - Retinal coding
  - Synaptic transmission
  - Visual processing
  - Neural coding
  - Blowfly
tldr: 'The authors investigate the effects of synaptic transmission on early visual processing in the retina of the blowfly, focusing on the roles of the characteristic curve, synaptic dynamics, and noise. They find that synaptic noise restricts the accuracy of contrast coding under daylight conditions, and that processes of synaptic amplification and retinal antagonism help protect receptor signals from contamination by intrinsic noise.'
