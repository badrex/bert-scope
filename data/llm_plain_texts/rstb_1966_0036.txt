tldr: This article discusses two examples of ritualization and mimicry in animal behavior, specifically in tropical fishes. The first example is the relationship between the wrasse Labroides dimidiatus and the blenny Aspidontus taeniatus, where the latter mimics the former to deceive other fish into thinking it is a cleaner fish. The second example is the use of egg-dummies by male cichlids to attract females and ensure fertilization of their eggs. These examples demonstrate the role of mimicry and ritualization in the evolution of animal communication and behavior.
