tldr: The author analyzes the central differential equation in Einstein's relativity theory of gravitation and finds that it can be integrated exactly using elliptic functions. The results are applied to the solar system, showing that the perihelion of a moving body advances a fraction of a revolution equal to'during each revolution.
