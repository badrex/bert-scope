tldr: The author explains the interferential method for color photography, which uses interference to create color images. The process involves using a transparent film with a reflective layer, allowing light to reflect back and create a set of standing waves. This results in a continuous grating that reflects the specific light rays, producing colors through interference. The author demonstrates the technique with various photographs of natural objects, landscapes, and a portrait.
