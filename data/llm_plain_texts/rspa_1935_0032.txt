tldr: The authors developed a radial-motion expansion cloud-chamber and a falling cloud-chamber to study particle tracks and improve cloud-chamber technology. The radial-motion cloud-chamber provided a uniform two-dimensional expansion, reducing track distortion, while the falling cloud-chamber eliminated the effects of gravity and convection currents. These advancements allowed for clearer and more accurate track photography in particle physics experiments.
