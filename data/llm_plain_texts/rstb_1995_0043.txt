tldr: The article discusses the concept of protein folding and the role of kinetic and equilibrium folding intermediates, such as the molten globule state and the pre-molten globule state. It explains how these intermediates are involved in protein folding and unfolding processes, and how they can be studied using techniques like hydrogen exchange and site-specific mutagenesis. The article also highlights the importance of understanding these intermediates in the context of protein function and physiological processes.
