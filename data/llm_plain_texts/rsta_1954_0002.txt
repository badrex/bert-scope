tldr: The authors investigate the storm surge of 31 January and 1 February 1953 in the North Sea, analyzing the meteorological conditions and the impact on sea levels. They find that strong northerly winds were the main cause of the disturbance, and discuss the effects of geostrophic forces, air-sea friction, and the partial transmission of the surge through the Straits of Dover. The study provides insights into predicting future storm surges and improving surge prediction formulas.
