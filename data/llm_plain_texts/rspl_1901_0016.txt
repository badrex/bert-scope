revised_title: 'Investigation of Gas Pressure and Bessemer Flame Spectra'
semantic_tags:
  - Gas pressure
  - Bessemer process
  - Flame spectroscopy
  - Spectral lines
  - Alkali metals
tldr: 'The author presents a new manometer capable of measuring small pressures with high accuracy. They investigate the behavior of nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen gases using this instrument and confirm the applicability of Boyle's law. Additionally, they study the spectra of Bessemer flames, identifying new spectral lines and elements such as rubidium, cesium, calcium, copper, silver, and gallium.'
