tldr: The authors studied the impact of oxygen on the thermoluminescence of irradiated polyethylene. They discovered that oxygen significantly affects the glow curve, altering the peaks and adding a new peak at a lower temperature. The oxygen effect can be removed by pumping or a pre-irradiation followed by pre-heating, which converts oxygen to peroxide radicals. The thermoluminescence phenomena in polyethylene can be explained by a model involving the trapping of electrons followed by their recombination with different types of luminescence centers.
