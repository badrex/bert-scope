tldr: The author, Dionysius Lardner, challenges the assumption that compressing aqueous vapor would restore a portion of it to the liquid state. He argues that this idea contradicts the doctrine of latent heat and the results of experiments showing that the amount of heat needed to convert water into steam remains constant under all pressures. Lardner suggests that compression only evolves heat and raises the temperature, while expansion absorbs heat and lowers it. The restoration of vapor to the liquid form is due to the abstraction of heat, regardless of the state of density. He also considers permanent gases as vapors containing a large amount of redundant heat.
