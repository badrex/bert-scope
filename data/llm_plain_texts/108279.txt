tldr: The author, Thomas H. Henry, investigates the compounds formed between tin and iodine. He discovers that the previously known compound is a mixture of two salts, one of which is soluble in water without decomposition, while the other is immediately decomposed on contact with water. The author also describes the formation of a new compound, the biniodide of tin, and its properties.
