tldr: This study investigates the aggregation of nitrogen atoms in diamonds and the kinetics of this process. By heating synthetic diamonds under various temperatures and pressures, the researchers were able to reproduce the different types of nitrogen aggregates found in natural diamonds. The information gathered was used to estimate the time that diamonds spent in the Earth's Upper Mantle before being ejected to the surface, providing insights into the formation of these precious stones.
