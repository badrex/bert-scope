semantic_tags:
  - Plate Tectonics

  - Tectonic Stress
  - Oceanic Lithosphere
  - Intraplate Stress Field
tldr: This article explores the dynamics of the lithosphere and the intraplate stress field, focusing on oceanic lithosphere. The authors outline their numerical studies to understand the relationship between dynamics and stress field, considering forces such as ridge push and slab pull. They present new modeling results for the Pacific plate, illustrating the approach and discussing the resistive forces acting on the lithosphere.
