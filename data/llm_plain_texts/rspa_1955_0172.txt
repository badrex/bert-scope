tldr: The author integrates the boundary-layer equations for a plane in compressible flow with heat transfer, providing semi-convergent expressions for temperature and velocity distributions in the boundary layer, drag coefficient, and their dependence on physical constants. The results agree closely with Crocco's numerical computations for certain temperature conditions.
