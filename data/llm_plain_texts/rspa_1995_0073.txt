tldr: This article examines the radiation of sound from a finite fluid-loaded cylindrical elastic shell using the modified Wiener-Hopf technique. The shell is submerged in an inviscid compressible fluid and excited by a ring force. The problem is formulated as a three-part Wiener-Hopf equation, which is then reduced to two uncoupled Fredholm integral equations. Asymptotic analysis is applied to the equations, resulting in a finite system of algebraic equations. Numerical results are presented for the radiated far-field velocity potential.
