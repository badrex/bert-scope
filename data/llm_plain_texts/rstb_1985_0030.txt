revised_title: Multiple Opioid Ligands and Receptors in Nociception
semantic_tags:
  - Opioid receptors
  - Nociception
  - Endogenous opioid peptides
  - Pain management
  - Antinociception
tldr: This article discusses the role of endogenous opioid peptides and opioid receptors in nociception. It summarizes the complexity of opioid systems, including multiple opioid peptide families and receptor types. The study also explores the receptor selectivities of the three opioid peptide families and their involvement in analgesia, particularly focusing on supraspinal receptors.
