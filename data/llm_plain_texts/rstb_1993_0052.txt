tldr: 'This study investigates the hybridization of Darwin's finches on Isla Daphne Major in the Galapagos. Researchers found that hybridization occurs among the finch species, with G. fuliginosa having the highest percentage of hybrid individuals. Hybridization contributes to the large morphological variation among finch populations and raises questions about how species should be defined and recognized. The findings demonstrate that hybridization plays a role in the evolution of Darwin's finches.'
