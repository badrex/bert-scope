tldr: The authors studied the relationship between rainfall and pressure changes in Britain and their impact on the flow of the River Thames. They analyzed data from 1883 to 1903, finding that the river's response to rainfall has a "lag" of about five months. The study also discusses the effects of dredging and water abstraction on the river's flow.
