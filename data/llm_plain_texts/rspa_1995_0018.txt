tldr: The authors apply the Brussels formalism of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and resonance theory to the pastry-cook's transformation, a discrete-time dynamical system. They demonstrate that the subdynamics formalism provides the same description of the long-time behavior of ensembles as the canonical non-equilibrium ensemble, and that the decay rates of the eigenvectors of the evolution operator are the same as those given by the resonance theory.
