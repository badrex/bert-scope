tldr: The authors investigate the rotational energy levels of a diatomic molecule in a tetrahedral field, using Devonshire's method. They find that the tetrahedral field partially removes the degeneracy of the energy levels and splits them into different types. The authors also provide methods for solving the Schrödinger equation for the diatomic molecule, considering both large and small field strengths.
