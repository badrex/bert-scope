tldr: The author presents a method to detect dissolved chemical compounds and their combining proportions using the "voltaic balance." This method is based on the principle that when substances chemically combine, they lose some of their power to excite a voltaic couple. The author demonstrates the method's effectiveness by examining over 180 different mixtures of electrolytic substances and concludes that every electrolytic substance, when dissolved in water, unites chemically in definite proportions with other substances.
