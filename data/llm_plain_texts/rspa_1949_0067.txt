tldr: The authors investigated the constitution of aluminium-rich aluminium-cobalt-copper alloys and the role of transitional metals in their formation. They discovered a ternary compound that enters into equilibrium with the primary solid solution and established isothermal sections of the ternary model at 530°C and 500°C. Their findings support the hypothesis that transitional metal atoms absorb electrons in aluminium-rich alloys and that the occurrence of ternary compounds is influenced by the electron-to-atom ratio.
