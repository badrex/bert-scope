tldr: The author, John Brinkley, conducted observations on the parallax of certain fixed stars, focusing on a Lyre, a Aquilae, and ac Cygni. He found apparent motions in these stars that could be explained by parallax. Although the observations were not very uniform, they were consistent with his previous findings. Brinkley expressed doubts about the fitness of the Greenwich mural circle instrument for such delicate inquiries due to uncertainties in the elements used in computing the index error. However, he believed that the observations made at Greenwich did not conclusively prove the existence or non-existence of parallax.
