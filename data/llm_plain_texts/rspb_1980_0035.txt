tldr: This study investigates the specificity of neonatal tolerance in animals exposed to H-2 alloantigens. The results show that animals can reject skin grafts from unrelated third-party donors, indicating that the tolerance achieved is of the classical type. The study also reveals that the expression of the tolerated Class I antigen on test grafts influences the immunogenicity of associated weak alloantigens, leading to vigorous rejection responses.
