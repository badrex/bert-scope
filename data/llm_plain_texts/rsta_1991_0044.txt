tldr: This article explores the role of fluids in accretionary wedge tectonics using geophysical evidence. Seismic-reflection techniques help define the structure and physical properties of accretionary wedges, providing information on fluid-flow regimes. The position of the decollement horizon influences where porewater is expelled from the sediment by compaction. Fluid escape occurs along thrust faults, fractures, and other structures within the wedge. The measurement of heat flow can detect the outflow of fluids and map its variation in relation to structure and lithology. Seismic velocity variations are used to estimate changes in porosity caused by compaction of sediments, which can be used to derive fluid outflow and fluid pressure.
