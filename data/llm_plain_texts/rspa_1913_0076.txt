tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the thermal effects of heating and cooling palladium in hydrogen. They found that palladium undergoes an allotropic change and that the occlusion of hydrogen by palladium is accompanied by an evolution of heat. The study of heating and cooling curves of hydrogen-palladium provides valuable data for understanding the properties of metal hydrides and the behavior of hydrogen in metals.
