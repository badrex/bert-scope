tldr: The study investigates the genetic population structure of the parthenogenetic snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum in Denmark using PCR-RAPD fingerprints. The researchers found two genotypes in six populations examined, and they were morphologically and genetically indistinguishable from British P. antipodarum. This suggests that the snail successfully invaded Europe by the proliferation of a few clones.
