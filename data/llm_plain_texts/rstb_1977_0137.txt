tldr: This article discusses the potential for new nitrogen fixation processes to improve agricultural yield and efficiency. It explores various reactions involving dinitrogen and transition metal complexes, which could lead to the development of new ammonia production methods. The authors highlight the significance of dinitrogen complexes of molybdenum and tungsten, as well as the possibility of creating an electrode that can pick up dinitrogen and convert it to ammonia in a protic electrolyte, potentially reducing energy consumption in ammonia production.
