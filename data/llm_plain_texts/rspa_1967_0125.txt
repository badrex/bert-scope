tldr: This article discusses the resonant interactions among waves in dispersive fluid systems, focusing on surface gravity waves. The author presents theoretical and experimental studies on these interactions, comparing two sets of experiments and demonstrating the primary wave's instability to disturbances containing wavenumber pairs. The findings show the growth of the third wave component, the linear rate of growth with interaction distance, and the decrease in the response function's bandwidth as the interaction distance increases.
