tldr: The authors confirmed the existence of a direct projection from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) to the prestriate cortex in macaque monkeys. They found that labeled cells were distributed in all layers of the LGN and that this projection had lower retinotopic precision compared to the projection to area 17. This discovery challenges the previously accepted concept of hierarchical processing of visual information in primates.
