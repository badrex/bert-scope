tldr: The author, T. E. Thorpe, describes the synthesis of phosphorus pentafluoride (PF5) and its properties. PF5 is a colorless, incombustible gas that is absolutely irrespirable and rapidly decomposed by water. It is nearly three times heavier than air and can be collected by downward displacement. The gas experiences no apparent change on the passage of induction-sparks and is readily absorbed by an aqueous solution of ammonia. The existence of gaseous PF5, which is perfectly stable even at high temperatures, is of great theoretical interest as it unequivocally indicates the pentadicity of phosphorus.
