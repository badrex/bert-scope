revised_title: 'Independent Release of Vasopressin and Oxytocin in Response to Hemorrhage'
semantic_tags:
  - Hormone release
  - Vasopressin
  - Oxytocin
  - Hemorrhage
  - Blood pressure regulation
tldr: The authors conducted experiments on anaesthetized cats to study the release of vasopressin and oxytocin in response to hemorrhage. They found that hemorrhage caused the release of vasopressin without detectable amounts of oxytocin. This suggests that the two hormones can be released independently, challenging the widely accepted view that they are always released together from the neurohypophysis.
