tldr: The study investigates the function of the corpus callosum in the Siamese cat and concludes that it generates binocular neurons and mediates interocular interactions in the Clare-Bishop area. The research also shows that sectioning the corpus callosum significantly affects the binocularity of neurons in Siamese cats, while having no change in normal cats.
