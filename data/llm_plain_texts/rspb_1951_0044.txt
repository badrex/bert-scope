tldr: The author investigates the learning process in Octopus, discovering that the nervous system changes rapidly in response to stimuli. They found that Octopus can learn to associate a food item with a painful stimulus, demonstrating the plasticity of their nervous system. This research provides insights into the growth and plasticity of the nervous system and the potential for studying learning processes in other animals.
