tldr: This study investigates the conjoint spatiotemporal tuning function of motion-sensitive mechanisms in the human visual system. Researchers found that these mechanisms have bandpass tuning in both space and time, allowing them to analyze both the form and motion of moving objects. The results explain various perceptual phenomena, including summation, motion smear reduction, metacontrast, stroboscopic motion, and spatiotemporal interpolation.
