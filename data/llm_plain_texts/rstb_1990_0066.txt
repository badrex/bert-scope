tldr: This study investigates the use of cladoceran analysis in detecting changes in predation, pH, vegetation, and other historic events in acid and acidified lakes. The researchers analyzed surface sediment samples from 18 lakes and sediment cores from nine lakes in Norway, Scotland, and Sweden. The results show that cladoceran remains can be used to infer past lake conditions, including changes in fish populations, pH levels, and vegetation distribution.
