tldr: The authors analyze the Sal'nikov thermokinetic oscillator, a chemical kinetic model, using advanced mathematical techniques. They discover various regions in the parameter space where the system displays different behaviors, including multiple limit cycles and unstable steady states. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the model's qualitatively distinct behaviors and contributes to the field of chemical kinetics and thermodynamics.
