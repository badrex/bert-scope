semantic_tags:
  - Diffraction

tldr: 'The author investigates the diffraction of light by spheres with a small relative index, providing mathematical formulas for the electric displacements in the scattered wave. The study focuses on the intensity of the secondary disturbance and its relation to the angle between the secondary ray and the axis of the sphere. The author also discusses the implications of these findings on the transmission of light through suspensions containing particles.'
