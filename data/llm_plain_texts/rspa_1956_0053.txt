tldr: This study investigates the recombination of oxygen atoms on various salt and oxide surfaces, including potassium chloride, lithium chloride, lead monoxide, and molybdenum trioxide. The researchers found that the process occurring at potassium and lithium chloride surfaces is first order, and their activity increases with temperature. The efficiency of oxygen atom removal at these surfaces is discussed, and the effect of temperature on the activity of a molybdenum oxide surface remains uncertain.
