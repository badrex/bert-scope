tldr: The author discovered the first gene on the avian W chromosome, called CHD, which can be used as a universal tag for sexing non-ratite birds. This gene encodes a chromo-helicase-DNA binding protein and is highly conserved, making it useful for determining sex in various bird species. This discovery opens up possibilities for further research in evolutionary genetics and bird biology.
