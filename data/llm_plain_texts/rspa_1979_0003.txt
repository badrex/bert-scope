semantic_tags:
  - Large Numbers Hypothesis

tldr: The author explores the Large Numbers Hypothesis and its implications for the Einstein theory of gravitation. They propose a new model of the universe, the E.S. model, which reconciles the hypothesis with the theory. The author also discusses the cosmic expansion, the modified Schwarzschild metric, and the cosmic microwave background radiation as evidence supporting this model.
