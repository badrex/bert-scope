tldr: The study examines the structure and connections of the mushroom bodies in honeybees, which play a crucial role in their memory and learning processes. The researchers found that the mushroom bodies consist of the calyx, pedunculus, and two lobes, and are formed by the arborizations of thousands of Kenyon cells. The organization of the calyx is transformed into a Cartesian map within the pedunculus and lobes, which process second-order antennal and fourth-and higher-order visual information. The feedback pathways in the mushroom bodies may be important in complex timing processes and the formation of short-term memory.
