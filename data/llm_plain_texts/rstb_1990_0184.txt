tldr: The Erosion-Productivity Impact Calculator (EPIC) model is a mathematical model that assesses the effects of soil erosion on soil productivity. It has been applied to various agricultural management problems, including drought assessment, soil loss tolerance tools, and farm-level planning. The model simulates erosion, plant growth, and related processes, as well as economic aspects of managing erosion and determining optimal management strategies.
