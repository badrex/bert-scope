tldr: The authors conducted a study on the infrared spectrum and molecular structure of sulphur trioxide. They analyzed the rotational fine structure of several bands and made a more convincing assignment of molecular vibration frequencies. The study provided a more accurate bond length and explained some vibrational-rotational interactions affecting the appearance of bands. The research used improved methods and higher resolving power to measure the rotational structure of multiple bands, leading to a better understanding of the molecule's properties.
