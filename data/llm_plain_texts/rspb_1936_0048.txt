revised_title: 'The Growth of Embryo Bones Transplanted in Rat Brains'

  - Cartilage differentiation
tldr: Researchers discovered that when they transplant early cartilaginous bone primordia from rat embryos into the brains of young host rats, the bones can grow into fully formed long bones. This shows that the growth and differentiation capabilities of long bones are inherent in their cartilaginous primordia and not dependent on their surroundings.
