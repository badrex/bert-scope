tldr: The author presents a method for calculating two-dimensional steady inviscid supersonic flow fields with heat addition, using an inverse approach that determines the distribution of heat necessary to satisfy the Euler equations. This method is particularly useful for analyzing hypersonic aircraft and can be adapted to satisfy the Euler equations for a given mode of heat addition.
