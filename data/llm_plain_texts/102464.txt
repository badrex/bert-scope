tldr: In a letter to Dr. Lister, Edward Lhwyd describes a fiery exhalation in Merionydh-Shire, which causes the death of various animals. The exhalation originates from a place called Morva bychan in Caernarvonshire and occurs mostly during the summer. It can be repelled by loud noises, such as horns or drums, saving buildings and hay stacks from damage.
