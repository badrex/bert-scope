tldr: This paper presents a theoretical analysis of sound pulse diffraction by a semi-infinite plane. The authors use parabolic coordinates and Fourier transforms to derive mathematical solutions for the pressure changes in the shadow and near the boundary of the geometrical shadow. The study provides insights into the propagation of sound pulses and has implications for understanding sound behavior in real-world scenarios.
