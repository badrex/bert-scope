tldr: 'This study investigates the effects of opioid peptide agonists selective for different receptors on identified dorsal horn neurons and their role in nociception. The intrathecal infusion of these agonists reduces behavioral responses to noxious thermal stimuli. The dynorphin, a selective ligand for the K receptor, and other opioid receptor-selective compounds were tested on single identified dorsal horn neurons. The results suggest that the K receptor is involved in the selective antinociceptive effect of dynorphin on ascending somatosensory neurons. The effect of dynorphin was antagonized by naloxone and RX 781094, suggesting a novel mechanism for the mediation of segmental antinociceptive effects through activation of the terminals of descending tracts.'
