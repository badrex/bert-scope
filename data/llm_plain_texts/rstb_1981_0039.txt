tldr: This article discusses the achievements and limitations of conventional plant breeding in improving crop yields, resistance to environmental hazards, and product quality. It highlights the importance of varietal improvements in increasing harvest index and the need for further research in increasing total biomass and photosynthesis rates to enhance crop yields. The article also emphasizes the challenges faced in breeding for resistance to pathogens and the need for more efficient use of genetic resources.
