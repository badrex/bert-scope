tldr: The study investigates the effect of denervation on the longitudinal growth of a voluntary muscle in rabbits. The results show that both permanent and temporary denervation lead to diminished muscle growth, with the extent of growth reduction depending on the duration of denervation and the extent of reinnervation. The study also examines the functional capacity of muscles that became reinnervated and the impact of denervation on the site of longitudinal growth.
