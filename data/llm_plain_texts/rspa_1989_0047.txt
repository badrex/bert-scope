tldr: The authors study electrodeposition in support of concentration gradients, an ohmic model, and the genesis of branching fractals. They use paper-supported copper electrodeposition to create well-presented fractal and dense radial structures. Measurements of current and length scale against time fit an ohmic model of the growth conditions. The interface between the growths is a distinctive compact granular deposit, which is unstable to branching and dendrite growth.
