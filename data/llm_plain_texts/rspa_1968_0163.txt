tldr: This article examines the field equations in the neighborhood of a particle in a conformal theory of gravitation. The author investigates a spherically symmetric metric and shows that the only solution satisfying all boundary conditions is the special solution obtained by setting a specific constant to zero. The significance of this result is discussed, emphasizing the uniqueness of the solution and its implications for the relationship between the gravitational constant, inertial mass, and inertia contributed by the particle.
