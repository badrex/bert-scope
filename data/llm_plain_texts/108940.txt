tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the influence of color and mechanical condition on radiant heat absorption. They discovered that the chemical composition of a substance plays a significant role in its ability to absorb and radiate heat, contrary to previous assumptions that physical condition was the main factor. The author also found that certain substances, like iodine, are more diathermic and less warmed by radiant heat due to their internal reflection properties.
