tldr: The author examines the relationship between the index of refraction and the length of waves for various substances, using Cauchy's theory of undulations. The results show that the refractive indices observed for each of the seven definite rays are related to the length of waves as nearly as possible according to the formula deduced from Cauchy's theory.
