tldr: This article discusses the use of MST-VHF radar technology to study small-scale and meso-scale phenomena in the middle atmosphere, such as turbulence, waves, and winds. The radar technique allows for the detection and analysis of atmospheric parameters like humidity, temperature, and electron density, providing valuable insights into the dynamics of the middle atmosphere. The study focuses on gravity-wave and turbulence sources, their upward propagation, and the transport of energy and momentum. The article also explores the generation mechanisms of turbulence and its coexistence with stable stratifications, offering a better understanding of the interaction of meso-scale and small-scale phenomena in the middle atmosphere.
