tldr: The authors studied the distribution of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in synthetic triglycerides created by esterifying mixtures of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids with glycerol. They compared the structure of these synthetic triglycerides to natural fats and found that the distribution of fatty acids in vegetable seed fats tends to be even, while pericarp fats and animal fats have a more heterogeneous structure. The results showed that the proportion of fully-saturated glycerides in synthetic fats is determined by the molecular percentage of saturated acids present.
