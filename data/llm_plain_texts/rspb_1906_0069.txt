tldr: The authors discuss myelins, myelin bodies, and their properties, including their ability to swell in water and exhibit irregular forms. They also describe the discovery of double refraction in myelin bodies, which led to the investigation of fluid spherocrystals. These fluid crystals are substances that can pass from a solid state to a fluid state, maintaining their crystalline features under polarized light. The authors identify several substances, such as esters and oleic acid groups, that exhibit these properties and contribute to the understanding of myelin bodies in organisms.
