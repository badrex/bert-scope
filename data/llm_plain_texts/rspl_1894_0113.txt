tldr: The authors studied the absorption spectra of dilute solutions and the molecular condition of salts in solution. They used a new spectrophotometer to measure the extinction coefficients of various solutions and found that the difference in light absorption between cupric acetate and other salts is due to incomplete electrolytic dissociation. The authors also investigated the hydrolytic decomposition of ferric chloride in aqueous solutions and compared the results with the law of Guldberg and Waage and the modified form due to Arrhenius.
