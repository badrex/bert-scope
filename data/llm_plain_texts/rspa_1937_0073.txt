semantic_tags:
  - Metallic hydrogen
  - Alloy formation
  - Transition metals
  - Band theory of metals
  - Lattice expansion
tldr: The author investigates the properties of metallic hydrogen and its alloys, focusing on the solubility of hydrogen in various metals and the effects of lattice expansion on the energy states of transition metals. The study also explores the formation of two phases in palladium hydrogen alloys and the hysteresis phenomena observed in these materials.
