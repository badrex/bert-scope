tldr: This article investigates the influence of temperature, water vapor, and drying on the conductivity of salt vapors. The author finds that water vapor has a significant impact on the current passing in salt vapors, and that drying the salt can lead to a more constant current. The research also explores the influence of temperature on the conductivity produced by heated salts.
