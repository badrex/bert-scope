tldr: The authors studied the behavior of a-brass during plastic deformation and annealing. They discovered that the deformation and annealing behavior of a-brass is different from that of pure metals due to its low stacking-fault energy. The results showed that the stored energy, resistivity, density, and hardness changes during the annealing process are influenced by order, point defects, dislocations, and their associated stacking faults.
