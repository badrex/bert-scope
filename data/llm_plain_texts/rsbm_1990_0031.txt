Born in 1901, Hinton began his career as an apprentice engineer before attending Trinity College, Cambridge, where he excelled in engineering and mathematics. He then worked for Brunner Mond, which later became part of Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI), where he rose to the position of Deputy Chief Engineer at a young age. Hinton played a crucial role in the development of the chemical industry, including the design and construction of synthetic ammonia plants and the optimization of manufacturing methods.
