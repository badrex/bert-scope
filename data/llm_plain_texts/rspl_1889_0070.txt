tldr: The author conducted experiments on spark discharge and observed the formation of dust-figures using lycopodium powder on a glass plate. They described various patterns and their characteristics, and discussed the effects of different gases and atmospheric conditions on the formation of these figures. The study provides insights into the behavior of electrical discharges and their interactions with different materials.
