tldr: The authors discuss the reconstruction of rock cooling paths using kinetic data on the Fe-Mg exchange reaction in anthophyllite. They describe the intracrystalline exchange reaction process and its application to anthophyllite, providing a model to estimate rock cooling rates. This research helps in understanding the temperature-time history of rocks and the evolution of geosynclines.
