tldr: The article presents exact solutions for the electron distribution in plane magnetrons with a parabolic potential that has a minimum. The study focuses on electron space charge and tangential current density distributions in crossed electric and magnetic fields. The research covers both medium and low magnetic fields and provides a better understanding of the electron distribution in magnetrons, which can help improve their performance.
