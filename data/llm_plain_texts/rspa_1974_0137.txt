tldr: The authors report new structure in the absorption spectrum of Zn I vapor between 70 and 105 Ã…, due to the excitation of the 3s2 subshell. They interpret the structure as a Rydberg series and compare their findings with semi-empirical and Hartree-Fock predictions. The study provides insights into the atomic structure and electronic transitions of zinc atoms.
