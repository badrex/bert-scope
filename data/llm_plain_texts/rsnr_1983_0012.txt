tldr: This article discusses the work of Frederick Hughes Scott, who made significant contributions to the early history of neurobiology. Scott proposed that nerve cells secrete a substance that passes through nerve endings to stimulate other cells, a concept that aligns with modern understanding of neurotransmitters. His ideas, however, were not widely recognized during his time, and he did not pursue further research in this area.
