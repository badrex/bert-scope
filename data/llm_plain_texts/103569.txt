tldr: The author conducted experiments using bile from individuals who died of the plague in Marseilles. They injected the bile into dogs and observed symptoms similar to the plague, including buboes, carbuncles, and gangrenous inflammations. The results suggest that the plague can be transmitted through contact with infected bodily fluids, such as bile.
