tldr: The authors study the spectrum of hydrogen molecules (H2) and discover that the bands in the spectrum are analogous to the parhelium line spectrum. They analyze the rotational and vibrational energy levels, finding that the alternating intensity of the bands follows a 3 to 1 weight ratio. The authors also discuss the properties of different hydrogen molecule band systems and their unique features.
