tldr: This article discusses the concept of grand unified theories (GUTs) in cosmology and their potential applications. It explores how GUTs can explain the baryon-antibaryon asymmetry in the universe and the possibility of neutrinos having large enough masses to influence galaxy formation. The article also touches upon the unification of weak and electromagnetic interactions and the development of coupling strengths in GUTs.
