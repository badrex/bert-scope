tldr: The authors provide an error estimate for the fast multipole method in the two-dimensional case, which is essential for optimizing the algorithm's efficiency. They analyze the error in calculating the total electrostatic energy and forces due to particles, allowing for better performance comparisons with other methods at the same relative error.
