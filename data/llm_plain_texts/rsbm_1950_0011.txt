tldr: George Hugh Henderson was a physicist known for his work on alpha-particles and their effects, particularly in the study of pleochroic haloes in mica. He also researched the distribution of radioactive deposits in an electric field and the capture and loss of electrons by alpha-particles passing through matter. Besides his contributions to physics, Henderson was an art enthusiast, collecting etchings and original paintings throughout his life.
