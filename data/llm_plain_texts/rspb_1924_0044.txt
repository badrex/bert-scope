tldr: The authors conducted a study on the spectra of various hemoglobins from different vertebrates and found a relationship between the spectra and their relative affinities for oxygen and carbon monoxide. They developed a curve that can be used to predict the affinity of hemoglobin for these gases based on the position of the -band in the spectrum. This research helps to understand the differences in hemoglobin properties among species and individuals.
