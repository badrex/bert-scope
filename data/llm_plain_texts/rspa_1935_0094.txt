revised_title: 'New Field Theory and Commuting Co-ordinates'
semantic_tags:
  - Quantum Mechanics
  - Field Theory
  - Angular Momentum
  - Relativity
  - Commutation Rules
tldr: The authors introduce new concepts in the field theory, specifically the co-ordinates and inner angular momentum, which obey the commutation rules. These concepts are related to quantum mechanics and relativity, and they provide a deeper understanding of the behavior of particles in a closed electrodynamical system.
