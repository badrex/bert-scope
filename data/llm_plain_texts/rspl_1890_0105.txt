tldr: The author investigates the role of oxygen in the formation of ptomaines, toxic substances produced by bacteria during the process of putrefaction. The study shows that a free supply of oxygen prevents the formation of ptomaines, while their absence leads to the greatest formation. The results support Pasteur's views on the relationship between fermentation processes and the absence of oxygen.
