tldr: 'Stephen Gray conducted experiments to study the effects of electrical attraction on animal and inanimate bodies. He discovered that certain materials, like metals, could conduct electricity and produce light when rubbed with an electrified tube. Gray also observed that animals, even when dead, could conduct electricity and produce light when touched with metal rods. These findings expanded the understanding of electricity and its relationship with light.'
