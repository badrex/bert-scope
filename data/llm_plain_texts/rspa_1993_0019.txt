tldr: The authors develop a theory for the dynamics of interfaces in two-phase elastic solids driven by mass transport and stress. They consider a system of bulk regions separated by a sharp interface with energy and capable of supporting force. The theory is based on balance laws for mass and force, and it provides a constitutive theory for the interface. The field equations are developed in terms of the diffusion potential and its time derivatives, leading to a hierarchy of variational principles that describe the equilibrium shapes of misfitting particles and possible microstructures.
