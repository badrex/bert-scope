tldr: This article investigates the capsizability of model ships in a wave tank by studying their response to naturally propagating wavefronts created by a suddenly switched-on wave maker. The study focuses on the worst encounter frequency that induces the most severe beam-sea resonance. The results show that a symmetrical vessel can lose up to 30% of its sustainable wave slope under realistic wind loading, emphasizing the importance of considering both transient wave excitation and lateral wind loading in ship design.
