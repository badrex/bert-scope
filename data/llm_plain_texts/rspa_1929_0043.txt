tldr: The authors conducted experiments with bromine and chlorine in various states, including gas, aqueous solutions, and carbon tetrachloride solutions. They found that when mixed, the two halogens form a compound called bromine chloride. In equimolecular mixtures, about 50% of the halogens are present as the compound. The formation of this compound is supported by the appearance of a new ultraviolet absorption band and the time it takes for the color change to occur in carbon tetrachloride solutions.
