tldr: The article presents a manifestly gauge invariant relativistic quantum field theory for the interaction of atomic systems with electromagnetic fields. The theory involves an exact decomposition of the Dirac sources into polarization sources, which couple directly to the field intensities, providing a clear separation between electric and magnetic interactions. This approach avoids the complications of conventional quantum electrodynamics and offers potential applications to various atomic and molecular systems.
