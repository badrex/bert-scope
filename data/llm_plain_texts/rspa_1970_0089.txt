tldr: The article explores the enumeration of vertex-regular compound honeycombs in hyperbolic space, focusing on regular honeycombs with specific vertex figures. It provides a method for calculating the diagonal-lengths of these honeycombs and discusses the conditions for the existence of vertex-regular compounds. Two distinct vertex-regular compound honeycombs in hyperbolic three-space are identified.
