tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine if shielding iron from the Earth's magnetism was necessary to achieve high permeability. They found that high maximum permeability could be obtained without shielding when the iron was subjected to a magnetizing force and cooled through the temperature at which it regains magnetic properties.
