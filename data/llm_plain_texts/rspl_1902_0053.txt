tldr: This article investigates the relationship between solar activity, specifically solar prominences and sunspots, and short-term changes in atmospheric pressure. The authors find that the variations in pressure over the Indian area and other regions are influenced by extra-terrestrial factors, with solar activity being a significant contributor. They also discover that the short-period variations in pressure are closely related to the outbursts of solar prominences and changes in the latitude of sunspots, suggesting that these events affect the Earth's atmospheric pressure and circulation.
