tldr: This study investigates the effects of oestrin on the uterus of bitches, focusing on the changes it causes in the vulva, vagina, uterine muscle, and endometrium, as well as the influence of the pituitary gland. The results show that oestrin can induce uterine bleeding in both ovariectomized and hypophysectomized bitches, suggesting that the hormone's action is independent of the pituitary gland.
