tldr: This study examines the various soil types and nutrient distribution on Signy Island in the Antarctic ecosystem. The authors discuss the influence of soil-forming factors on the chemistry of the island's soils, including the parent rock, weathering, and the role of microorganisms. They also analyze the impact of vegetation and animal life on nutrient availability and distribution. The study concludes that soil-forming processes exist and relatively mature soils can develop under favorable conditions, with nutrient supply well in excess of the requirements of the island's flora and fauna.
