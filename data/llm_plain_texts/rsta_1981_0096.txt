tldr: The authors surveyed available experimental data on the turbulent burning velocity of premixed gases and discussed the accuracy of experimental measurements and relevant turbulent parameters. They developed a two-eddy theory of burning and compared theoretical predictions with experimentally measured values. This theory is applicable at higher levels of turbulence and is an extension of the authors' previous two-eddy theory.
