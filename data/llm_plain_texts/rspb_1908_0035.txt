tldr: This study investigates the hereditary transmission of albino and piebald coat patterns in rats. The author found that albino rats can have different coat patterns and that the offspring of piebald black rats can have various combinations of black piebald, albino, and "Irish" forms. The results show that the divergence in offspring is due to the genetic nature of the albino parent.
