tldr: In December 1772, a massive flood caused the Solway Moss in England to burst, resulting in the displacement of 35 families and the destruction of homes and crops. The flood also created a large lake and caused significant land subsidence, with some areas sinking up to 25 feet. This event highlights the devastating effects of natural disasters on the environment and communities.
