tldr: The author, Francis Hauksbee, conducted experiments with a deep red liquid extracted from shell-lac and mixed it with common water. He found that the lac extract did not freeze even in cold weather, and when mixed with water, the water would freeze while the lac extract remained fluid. The author also observed that the lac extract was slightly heavier than water and that its color would change when frozen. He further experimented with a purple dye made from logwood and allom, observing similar freezing behavior.
