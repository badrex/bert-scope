tldr: The author responds to four papers by Mr. Hobs, discussing the concept of infinity and its applications in mathematics and physics. They explore the idea of infinite quantities, infinite divisions, and the possibility of a quantity greater than infinite. The author also addresses the use of infinity in Euclidean geometry and the implications of infinite time in the context of the world's beginning.
