tldr: The article discusses the development of site-directed mutagenesis, a technique that allows scientists to make specific changes in a gene's DNA sequence to study the effects on the resulting protein. The author explains the methods for site-directed mutagenesis, including random point mutations and specific predetermined mutations, and their applications in understanding protein structure and function. The article also highlights the importance of expressing mutated genes in various host cells for analysis.
