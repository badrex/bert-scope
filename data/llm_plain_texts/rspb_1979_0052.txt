tldr: The author discusses the challenges of detecting the risk of cancer from man-made chemicals in the environment. They argue that epidemiology is limited in its ability to recognize carcinogens at low exposure levels and suggest that laboratory studies of high doses on model systems are necessary for a better understanding of the hazards. The author also emphasizes the importance of developing reliable in-vitro models for human carcinogenesis to study the effects of chronic, low-dose exposure to carcinogens.
