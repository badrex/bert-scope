tldr: This study investigates the behavior of chromium additives in premixed H2 + O2 + N2 flames using photometric methods. The results show that chromium additives affect the gas-phase chemistry and cause significant catalysis of radical recombination. The study also examines the solid-phase particles in the flames and their interaction with gaseous chromim-containing constituents.
