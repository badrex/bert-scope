tldr: The authors present a general construction for the solutions of the equations of motion for real classical strings in Minkowskian four-space. They encompass all allowable string configurations, except for a set of measure zero. The trajectory of a classical relativistic string is a two-dimensional world-sheet, and the construction is given in terms of an essentially freely specifiable curve lying in the hypersurface, the space of null twistors.
