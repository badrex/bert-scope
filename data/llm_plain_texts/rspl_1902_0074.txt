tldr: This article discusses the role of gravitational instability in the evolution of planets. The author compares two extreme hypotheses, one based on rotational instability and the other on gravitational instability. The author concludes that the latter hypothesis is more consistent with observations of the solar system, suggesting that gravitational forces play a significant role in planetary evolution.
