tldr: 'A. W. Hofmann discovers a new group of alkaloids connected to the volatile organic bases. These new alkaloids are non-volatile and form a link between artificial and natural alkaloids. The author establishes the conditions for their formation and describes the properties of these substances, including their alkaline reactions, ability to saponify fats, and reactions with metal salts. The research has implications for the artificial production of natural alkaloids, such as those found in cinchona bark.'
