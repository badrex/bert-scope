tldr: This article discusses the ray paths and interference fringe periodicity from a cosmic radio source to a satellite in orbit. The authors analyze the signal strength and phase path along a ray, considering the refractive index and assuming an isotropic aerial. Their findings contribute to understanding radio wave propagation and satellite communication.
