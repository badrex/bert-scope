tldr: This study examines the acidification and atmospheric contamination histories of four lakes in Scotland using palaeolimnological techniques, including diatom analysis. The results show that afforestation of a catchment in a high acid deposition area has increased the rate of lake acidification, while there is no evidence for acidification due to forest growth alone in the area of lower acid deposition.
