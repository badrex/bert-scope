tldr: 'This study investigates microsatellite DNA variation in six European cattle breeds, analyzing 12 microsatellite loci. The research found a wide spectrum of variability, with observed heterozygosities ranging from 0.00 to 0.91. The results provide evidence for marker stability during short-term evolution and indicate that microsatellite markers can be valuable tools for studying genetic relationships among cattle breeds.'
