tldr: The author examines the embryological development of the butterfly species Pieris rapae, focusing on the organogeny and morphological changes from germ layer formation to the differentiation of various systems in the caterpillar. The study highlights the role of body wall development and blastokinesis in the changes of the embryo's position and form during its growth.
