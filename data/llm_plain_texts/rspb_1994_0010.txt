revised_title: 'Dopaminergic Modulation and pH-Gated Regulation of Horizontal Cell Gap Junctions in Mammalian Retina'

tldr: This study shows that the permeability of gap junctions between A-type horizontal cells in the rabbit retina is modulated by dopamine through a Dx receptor linked to adenylate cyclase. The effect is pH-gated, occurring only at an extracellular pH of 7.2. The results suggest that ambient light conditions could gate the activity of neurotransmitters through pH-sensitive mechanisms.
