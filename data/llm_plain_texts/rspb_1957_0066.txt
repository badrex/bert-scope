tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of freezing and thawing rates on the survival of mammalian cells and tissues. They found that rapid freezing and thawing with protective treatments, such as glycerol or ethylene glycol, significantly improved tissue survival. The study also showed that a rapid rate of cooling and rewarming is essential for good recovery of frozen tissues.
