tldr: The article discusses the use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to study metabolism in intact organs, specifically focusing on phosphorus NMR to measure enzyme-catalyzed fluxes between phosphocreatine and ATP in animal hearts and kidneys. The authors describe experiments to investigate energy supply and heart rate in isolated perfused rat hearts, validate the perfusion model, and study ischaemia and metabolism in rabbit kidneys to understand the relation between functional and metabolic recovery after a renal transplant operation.
