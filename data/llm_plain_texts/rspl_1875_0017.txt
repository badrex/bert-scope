tldr: The author examines the placenta of the Hyrax and concludes that it is a deciduate placenta, similar to that of the domestic cat. The placenta has a zonary structure with villi resembling those of the cat, and the maternal and foetal surfaces are closely interlocked. The author also describes the amnion, allantois, and umbilical cord in the Hyrax, as well as the non-placental area of the uterus containing tubular glands.
