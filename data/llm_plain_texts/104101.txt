tldr: A woman suffered from Hydrops Ovarii, a condition where fluid accumulates in the ovaries, and was tapped 57 times over three years. The author, John Belchier, describes the woman's symptoms, medical treatments, and the eventual autopsy findings. He also discusses a possible cause of the condition, which may have been caused by exposure to cold water while the woman was not fully submerged in a bathtub. This case study provides valuable insights into the understanding of ovarian disorders and their potential causes.
