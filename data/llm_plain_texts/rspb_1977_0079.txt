tldr: This study investigates the transport of rat and bovine IgG and ferritin across the small intestine segments of suckling rats. The most active transport occurs in the ileum, with both proteins being taken up by the cells and released into the carcase. The results show that the small intestine of suckling rats is selective in transporting proteins, with the duodenum having a slightly higher selectivity ratio compared to the ileum and jejunum.
