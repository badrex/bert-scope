tldr: The authors conducted an X-ray study of mannitol, dulcitol, and mannose to investigate their crystal structures. They found that both mannitol and dulcitol have simple orthorhombic lattices with four molecules in each unit cell. The molecules are based on a zig-zag carbon chain and have similar dimensions, suggesting a common long-chain configuration. The study also revealed that the crystals' cleavage is due to the interaction of hydroxyl groups, and the (3-angle is determined by the pairing of these groups. This research provides valuable insights into the structure and properties of these sugars.
