tldr: The author investigates the role of muscular mechanism in the functioning of cardiac valves, specifically the auriculo-ventricular valves. They discover that a muscular mechanism, consisting of a sheet of longitudinally coursing fibers, enters the base of the valve flaps and assists in raising the flaps towards the position of closure. This mechanism works in conjunction with eddies and currents to ensure proper valve function and prevent the escape of blood during heart inversion.
