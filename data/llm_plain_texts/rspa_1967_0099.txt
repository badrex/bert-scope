tldr: This article introduces the concept of the Schrodinger supergroup, which consists of two subgroups: symmetry operations for rigid molecules and isodynamic operations for nonrigid molecules. The author demonstrates how these operations can be used to study the electronic energy levels and potential energy surfaces of nonrigid molecules, providing a more accurate understanding of their behavior.
