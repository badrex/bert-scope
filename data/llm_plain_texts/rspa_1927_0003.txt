tldr: The author presents a method to overcome the difficulty of Hilbert's process in the context of electromagnetic field equations and general relativity. They introduce a world-function that generalizes the work of Hilbert, Lorentz, and Weyl, allowing for the existence of magnetic currents and light-pulses in the theory of general relativity. The author derives the differential equations involved in the variational principle, including the field equations of gravitation and the equations of motion for particles carrying electric and magnetic charges.
