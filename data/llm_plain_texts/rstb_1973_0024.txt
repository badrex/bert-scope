tldr: The article discusses the assembly of ribbon-shaped structures in low ionic strength extracts from vertebrate smooth muscle. These ribbons, which can be up to 100 nm wide and several micrometers long, have a strong repeat period of about 5.6 nm. The ribbons are made up of a ribbon-shaped core of non-myosin material, surrounded by a surface lattice of myosin molecules. Tropomyosin, a protein found in large amounts in vertebrate smooth muscle, is proposed to form the core of these ribbons, which may determine the polarity of the attached myosin molecules.
