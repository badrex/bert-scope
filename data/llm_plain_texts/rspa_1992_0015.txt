tldr: This article investigates the power dissipated by solid-state phase changes in the transition layer of the Earth's mantle. It explores the effects of mechanical energy dissipation in the motion required outside the growing grains of new phase by mass conservation. The study estimates the extra dissipation by phase changes and its implications for mantle convection, suggesting that phase changes in the mantle may cause layering and hinder vertical motion.
