tldr: This article investigates the active transport of sulfate and phosphate in the renal proximal tubule. It shows that phosphate transport is Na+-dependent and regulated by parathyroid hormone, while sulfate transport involves electroneutral 2 Na+-SO42- co-transport through the brush-border membrane. The study also explores the influence of pH, diet, and other factors on the transport processes.
