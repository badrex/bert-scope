tldr: This article explores the influence of the layer of transition on metallic reflection, discussing the optical constants of metals and the relationship between the angle of incidence and the intensity of reflected light. The author also examines the differences in reflection for light polarized perpendicularly and parallel to the plane of incidence, and considers the impact of the layer of transition on these phenomena.
