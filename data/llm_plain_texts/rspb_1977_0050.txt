tldr: The study investigates the mechanical properties of mother of pearl, or nacre, in tension. Nacre, found in mollusks, has a tensile strength of between 35 and 110 MN m^-1. It is slightly viscoelastic and shows plastic deformation with optical changes. The work of fracture varies depending on the loading direction. Nacre's ability to stop cracks and its submicroscopic structure are discussed, and the importance of the precise arrangement of its plates is emphasized.
