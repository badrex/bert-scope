tldr: Researchers J. W. Heslop Harrison, F. C. Garrett, and E. W. MacBride conducted experiments to understand the induction and inheritance of melanism in lepidoptera insects. They fed non-melanic insects from unaffected areas on plants contaminated with lead nitrate and manganous sulfate, which are common in industrial areas. The results showed that melanism could be induced and inherited in these insects, suggesting a connection between industrialization and the spread of melanism in lepidoptera populations.
