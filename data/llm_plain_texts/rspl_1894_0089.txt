  - After-images
  - Visual Impressions
  - Recurrent Vision
tldr: This article presents two separate studies. The first study investigates the Newtonian constant of gravitation using an elaborate apparatus with lead balls and an optical compass. The second study, conducted by Shelford Bidwell, explores the phenomenon of recurrent images following visual impressions, such as after-images and optical reflections. The author discusses previous observations and experiments on this topic, including those by Professor C. A. Young and Mr. A. S. Davis.
