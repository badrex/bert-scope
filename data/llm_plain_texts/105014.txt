tldr: In July 1750, a fire-ball was observed in the sky by multiple witnesses, including Mr. Wm. Smith. The fire-ball appeared to be the size of a large star, with a color similar to a rocket. It had a tail of light and moved horizontally at a slow speed. The phenomenon was seen in various locations, suggesting it was at a great height in the atmosphere.
