  - Ring structure
  - Ring observations
tldr: This article reviews the dynamics of planetary rings and their associated satellites based on data from space missions to the outer planets. It highlights the diverse and complex ring systems of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, and discusses the role of small satellites in determining ring structure. The article also emphasizes the importance of the forthcoming Cassini mission for understanding ring dynamics and presents a summary of critical ring observations that can only be made by a spacecraft orbiting Saturn for an extended period.
