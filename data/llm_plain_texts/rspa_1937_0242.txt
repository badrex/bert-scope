tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the photochemical polymerization of methyl methacrylate vapour. They discovered that the reaction is a chain process involving gas-phase polymerization and surface growth. The reaction is initiated by ultra-violet radiation, and the rate of polymerization can be controlled by adjusting gas pressure and temperature. The authors also found that the reaction is not directly dependent on mercury vapour, and the decomposition of the molecule during polymerization is minimal.
