tldr: This article investigates the heat production in muscle twitches under different loads and lengths. The author finds that the heat of activation remains relatively constant regardless of muscle length, while the heat of shortening and mechanical work are affected by the load and length. The study suggests that activation heat is an essential component of muscle contractions and is not influenced by muscle length.
