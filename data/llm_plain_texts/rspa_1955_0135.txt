tldr: This article presents a study of the excited electronic states of 1,3-butadiene using molecular orbital theory and quantum chemistry. The authors calculate approximate self-consistent orbitals for various electronic states and compare the effects of configuration interaction using both non-empirical and semi-empirical integrals. The results provide insights into the energy levels and molecular orbitals of butadiene, which can be useful for understanding its electronic properties and spectroscopy.
