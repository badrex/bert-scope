tldr: This article investigates the gravitational perturbations of Kerr black holes and provides a solution for the metric perturbations. The author shows that the function used to express the metric perturbations is separable and can be directly expressed in terms of Teukolsky functions. Additionally, the article reveals crucial identities among the Teukolsky functions and provides numerical verification of the key equations and identities in the theory.
