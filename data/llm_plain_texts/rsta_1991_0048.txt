tldr: This article examines the behavior and influence of fluids in subduction zones, focusing on sediment deformation and fluid activity in the Nankai, Izu-Bonin, and Japan forearc slopes and trenches. The authors discuss various deformation and fluid-related processes observed in these regions, including the expulsion of pore fluids from sediments, mud diapirs, and the development of gas-hydrate phase boundaries. They also explore the differences in tectonic processes and plumbing systems in these forearc regions, which may be explained by variations in the hydrogeologic characteristics of their forearc basements.
