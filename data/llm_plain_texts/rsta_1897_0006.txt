tldr: The author conducted a series of experiments to investigate the connection between ether and matter. They used rotating steel plates and a light beam to study the effect of motion on the velocity of light. The experiments showed that there was no first-order effect of purely irrotational ethereal motion that could be optically detected, suggesting that ether is not mechanically connected to matter.
