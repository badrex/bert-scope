tldr: In 1763, Samuel Dunn observed a remarkable meteor that appeared during the afternoons in September and October. The meteor was a kind of mock Sun with a red stream of light pointing towards the real Sun. It occurred under nearly the same circumstances and may help in understanding the theory of a parhelion. This meteor was not previously registered in meteorological observations.
