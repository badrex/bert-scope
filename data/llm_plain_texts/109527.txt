tldr: A tusk from an African elephant, weighing fifty pounds and measuring six feet in length, was found to have an iron spearhead embedded in it. The spearhead was discovered when a rattling noise was heard inside the tusk. It is believed that the spear entered the elephant's trunk between its eye and its proboscis, and the animal lived for a considerable time after receiving the wound.
