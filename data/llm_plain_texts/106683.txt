tldr: The author describes a rare case of a young girl's ovarium transforming into a fatty mass containing hair and teeth. The girl's uterus and left ovarium were small, suggesting that the change did not result from a connection with a male. The author discusses the possibility of the ovarium having the power to initiate a process similar to generation without external stimulus.
