tldr: The author presents a more efficient method for calculating wave loads on offshore structures using a slender-body approach. This method can handle complex structures with non-circular cross-sections, joints, and surface intersections. The author also discusses the limitations of the theory and provides a general result for the overall global load on a moving structure.
