tldr: This article discusses the active transport of salts and water in living tissues, specifically focusing on anionic and cationic exchange mechanisms in the skin of anurans. The authors explore the independence of sodium and chloride transport mechanisms and the role of fixed charges in the membrane. They propose that the skin's transport mechanism is driven by the motive force of the cationic exchange system, with excretion acting as a physiological short circuit for sodium transport.
