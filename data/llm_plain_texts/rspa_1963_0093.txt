tldr: This article investigates the interfacial instability of two adhering anisotropic half-spaces with different rigidities under initial stress. The author derives the general characteristic equation for interfacial instability and evaluates the critical stress as a function of the rigidity ratio in the case of isotropy. The findings are relevant to the study of Stoneley waves and surface instability in elastic materials.
