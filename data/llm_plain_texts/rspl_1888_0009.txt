tldr: This paper discusses the development and structure of the electric organ in the common grey skate (Raia batis). It explains that the organ consists of disk-shaped bodies and is made up of three layers: an electric plate, a striated layer, and an alveolar layer. The author also describes the process of development from a muscular fiber to a disk and the role of muscle corpuscles in the formation of the electric organ.
