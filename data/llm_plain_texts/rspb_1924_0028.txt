tldr: The authors conducted a histological and physico-chemical investigation of the swelling of fibrous tissue, specifically mammalian skin. They observed that the swelling is affected by the histological structure of the tissue and its colloidal behavior. The study found that the swelling of skin is due to two types of distension: pseudo-swelling, where the solution passes between the fibers, and true colloidal swelling, where the solution penetrates inside the fibrils. The findings provide insights into the behavior of fibrous tissues and their response to various chemical reagents.
