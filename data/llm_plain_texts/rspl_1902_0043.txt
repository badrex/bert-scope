tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine if the saliva of certain non-poisonous snakes has toxic properties. They found that the parotid secretion of some "harmless" Colubrines is poisonous when injected subcutaneously, suggesting a gradual evolution of venom in snakes. This study contributes to understanding the venom apparatus of venomous snakes and its evolution.
