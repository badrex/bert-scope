tldr: The authors studied the distribution and division of the Golgi apparatus in germ cells during cell division. They found that the Golgi apparatus, composed of dictyosomes, divides and disperses during the early stages of cell division and reassembles near the centrosphere in later stages. This process, called dictyokinesis, is essential for the proper distribution of the Golgi apparatus in daughter cells. The research was conducted on various animal cells, including mammals, and provides insights into the role of the Golgi apparatus in cell division.
