tldr: The study demonstrates a method for visualizing and recording from motoneurons in rat spinal cord slices, allowing for investigation of their chemosensitivity and neurotransmitter function. The researchers found that motoneurons had varying sensitivities to L-glutamate, with no significant differences between soma and processes. This technique provides a valuable tool for neuropharmacological studies in the spinal cord.
