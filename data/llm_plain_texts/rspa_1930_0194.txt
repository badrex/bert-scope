tldr: The authors describe an improved integrating photometer for measuring the relative intensities of X-ray reflections from crystal lattice planes. The photometer uses a bichromated gelatin process to create a thin membrane from a photographic plate, which is then used as an obstacle to a beam of alpha particles. This method allows for more accurate and efficient intensity measurements in crystal structure analysis.
