tldr: The article discusses the X-ray crystallographic determination of an ethidium-dinucleoside monophosphate crystalline complex, providing insights into the interaction between the antitrypanosomal drug ethidium bromide and DNA. The study reveals the structure of the complex and demonstrates sequence specificity in ethidium-dinucleotide interactions, which may carry over to ethidium-DNA binding.
