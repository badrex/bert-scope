tldr: The authors conducted an experiment to study the electric octupole Coulomb excitation in rhodium using protons with energies between 700 to 1200 keV. They observed the energy dependence of the cross-section, which was consistent with the W.K.B. treatment of Alder and Winther. The absolute cross-section was found to be about three times the theoretical value, leading to two possible explanations for the discrepancy.
