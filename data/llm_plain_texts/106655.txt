tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the freezing points of nitrous and vitriolic acids. They discovered that acids with different strengths freeze at different temperatures and that the strength of the frozen part approaches that of a specific value, 411. The author also found that oil of vitriol has a strength of easiest freezing, meaning it can freeze with a relatively small amount of cold. These findings contribute to the understanding of the properties of acids and their behavior during freezing.
