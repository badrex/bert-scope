tldr: This article investigates the influence of nitric oxide on the decomposition of diethyl ether, focusing on the catalytic and inhibitory effects in homogeneous gas reactions. The authors discovered that small amounts of nitric oxide inhibit the reaction, while larger amounts catalyze it. The study provides insights into the mechanisms of catalysis and inhibition in gas reactions, with implications for understanding chemical reactions and potential applications in industry.
