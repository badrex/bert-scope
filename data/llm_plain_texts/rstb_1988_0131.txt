tldr: This study investigates the colonization of the Krakatau Islands by bacteria and the development of antibiotic resistance. The researchers compared the concentrations and diversity of microorganisms in the soils of the Krakataus and a wilderness area on Java. They found that Gram-negative rods have colonized Rakata, and the emergence of Anak Krakatau provided opportunities for comparing young and older soils within the archipelago. The study also examined the antibiotic resistance of soil bacteria and enteric bacteria of vertebrates, finding that resistance is related to the presence of vegetation rather than exposure to human activity.
