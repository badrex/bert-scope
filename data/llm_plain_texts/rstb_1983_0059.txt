tldr: This article argues against the idea that information is transferred from temporary to permanent memory. Instead, it proposes that memory is largely a function of the depth and elaboration of the initial encoding. The author discusses the different types of rehearsal and their effects on memory performance, emphasizing the importance of qualitative processing and its impact on both encoding and retrieval tasks.
