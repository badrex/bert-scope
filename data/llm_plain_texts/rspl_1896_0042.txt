tldr: This study investigates the growth and variation in the crab species Portunus depurator, focusing on the correlation between different body dimensions. Researchers collected measurements from 2,300 crabs and found that the mean dimensions of the crabs changed as they grew. The study also explored the correlation between various body parts, concluding that the correlation surfaces were similar to the symmetrical normal surface. This research contributes to our understanding of crab biology and the factors that influence growth and variation in species.
