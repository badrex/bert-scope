tldr: The author discusses the influence of ancestry in heredity and challenges the idea that ancestry has no importance in Mendelian populations. They argue that ancestry plays a significant role in determining the characteristics of offspring and that experiments that ignore the influence of ancestry are not sufficient to prove the complete absence of ancestral contributions.
