tldr: 'The article discusses the biochemical functions of terpenoids in plants, specifically focusing on abscisic acid (ABA) as a natural growth regulator. ABA is found to inhibit growth and metabolism, enhance degradative changes, and counteract the effects of other growth-promoting hormones. The study also highlights ABA's role in geotropic responses of roots, where growth curvature is caused by the asymmetric distribution of ABA produced in the root cap. The evidence suggests that ABA plays a general role in the regulation of growth and certain aspects of metabolism through its interaction with other growth substances.'
