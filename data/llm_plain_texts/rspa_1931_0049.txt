tldr: This study investigates the magnetic susceptibility of binary systems of organic liquids and how they deviate from the mixture law. The research examines the effects of intermolecular forces, association, dissociation, and compound formation on the magnetic susceptibility of various mixtures. The findings show that magnetic susceptibility is a property that can help identify changes in liquid mixtures, and it can be influenced by the electronic orbit systems of the constituent molecules.
