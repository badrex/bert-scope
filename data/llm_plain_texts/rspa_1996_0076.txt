tldr: The authors conducted experiments on three types of glasses, observing that their response to shock wave loading is dependent on their density and structure. Soda-lime glass, once considered to exhibit 'normal' behavior, shows a ramping rise in stress up to 4.3 GPa, similar to open-structured glasses with decreasing moduli. A much denser glass exhibits a true elastic jump, confirming the relationship between ramping and the open structure of glasses. At higher stresses, soda-lime glass behaves elastically-plastically.
