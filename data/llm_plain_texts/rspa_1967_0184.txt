tldr: This article investigates the magnetic hyperfine interactions in diatomic molecules, specifically in Hund's case (c) and the electronic spectrum of BiO. The authors use the method of spherical tensors and time-reversed angular momenta to calculate matrix elements and explain the observed line widths in terms of magnetic hyperfine interactions with the nucleus. They also investigate the electric quadrupole hyperfine interaction and find it incapable of accounting for the observed effects.
