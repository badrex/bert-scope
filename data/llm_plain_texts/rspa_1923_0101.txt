tldr: 'The author studied magnetic phenomena near the south magnetic pole using data from the British and Australasian Antarctic expeditions. They compared the regular diurnal variation of magnetic elements from both stations and analyzed the influence of disturbances on these variations. The author found that the opposition of phase in horizontal and inclination components of magnetism at the two stations suggests a daily oscillation in the position of the south magnetic pole.'
