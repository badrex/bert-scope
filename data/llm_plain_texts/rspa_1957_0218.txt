tldr: This paper examines Schwinger's variational principle in quantum mechanics and clarifies the class of permissible variations. The authors discuss classical and quantum theories of dynamical systems with Lagrangians linear in coordinate derivatives and consider linear variations of dynamical variables. They show that these variations can be consistently included in Schwinger's formalism and that Green's generalized commutation rules can be obtained by excluding number variations from the theory for a specific class of Lagrangians.
