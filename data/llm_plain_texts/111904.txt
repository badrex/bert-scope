tldr: The author synthesized various ureas from diamines and studied their properties. They discovered that different ureas have distinct properties and structures, and some are isomers. The study also showed that the products of decomposition of these ureas are different, indicating their non-identity. This research suggests that many compound ureas might be isomers rather than identical substances.
