tldr: The authors discuss the forces required to produce certain types of deformation in a tube of incompressible, highly elastic material. They consider the simultaneous extension, inflation, and torsion of the tube, as well as the simultaneous extension and torsion without inflating pressure. The study focuses on the stored-energy function and its implications on the material's properties.
