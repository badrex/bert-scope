tldr: 'The authors study the expected loss rates in counting particles from pulsed sources, considering the effects of dead-time and background counts. They provide calculations for different scenarios, such as short dead-time compared to pulse length and the presence of background counts. The study is relevant for understanding and improving particle detection techniques in nuclear physics.'
