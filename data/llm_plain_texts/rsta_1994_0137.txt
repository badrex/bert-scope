tldr: This article reviews the results from space missions to Venus, focusing on its tectonics and evolution. It discusses the differences between Venus and Earth, such as the lack of water, which makes the upper mantle stiffer and inhibits recycling of crust and secondary differentiates. The article also examines the surface features, such as tesserae, coronae, chasmata, and channels, and their implications for Venus's tectonic and volcanic activity. The absence of plate tectonics on Venus and the role of its high surface temperature in shaping its interior are also explored.
