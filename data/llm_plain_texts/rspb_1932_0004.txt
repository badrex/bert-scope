tldr: The author conducted experiments with the inner epidermis of the onion scale to study its electrical properties and membrane permeability. They found that the onion skin behaves similarly to the collodion membrane, being nearly impermeable for anions in dilute solutions. The study also showed that the membrane's behavior depends on the concentration of different salts, suggesting that factors other than the size of the ions determine their mobility in the membrane.
