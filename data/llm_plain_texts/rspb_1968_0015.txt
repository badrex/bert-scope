tldr: The authors investigated the organization of ampullary electric receptors in 14 species of gymnotid fish. They discovered two types of ampullary lateralis sense organs and examined their structure using light and electron microscopes. The study found that these receptors are electric sense organs and suggested that the presence or absence of a capsular envelope may be related to the mode of potential in which each type of receptor operates. The research also provided insights into the evolutionary relationships between these receptors and other receptors in the vertebrate acoustico-lateralis system.
