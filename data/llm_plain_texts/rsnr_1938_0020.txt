tldr: The author discusses the historical controversy surrounding Robert Hooke's invention of the pocket watch. Hooke's invention was initially overlooked and dismissed by the Royal Society, led by Secretary Henry Oldenburg. The author presents evidence from a 1667/8 meeting where Hooke's watch was demonstrated, proving that Hooke's invention was indeed ahead of its time. This sheds light on the potential injustice done to Hooke's reputation and the importance of accurate record-keeping in scientific history.
