tldr: 'The authors explore a new mechanism for gel formation in long-chain polymers called endlinking, which occurs when main-chain fractures create active end groups that link neighboring molecules. This process is distinct from crosslinking, which involves side-chain fractures. The authors provide a mathematical analysis of the conditions under which endlinking can form a network structure or gel, and discuss its implications for understanding the behavior of irradiated polymers.'
