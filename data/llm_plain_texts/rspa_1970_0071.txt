tldr: The authors studied the photolysis of cycloheptatriene and discovered that, in addition to the dominant product toluene, the reaction also produces small amounts of benzene, cyclopentadiene, methane, and acetylene. They investigated the mechanisms and energetics of the formation of these minor products and found that they involve different pathways and energy barriers.
