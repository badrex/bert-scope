tldr: This article examines the relationships between insects and crustaceans using comparative developmental and molecular studies. The authors suggest that insects and crustaceans share a common origin from a crustacean-like mandibulate ancestor. They focus on the specific relationships between crustaceans, myriapods, and insects, proposing that insects emerged independently from the crustacean-like ancestor after major crustacean radiations.
