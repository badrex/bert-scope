tldr: The author calculates the electric and magnetic polarisation of a thin cylinder in a uniform field, providing expressions for the mean moment of the rod and the induction across the central section. The study focuses on dielectric rods in an electric field, but also discusses the limitations of the method when applied to magnetic induction.
