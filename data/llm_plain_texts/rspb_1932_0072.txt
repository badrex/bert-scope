tldr: This study investigates the effects of various environmental factors on the development of amphibian tadpoles, particularly focusing on the abnormalities that arise due to these factors. The author exposes tadpoles to different conditions, such as sugar solutions, hydrogen, and changes in pH levels, and observes the resulting abnormalities in their development. The findings suggest that early abnormalities are not caused by lack of oxygen, as previously assumed.
