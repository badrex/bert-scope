tldr: 'The article investigates the concept of iconic memory, a pre-categorical sensory memory for visual material, and its role in processing brief visual displays. It explains that the ability to report items from these displays depends on parallel transfer from iconic memory to a post-categorical memory mode, followed by limited transfer to an output stage. The author discusses and refutes three possible explanations for the limitations in reporting items from brief visual displays, ultimately supporting the theory of iconic memory and a limited-capacity non-sensory memory system.'
