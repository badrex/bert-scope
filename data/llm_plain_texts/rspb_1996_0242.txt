tldr: The study conducted by Bergelson, Purrington, Palm, and López-Gutiérrez found that transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants with a mutant acetolactate synthase gene, which confers resistance to chlorsulfuron herbicide, had a 34% reduction in lifetime seed production compared to their susceptible counterparts. This suggests that the fitness cost of resistance is due to the pleiotropic effect of the introduced gene rather than other potential costs associated with plant transformation. The results have implications for the risk assessment of transgenic crops.
