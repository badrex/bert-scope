tldr: This study examines the dental development and succession in Marsupialia, a unique group of mammals. Unlike other mammals, Marsupialia have a peculiar dental pattern where only a single tooth on each side of each jaw undergoes vertical displacement and succession. The research also compares the dental development of Marsupialia with other mammals, such as rodents, and discusses the implications of this unique dental pattern in the evolutionary context.
