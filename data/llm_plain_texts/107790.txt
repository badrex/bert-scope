tldr: The author conducted experiments to examine the electric and chemical theories of galvanism. They demonstrated that the electric theory's fundamental principles are flawed and that the chemical theory is not universally applicable. The experiments showed that the interposed fluid does not act merely as a conductor for the electricity, and the chemical action between metals and fluids can vary, affecting the galvanic effect.
