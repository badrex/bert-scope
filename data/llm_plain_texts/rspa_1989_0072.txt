revised_title: 'Catastrophe Theory and the Speed-of-Light Limit'
semantic_tags:
  - Electrodynamics
  - Catastrophe Theory
  - Speed-of-Light Limit
  - Retarded Potentials
  - Superluminal Sources
tldr: The authors explore the catastrophe that occurs when a source moves at speeds greater than the speed of light, focusing on the implications for electrodynamics. They analyze the retarded potential and its properties in the subluminal and superluminal regimes, discussing the singularity structure and its potential physical interpretations in various field theories.
