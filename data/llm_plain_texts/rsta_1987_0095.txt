tldr: The International Cometary Explorer (ICE) spacecraft encountered Comet Giacobini-Zinner in 1985, providing the first in-situ information on the interaction between a cometary atmosphere and the solar wind plasma. The study revealed large-scale aspects of the interaction, including mass-loading and slowing of the solar wind flow, the formation of an induced magnetotail, and extreme levels of field and plasma turbulence. These findings expanded our understanding of cometary interactions and the behavior of the solar system's interplanetary medium.
