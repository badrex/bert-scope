tldr: This article discusses two significant magnetic storms that occurred in March 7-8 and August 15-16, 1918. The author, C. Chree, analyzes the records from Kew and Eskdalemuir Observatories and compares the phenomena exhibited by these storms. The study highlights the importance of the "sudden commencement" (Sc) in magnetic storms and its relation to the question of whether storms recur after a definite interval. The author also examines the sequence of events and the impact of these storms on the Earth's magnetic field.
