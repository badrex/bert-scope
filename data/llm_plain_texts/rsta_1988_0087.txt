tldr: The authors present a model for the tectonothermal evolution of the central part of the Himalayan Orogen. They describe the complex Tertiary P-T paths for the Greater Himalayan metamorphic sequence in the central Himalaya, which provide insights into the relations between tectonic and thermal processes during orogenesis. The model involves several stages of burial, uplift, and cooling, as well as the formation of leucogranite plutons.
