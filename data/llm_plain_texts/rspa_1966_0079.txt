tldr: This study investigates the relative rates of reaction of hydroxyl radicals with methane, carbon monoxide, and formaldehyde using the homogeneous decomposition of hydrogen peroxide vapour as a source of hydroxyl radicals. The results show that hydroxyl radicals react faster with methane and carbon monoxide than with formaldehyde, and the reaction rates are temperature-dependent. The findings contribute to understanding the oxidation processes of these molecules and the role of hydroxyl radicals in these reactions.
