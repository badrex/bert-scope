tldr: The article discusses the use of isothermal titration microcalorimetry to study the thermodynamics of biomolecular recognition, focusing on peptide and protein interactions. The authors demonstrate the technique's application in understanding the binding of small peptide analogues to vancomycin antibiotics and the effects of cyclic polysaccharides and non-aqueous solvents on protein stability.
