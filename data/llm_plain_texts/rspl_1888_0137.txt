tldr: The author describes experiments conducted on the spinal cord and cortex to simulate epileptic seizures. They observed electromotive changes in the cord, which resulted in persistent (tonic) and rhythmical (clonic) effects. These findings provide insights into the nature of epileptic fits and the underlying physiological processes.
