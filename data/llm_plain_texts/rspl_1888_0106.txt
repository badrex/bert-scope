tldr: Lord Rayleigh conducted experiments to determine the atomic ratio of oxygen and hydrogen through combustion. He found that the atomic weight of oxygen is 15.89, with a margin of error due to the difficulty in weighing hydrogen accurately. This research contributed to the understanding of the composition of water and the properties of gases.
