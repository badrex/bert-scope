tldr: This article investigates the chemical composition and properties of German brown coals and Irish peat. The authors examine the effects of heat on these materials and analyze the gases and substances produced during their carbonization. The study provides insights into the origin of the main "coking constituents" of bituminous coals and contributes to the understanding of coal chemistry and fuel research.
