tldr: William Barlow was a self-taught crystallographer who made significant contributions to the understanding of crystal structures. He expanded on Sohncke's work and, along with Schonflies and Fedorow, developed the geometrical theory of crystal structure. Barlow's work on space groups and closest-packed assemblages of equal spheres helped lay the foundation for understanding the symmetry and structure of crystals. Although his mechanical theory was too simple for complex cases, it was a crucial step in the development of crystallography.
