tldr: This article discusses recent theoretical research into hypersonic flow, focusing on boundary layers, shock layers, nozzle flows, and their interactions and transition properties. It explores the fundamental area of steady, laminar, external planar flows in the hypersonic strong-interaction regime and internal steady flow through a slender hypersonic nozzle. The article also considers aspects of instability and transition of the hypersonic boundary layer, its wake, and the inviscid shock layer, including viscous and inviscid modes, their interaction, surface cooling, and nonlinear effects.
