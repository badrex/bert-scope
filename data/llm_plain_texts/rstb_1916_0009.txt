tldr: The author investigates the relationship between transpiration and stomatal aperture using a porometer, a device that measures the rate of air flow through stomata. The results show a parallelism between stomatal aperture and transpiration rate, with stomata playing a significant role in regulating transpiration. The author also discusses the limitations of the method and the factors affecting stomatal behavior.
