tldr: Signior Fracassati conducted an experiment to determine if the black color of blood grown cold is due to the presence of melancholy humor. He found that the color change occurs because the blood underneath is not exposed to air, and it turns red when exposed to air. This experiment challenges the common belief about the composition of blood and melancholy.
