tldr: This article investigates the influence of physical conditions on the velocity of decomposition of certain crystalline solids. The authors found that the temperature coefficient is a complicated quantity dependent on several factors, and the heat of activation cannot be calculated directly. They also discovered a simple relation connecting the rate of evolution of oxygen from solid solutions of potassium permanganate in potassium perchlorate and the heats of activation of potassium permanganate in the various solid solutions.
