tldr: This article discusses the life and work of William Rutherford, a significant yet overlooked figure in British physiology during the Victorian era. Rutherford made important contributions to the field, including research on the vagus nerve, bile secretion, and striated muscle, as well as being a pioneer in practical experimental physiology education. Despite his achievements, Rutherford's work and reputation were overshadowed by his contemporaries and the challenges he faced in his personal and professional life.
