tldr: The authors, E. Rutherford and J. J. Thomson, developed a magnetic detector to investigate electrical waves and high-frequency discharges. They discovered that magnetized steel needles could detect and measure rapidly alternating currents. The detector offered a simple means to study various phenomena related to high-frequency discharges and could be used over a wide range of periods of alternation.
