tldr: This study examines the long-term stability of morph frequency and species distribution in a sand-dune colony of land snails, Cepaea nemoralis and C. hortensis. The research focuses on a colony at Seaton Sluice, Northumberland, where the two species coexist, which is unusual. The authors investigate the stability of the distribution patterns and the possible causes, such as competitive selection, climatic selection, or an 'area effect.' The study finds that the mixed colony is likely stable, with the boundary between the two species' distributions remaining unchanged over a 16-year period.
