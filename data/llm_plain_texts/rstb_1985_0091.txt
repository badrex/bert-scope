tldr: 'The study of the nothosaur Pachypleurosaurus provides insights into the evolution and aquatic locomotion of plesiosaurs. Nothosaurs, like modern crocodiles and marine iguanids, relied mainly on lateral undulation of the trunk and tail for aquatic propulsion. The transition from terrestrial ancestors to fully aquatic plesiosaurs involved changes in patterns of aquatic locomotion, with nothosaurs and plesiosaurs sharing a common ancestry.'
