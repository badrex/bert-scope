tldr: The authors discovered a small elephant species, Elephas Cypriotes, in Cyprus during the Pleistocene era. This discovery adds to the understanding of dwarf species in the Mediterranean and their possible independent development due to similar circumstances and environments. A more detailed account with figures and descriptions is planned for future communication.
