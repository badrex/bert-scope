tldr: This article investigates the behavior of electrolytes in mixed solvents, specifically focusing on the free energy of lithium chloride in water-alcohol mixtures and the salting-out of alcohol. The authors found that the extent of salting-out is properly measured by the difference between the observed effect and the normal effect, and that alcohol is salted out from the whole range of solutions. The free energy of transfer of lithium chloride between water and both methyl and ethyl alcohols is less than that of the chlorides of sodium and potassium, indicating a greater radius for the lithium ion.
