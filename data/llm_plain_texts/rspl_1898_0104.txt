tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the refractive indices and densities of normal and semi-normal aqueous solutions of hydrogen chloride and alkali chlorides. They found that both densities and refractive indices generally increase with molecular weight, but there is an exception with potassium chloride having a slightly lower refractive index than sodium chloride. The results provide valuable data for understanding the properties of these solutions and their applications in various fields.
