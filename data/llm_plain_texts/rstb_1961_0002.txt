tldr: The article examines the organization and function of the atrial nervous system in amphioxus (Branchiostoma lanceolatum). It describes the various components of the system, its connection to the central nervous system, and its role in regulating the feeding process and spawning. The study concludes that the atrial nervous system is not directly comparable to the autonomic system of craniates, and that further research is needed to understand its true function and homology with other organisms.
