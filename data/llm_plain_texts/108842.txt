tldr: The author discusses Tschirnhausen's Transformation, a method for converting a quartic equation into another equation of the same degree. They also explore the concept of invariants in algebra, showing how they remain unchanged under certain transformations. The author applies these ideas to both quartic and quintic equations, providing valuable insights into the properties of these mathematical constructs.
