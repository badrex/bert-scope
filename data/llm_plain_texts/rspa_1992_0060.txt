tldr: The authors study the properties of axially symmetric electrodynamic balances and analyze their levitation ability and stability characteristics. They derive a unified theory for the stability of all electrodynamic balances with a non-vanishing quadrupole field term and propose procedures to optimize balance shapes for stably levitating particles of maximal mass-to-charge ratio. The existence of classes of optimum balances and the nonexistence of a unique optimum balance shape are demonstrated.
