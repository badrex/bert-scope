tldr: This article is an erratum for a previous study on the nucleation of vorticity by ions in superfluid 4He. The authors correct a mistake in the legend of figure 2, which should now read: "Figure 2. Tidal residuals, (a) flow: streamlines indicate flow in units of 10^4 x cubic meters per second; sea level variations in centimeters."
