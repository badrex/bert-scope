tldr: This article presents an analysis of the magnetic phenomena recorded at the Kew Observatory from 1859 to 1864 using horizontal and vertical force magnetometers. The author identifies 1859 as the year of greatest disturbance in both horizontal and vertical forces, and 1863 and 1864 as the years of least disturbance. The findings show an agreement with the decennial variation in solar spots, indicating a connection between solar activity and magnetic disturbances on Earth.
