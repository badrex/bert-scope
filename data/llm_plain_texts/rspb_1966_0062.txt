tldr: The study examines the unique relationship between the caterpillar of Ephestia kuehniella and its habitual parasite Nenteritis canescens. While caterpillars typically encapsulate alien parasites, they do not react to larvae of Nenteritis, which can develop unhindered within the host. The parasite's ability to avoid the haemocytic reaction is due to its unaltered surface, which is acquired late in its embryonic development. This research provides insights into the complex interactions between insects and their parasites, as well as the mechanisms of host defense and immune response.
