tldr: This article explores the dynamics of sprint running, focusing on the role of viscosity and efficiency in muscle fibers. It explains how a runner's speed affects the number of muscle fibers needed to perform a task, and how this can lead to greater energy expenditure and waste. The article also discusses the concept of an "optimal speed" for completing a given task, and how this can vary depending on the type of exercise.
