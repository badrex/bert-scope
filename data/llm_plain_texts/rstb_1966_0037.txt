tldr: This study examines the fighting behavior of marine iguanas, a species endemic to the Galapagos Islands. The author discusses the ritualized nature of their fights, which involve displays and headbutting instead of biting, and how this behavior differs from that of other animals. The existence of ritualized combats in vertebrates suggests a strong selection pressure towards aggressivity and highlights the importance of these behaviors in maintaining social order and spacing-out among species.
