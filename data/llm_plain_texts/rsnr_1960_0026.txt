tldr: The author, a Viscount, discusses the importance of a well-rounded education that combines both humanities and science. He argues that students who choose science should have a solid grounding in humanities, as they often have less exposure to it compared to their classical counterparts. The speaker also predicts a future problem of leisure and suggests that society needs to adapt to the idea that work is not the only measure of respectability.
