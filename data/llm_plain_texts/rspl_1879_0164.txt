revised_title: Investigation of Electric Discharge and Vacuum Tube Potential
semantic_tags:
  - Electrochemistry
  - Vacuum physics
  - Electric discharge
  - Tube potential
  - Static charge
tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine if there is a chemical polarization in the terminals of a vacuum tube after the discharge has been interrupted. They found that the current obtained from the terminals of a vacuum tube after being disconnected from the battery is due to a static charge and not a chemical polarization.
