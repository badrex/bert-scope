tldr: The authors studied the distribution and isoenzyme patterns of acetylcholinesterase activity in subcellular fractions of bovine splanchnic nerve trunks and adrenal medulla. They found that soluble acetylcholinesterase activity exists in both tissues and is not derived from the membrane-bound form. The authors also discovered that the soluble acetylcholinesterase in adrenal medulla is distributed between five isoenzymes, while only one isoenzyme is found in the supernatant fraction of splanchnic nerve homogenates.
