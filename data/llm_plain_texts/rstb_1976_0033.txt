tldr: This study investigates the water relations of a barley and wheat crop, focusing on leaf water potential, stomatal resistance, and environmental factors. The authors measured stomatal conductance and leaf water potential hourly, comparing the results to environmental factors like radiation, temperature, and humidity. They found that leaf water potential and stomatal conductance are influenced by soil water potential and environmental factors, and that the concept of crop conductance can be examined in relation to measured changes in leaf stomatal conductance on days of different soil water potentials.
