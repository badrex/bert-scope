tldr: The authors investigate the rigidity of two types of triangulated hyperbolic paraboloidal structures, type 1 with straight boundaries and type 2 with parabolic boundaries. They find that both types satisfy Maxwell's rule, but type 1 assemblies with even edge numbers and greater than 2, and type 2 assemblies with specific conditions, are not rigid. The study provides a general formula for the number of inextensional mechanisms and static redundancies in single-sheet triangulated hypars of type 1 and 2, and extends the findings to four-sheet hypars.
