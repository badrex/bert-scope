tldr: The author conducted experiments on plant cells, specifically in Prosera and Mimosa pudica, to study their contractility and movement. They discovered that certain changes in the cells cause increased impenetrability, and they suggest that this is due to a contraction of the protoplasm. The author believes that this contractility is responsible for the movements in irritable plant organs and that it is similar to the contractility found in animal cells.
