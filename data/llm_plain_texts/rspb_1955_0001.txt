tldr: The author discusses the role and function of mucin, a slimy secretion, in the alimentary tract. Mucin, which is secreted in response to local, nervous, and hormonal stimuli, acts as a lubricant, protecting the mucosa from mechanical trauma. It also helps neutralize hydrochloric acid by raising the pH, making the action of pepsin less effective. The author also mentions the relationship between mucin and intrinsic factor, which is essential for the utilization of vitamin B12.
