tldr: 'George Lynn observed and recorded the movements and positions of Jupiter's satellites using a thirteen-foot telescope. He also observed the passage of time and the relationship between celestial objects, such as Saturn and stars. His observations suggest that tracking the passages of the first and second satellites could be useful in determining longitude.'
