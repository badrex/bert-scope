tldr: The study examines the photoreceptors in the retina of the Alligator mississippiensis using in situ single-cell microspectrophotometry and scanning electron microscopy. The retina contains four cone visual pigments and one rod pigment. The research provides insights into the variety of photoreceptor shapes and sizes, as well as the light absorption characteristics of the visual pigments in the cones and rods. This information contributes to understanding the visual system of crocodilians.
