tldr: The author investigates the periodicity of rainfall by analyzing long-term data from various locations. They find that there is no clear evidence of a short-term cycle in annual rainfall, and that predictions based on existing materials are unreliable. The study also shows discrepancies in rainfall patterns between nearby locations, suggesting that local factors may play a significant role.
