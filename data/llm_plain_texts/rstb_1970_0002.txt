tldr: The study investigates the structure and function of a connective chordotonal organ in the cockroach leg, specifically the tibio-tarsal joint. The organ contains 26 bipolar sensory neurons with dendrites associated with 14 scolopales, arranged in three groups. The organ responds to downward and backward deflexion of the tarsus, with different sensory fibers showing distinct responses. The research provides insights into the functioning of individual cells and the role of chordotonal organs in signaling joint position and movement in insects.
