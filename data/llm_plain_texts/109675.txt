tldr: Edward Troughton describes a new method for dividing astronomical instruments by ocular inspection without using traditional tools. The method ensures accuracy by minimizing errors caused by vision and using the best optical means for viewing and measuring minute quantities. This technique can be applied to various instruments, including those used at the Royal Observatory.
