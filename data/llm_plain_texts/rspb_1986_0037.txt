tldr: 'Picoplankton are tiny organisms found in seas and lakes that can pass through a 2 µm filter but not a 0.2 µm filter. They are well adapted to planktonic life, sinking slowly and efficiently taking up nutrients and light. Picoplankton includes coccoid cyanobacteria and various eukaryotic algal forms. These tiny organisms play a crucial role in recycling nutrient elements in the marine ecosystem and have a significant impact on primary productivity in natural waters.'
