tldr: The author, John Swinton, discovered an inedited Greek coin of Empress Crispina, wife of Emperor Commodus. The coin features a legend and inscription that points to the inhabitants of an ancient town, Dardanossa or Daranissa. Swinton believes the coin was struck in this town, which was part of Sophene, a province of Greater Armenia, during the Roman Empire's reign. This discovery allows for the emendation of a corrupted proper name in Ptolemy and provides insight into the historical context of the region.
