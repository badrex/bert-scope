tldr: The author introduces self-consistency into the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) method for molecular orbitals, aiming to improve the understanding of molecular bonding and electronic charge distribution in a wider range of molecules. The method minimizes the zeroth-order energy and allows for the calculation of molecular properties, such as magnetic and bond properties, and estimation of ionization potentials.
