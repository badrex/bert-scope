tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the salivary glands of dogs and cats to study the electrical phenomena accompanying the secretion process. They discovered that the process of secretion is accompanied by definite electrical changes, and the nature of these changes varies depending on the type of nerve stimulation and the character of the secretion. The findings provide insights into the physiological mechanisms of salivary gland secretion and the role of nerves in this process.
