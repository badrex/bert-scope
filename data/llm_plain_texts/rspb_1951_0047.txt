tldr: The study examines the adaptation and Mendelian segregation in yeast strains' ability to utilize galactose. It shows that the improvement in growth rate is an adaptive response of the bulk of the population and not due to the selection of variant cells. The research also reveals that the absolute ability to metabolize galactose is controlled by a single gene, and those segregants that can metabolize galactose exhibit varying degrees of training towards this substrate.
