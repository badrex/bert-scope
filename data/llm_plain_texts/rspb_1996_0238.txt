tldr: The study investigates the frequency-dependent advantage of left-handed individuals in fights and aggressive interactions. It compares the proportion of left-handed individuals in the general population and in sporting individuals, finding a higher proportion of left-handers in interactive sports, which reflects some fighting elements. This frequency-dependent advantage might explain the stability of left-handedness in humans.
