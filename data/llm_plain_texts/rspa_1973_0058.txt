tldr: The authors introduce internal coordinates into the infinite-component Majorana equation, showing that the Majorana system can be represented as a two-dimensional oscillator, a two-dimensional Kepler problem, or other potential systems. They discuss the space-like and light-like solutions of the Majorana equation and its relation to Dirac's new wave equation without negative energy solutions.
