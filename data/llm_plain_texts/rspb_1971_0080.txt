tldr: This study investigates the termination of the lateral geniculo-cortical pathway in cats and monkeys. The researchers found that the thalamic afferent fibres primarily terminate in layer IV of the visual cortex, with some also ending on dendritic spines and shafts of stellate cells. The findings provide insight into the synaptology of the thalamic pathway to the visual cortex and its variations between individual visual areas and species.
