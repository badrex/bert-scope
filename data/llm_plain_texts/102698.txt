tldr: In 1664, Reverend Mr. John Ray and Mr. Samuel Dale observed a comet in the constellation Hydra. They described the comet's size, brightness, and tail, which pointed towards the heart of Hydra. Over several days, they noticed the comet's movement and changes in its appearance. The observations were made during cloudy nights, which limited their ability to fully analyze the comet's behavior.
