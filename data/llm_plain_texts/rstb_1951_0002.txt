tldr: The author investigates the shoot apex of Rhoeo discolor, a spirodistichous plant, to understand the factors affecting leaf localization. They discovered that the position of a new leaf depends on a balance between inhibitory influences from existing leaf centers. The study provides insights into the differences in leaf localization mechanisms between monocotyledons and dicotyledons, supporting Richards' theory of phyllotaxis.
