tldr: The author investigates the development of the free-swimming nauplius of Leptodora hyalina, a crustacean, focusing on the role of ectoderm and mesoderm in its formation. They observe the formation of organs, muscles, and the heart, and discuss the origin of the maxillary and antennary glands. The study provides insights into the early stages of crustacean development and the role of different tissues in their growth.
