tldr: The authors developed a new, rapid spectroscopic recording technique using laser photolysis to obtain photographic absorption spectra of transient intermediates with nanosecond lifetimes. This technique provides time-resolved absorption spectra over a wide spectral range in a single experiment, allowing the study of excited states and free radical intermediates of short life. The authors applied this technique to observe absorption spectra arising from the lowest excited singlet states of several aromatic hydrocarbons, providing insights into the non-radiative process of intersystem crossing and the energies of higher excited singlet levels.
