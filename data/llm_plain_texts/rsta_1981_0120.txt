tldr: This article discusses the formation and evolution of Earth's continental crust during the first 800 million years. It presents a new model for heterogeneous accretion and explores the processes of differentiation, volcanism, and mantle convection that shaped the Earth's early crust. The author also examines the role of impacts on crustal evolution and the development of oceanic and continental regions.
