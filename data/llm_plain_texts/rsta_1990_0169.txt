tldr: This article discusses recent developments and future prospects of NMR imaging, specifically focusing on line-narrowing techniques for solid state NMR imaging. The authors present a class of homonuclear line-narrowing imaging methods that use short gradient pulses and second averaging to improve spatial resolution and signal sensitivity. They also consider the potential applications and challenges of solid state NMR imaging in materials sciences.
