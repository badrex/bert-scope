tldr: The author investigates the phenomena of cloudy condensation and the effects of electrification on steam jets. They discovered that electrification prevents water droplets from coalescing, resulting in a dense and electrified jet. This research sheds light on the relationship between electricity and water droplets, and the factors affecting the density of condensation.
