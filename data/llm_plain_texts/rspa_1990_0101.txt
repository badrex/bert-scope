semantic_tags:
  - Reaction-diffusion equations
  - Heat and mass transfer
  - Exothermic reactions
  - Porous reaction zones
  - Catalyst beds
tldr: This article investigates stationary-state solutions for a simple model of exothermic reactions in a catalyst bed or porous reaction zone. The study focuses on the infinite slab and cylinder geometries, considering both Dirichlet and Robin boundary conditions. The authors explore the dependences of temperature and concentration profiles on various parameters and the number of possible steady-state solutions, ranging from one to five, depending on the geometry and boundary conditions.
