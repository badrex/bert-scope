tldr: The authors studied the structure of multilayers of fatty acid esters using electron diffraction. They found that the esters possess an orthorhombic structure similar to polymorphic crystalline forms. The side spacings and orientation of the molecules in the multilayers were analyzed, revealing a pseudo-regularity due to twinned orthorhombic crystals.
