tldr: The study investigates the feeding mechanisms and cirral activity in the barnacle Balanus perforatus. It discovers that the barnacle has a unique mode of cirral beating, different from other Balanus species. The barnacle pumps a powerful water current through its mantle cavity, capturing small planktonic prey like nauplii. The maxillipeds and mouthparts play a crucial role in captorial planktivory, while the large, setose maxillipeds create a filtratory action correlated with the mantle current. The evolution of rhythmic cirral beating in balanoids could have occurred more than once, and the study suggests that these neural mechanisms control a skeleto-muscular system similar to non-rhythmic, extension-feeding balano-morphs.
