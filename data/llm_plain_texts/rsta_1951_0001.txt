tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the thermodynamics of benzene-diphenyl solutions. They determined the partial molar heat content, entropy, and free energy of benzene in solutions of diphenyl by measuring the partial pressures of benzene over the solutions. The study covered the whole composition range, at temperatures from 30 to 60°C. The results were compared with recent statistical theories, showing some deviations due to slight changes in molecular packing as the composition was varied.
