tldr: This study investigates the distribution of Wolbachia bacteria among neotropical arthropods in Panama. The researchers found that 16.9% of the insect species surveyed were infected with Wolbachia, with double infections occurring at higher frequencies than expected. The results suggest that Wolbachia may play a significant role in rapid speciation in insects.
