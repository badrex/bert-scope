tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of cupric salts on isolated cerebral tissues. They found that cupric salts, such as Cu2+, can cause changes in the composition and excitability of the cell-containing tissue, leading to a decrease in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels. This research helps to understand the toxic effects of Cu2+ salts on the central nervous system in animals and humans.
