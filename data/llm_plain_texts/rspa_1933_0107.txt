tldr: The authors conducted precision measurements of the velocity of sound waves in gases contained in resonating tubes over a moderate temperature range. They investigated the applicability of the Helmholtz-Kirchhoff expression for the relation between the free-space velocity and the tube velocity in a gas. The experiments involved six gases with varying viscosities and densities, and six tubes made of different materials (glass, copper, and carbon). The results provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors affecting sound velocity in gases.
