tldr: This study examines the use of statistical methods for quality control and new product testing in small businesses, focusing on fast-growth firms and matched firms in the northeast of England. The research finds limited use of statistical methods in both areas, with fast-growth firms using them more than matched firms. Most firms do not lack advice on quality control but believe that statistical methods are not suitable for their needs.
