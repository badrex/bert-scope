revised_title: 'Exploring the Causes of Iridescent Colors in Insect Scales'
semantic_tags:
  - Insect biology
  - Structural colors
  - Optics
  - Interference theory
  - Thin films
tldr: The authors investigate the causes of iridescent colors in insect scales and explore various theories, including diffraction, interference of light in thin films, and selective reflection. They analyze the microscopic structure of scales and provide evidence that supports the interference theory as the primary cause of iridescent colors in insects.
