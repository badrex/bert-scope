tldr: The authors studied the luminous reduction of selenium dioxide when it reacts with various organic compounds and gases. They observed characteristic moonlight-like flames and analyzed the flame spectra and reaction products. The main products of these reactions were carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and water. The study provides insights into the complex reactions and mechanisms involved in the reduction of selenium dioxide.
