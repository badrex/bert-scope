revised_title: 'Mechanism of Bile Absorption and Pressure of Bile Secretion in Bile Duct Obstruction'
semantic_tags:
  - Bile duct obstruction
  - Bile secretion
  - Bile absorption
  - Liver physiology
  - Animal experiments
tldr: The authors conducted experiments on animals to study the pressure of bile secretion and the mechanism of bile absorption during bile duct obstruction. They found that the maximum pressure of bile secretion varies among different animals and that the pressure at which bile secretion is balanced by absorption is not an absolute measurement of liver cell force. The study provides insights into the physiology of the liver and bile ducts.
