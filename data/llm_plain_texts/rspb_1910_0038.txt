tldr: The authors conducted experiments to examine the afferent nerve fibers and receptors of the third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerves. They found that these nerves contain afferent fibers that play a role in maintaining muscle tone in the eye muscles. The study confirms the presence of various nerve endings and receptors in the extrinsic eye muscles, which are essential for their function and regulation.
