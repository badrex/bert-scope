tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the sublimation and volatilisation of metals at low pressures. They found that the extent of disintegration of a metal increases with temperature and that the presence of oxygen augments the effect. The authors also observed the formation of deposits on surfaces near heated metals, which they attributed to the projection of metal particles in a rectilinear manner.
