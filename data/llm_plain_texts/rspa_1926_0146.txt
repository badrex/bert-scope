tldr: 'This study investigates the longitudinal magneto-resistance effect in single crystals of iron and its relationship with crystal structure. The research finds that the crystal structure significantly affects the magnitude of the resistance change, but no change of sign of the phenomenon is observed. The findings contribute to the understanding of the relationship between magneto-resistance and crystal structure in iron.'
