tldr: The author investigates the establishment of the dilatation effect in a field of sound waves by considering a medium with slight viscosity. They derive important theorems related to pressure exerted by sound waves and examine the process of establishing the phenomenon during the setting up of a sound field in a special case. The study provides insights into the behavior of sound waves and their pressure in various scenarios.
