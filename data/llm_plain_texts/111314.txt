tldr: The author, W.D. Chowne, conducted experiments to determine the velocities of air currents in vertical tubes due to the presence of aqueous vapor in the atmosphere. He used anemometric discs and an aspirator to measure the velocity of currents and found a correlation between the increase in atmospheric humidity and the velocity of air currents. This research provided further evidence that variations in air current velocities are largely due to changes in atmospheric humidity.
