tldr: The author discovered that trypanosomes in the tsetse-fly's hind gut are in the process of becoming encysted. Encystation is a crucial step in the life cycle of the parasite, allowing it to be swallowed accidentally by a vertebrate host, where it germinates and enters the blood, eventually being taken up by the tsetse-fly. This cycle is similar to other protozoan parasites and provides insight into the transmission of Trypanosoma grayi.
