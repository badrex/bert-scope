tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments to study the electric spark's constitution, focusing on the velocity and propagation of metallic vapour. They discovered that different metallic lines in the spectrum had varying inclinations, indicating the velocity of the metallic vapour's propagation. The research also revealed that the discharge was oscillating, with the period of oscillations being large enough to be separated in the photograph. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the electric spark's nature and its underlying mechanisms.'
