tldr: This study investigates the incidence of constitutive heterochromatin, or G-bands, in the chromosomes of 56 Fritillaria species and subgenera using Giemsa banding. The research reveals wide differences in the size and number of bands among species, with some having more bands localized near the centromeres. The findings contribute to understanding the evolution and speciation in the Fritillaria genus.
