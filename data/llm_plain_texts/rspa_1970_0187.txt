tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the interaction of atomic particles with solid surfaces at intermediate energies. They measured the angular and energy distributions of charged particles emitted from polycrystalline and crystalline platinum bombarded with ions of hydrogen, nitrogen, and argon. The results showed that the distributions were influenced by the angle of incidence, bombarding energy, and surface cleanliness. The study provides insights into the mechanisms of secondary electron emission and particle scattering from solid surfaces, which can be useful for material characterization and understanding ion-atom interactions.
