tldr: The author describes a new set of small pocket microscopes invented by James Wilson, which can easily view opaque, transparent, and liquid objects. These microscopes were useful for observing various natural phenomena, such as the circulation of blood in living creatures, the animalcula in semen, and the structure of insects. The author also provides instructions on how to use these microscopes and cautions on the importance of light for proper viewing.
