tldr: This article proposes a multidimensional approach to understanding the motivational control of animal behavior. The authors argue that any model of motivational processes can be represented by isoclines in a causal-factor space, which join points with the same degree of competitiveness for behavioral expression. They outline an empirical method for determining motivational states and discuss its implications for motivation theory.
