tldr: The authors investigate the optimal choice of experimental sampling points for Laplace transform inversion in the recovery and resolution of exponential relaxation rates from experimental data. They consider uniform and geometric distributions of data points and find that geometric sampling reduces the number of required sample points for inversion, improving the restoration of exponential components. This has significant implications for the design of scientific experiments and instruments.
