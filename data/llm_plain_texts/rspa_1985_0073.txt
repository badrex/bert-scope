tldr: The authors conducted a detailed study of the effect of magnetic breakdown on the oscillatory magnetization in aluminium. They discovered that the amplitude of the de Haas-van Alphen magnetization of the magnetic breakdown orbit in aluminium exhibits unexpected behavior as a function of the magnitude and orientation of the magnetic field. The results are explained by a generalized model that takes into account the variation of breakdown fields and cross-sectional areas for wavevectors along the field direction near the extremal sections. This model helps to understand the anomalous effect of magnetic breakdown on the oscillatory magnetization.
