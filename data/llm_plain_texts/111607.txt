tldr: The author, Charles Babbage, presents a theory explaining the discovery of human artifacts mixed with the bones of extinct animals in caves. He suggests that the artifacts and bones were deposited together through a series of geological events, including the filling and emptying of caverns by water, and the movement of sediment. This theory helps to explain the coexistence of human and animal remains in caves without implying the great antiquity of human civilization.
