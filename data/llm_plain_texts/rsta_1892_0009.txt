tldr: This article investigates the thermal emissivity of thin wires in air and how the shape and size of the cooling body affect the rate of heat loss. The authors found that the cooling of thin wires is influenced by the shape and size, which is important for electrical engineers working with glow-lamps, hot-wire voltmeters, and fuses.
