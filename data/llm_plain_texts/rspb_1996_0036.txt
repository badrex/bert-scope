tldr: This study investigates how nutritional constraints affect the expression of the black throat badge, a sexual trait in male house sparrows. Researchers found that juveniles developed smaller badges than adults when moulting in the field. However, when given access to an abundant food supply in captivity, both age groups developed similar-sized badges. The results suggest that nutritional condition, specifically the use of blood proteins, constrains the production of larger badges. This finding supports the hypothesis that badges are costly to produce, and the magnitude of the costs may be age-dependent.
