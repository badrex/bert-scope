tldr: This article presents a general theory for estimating the sound radiated from a fluid flow, with rigid boundaries, containing regular fluctuations or turbulence. The author, M. J. Lighthill, explains the mechanism of energy conversion from kinetic to acoustic energy and demonstrates how the intensity of the sound field depends on the frequency and strength of the quadrupoles in the flow. The theory is applicable to completely subsonic flows and can be used to estimate the sound radiated from various fluid flows, including turbulent jets.
