tldr: This paper investigates the variations in the mean diurnal inequality of the horizontal component of the Earth's magnetic force at Bombay, comparing them to the sun-spot period. The study reveals a nearly eleven-yearly periodical variation in the magnetic force, which precedes the sun-spot area curve by six months. The findings support Dr. Stewart's views on the relationship between magnetic variations and solar heat.
