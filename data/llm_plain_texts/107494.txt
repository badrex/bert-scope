tldr: The author investigates the irregularities observed in compass needles of naval ships, specifically H.M.S. Isabella and Alexander, due to the attraction of iron contained within the ships. The study examines the effects of local attraction and how it corresponds with previous observations and rules for calculating corrections. The findings contribute to understanding and improving the accuracy of compass navigation in ships.
