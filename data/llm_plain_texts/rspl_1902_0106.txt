tldr: The author examines the histology of Uredo dispersa and its behavior in grass tissues. They use improved hardening and staining methods to study the fungus's life cycle and cellular interactions with the host plant. The research disproves Eriksson's Mycoplasm hypothesis, which suggested that rust epidemics result from a transformation of a latent, invisible substance in the host's cytoplasm.
