tldr: The authors present a mathematical analysis of network formation in irradiated polyesters, focusing on gel formation and solubility. They develop a model that considers a combination of polymerization reactions and the linking of polyester molecules, taking into account factors such as cross-linking index, molecular weight, and molecular weight distribution. This analysis extends previous work on radiation-induced cross-linking and degradation of long-chain polymers to the case of chain reactions in shorter molecules.
