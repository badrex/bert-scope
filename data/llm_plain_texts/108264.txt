tldr: The author, Captain Newbold, conducted thermometric observations on the temperature of springs, wells, and rivers in India and Egypt. The study aimed to understand the temperature variations and chemical composition of these water sources. The findings provide insights into the mean temperature of the climate, elevations of land, and the chemical nature of springs. The author also discussed the influence of atmospheric and geological factors on the temperature and chemical composition of these water sources.
