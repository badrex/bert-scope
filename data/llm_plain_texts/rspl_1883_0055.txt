revised_title: The Influence of Pressure on the Temperature of Volatilization of Solids

tldr: This article investigates whether solids have definite volatilizing points under different pressures, similar to how liquids have boiling points. The authors conducted experiments with various substances, including water, acetic acid, benzene, naphthalene, and camphor, and found that solids do have specific temperatures of evaporation corresponding to definite pressures. The results show that the difference between the temperatures of evaporation and boiling points for solids and liquids, respectively, is extremely small.
