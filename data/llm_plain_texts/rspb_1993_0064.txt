tldr: Researchers discovered that synthetic membrane filters, devoid of any added lipid or protein, exhibit current fluctuations similar to those observed in biological ion channels. These filters show rapid transitions between high-conducting and low-conducting states, ion selectivity, and inhibition by divalent cations and protons. These findings suggest that ion conductance at the interface may play a significant role in ion channel function.
