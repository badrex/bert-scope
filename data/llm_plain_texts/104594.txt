tldr: Dr. le Cat describes a new type of glassware for preserving anatomy and natural history specimens in spirituous liquors. The glass features a circular groove around the edge of its orifice, which allows for a cover with a border to be placed, creating a seal that reduces evaporation. This invention is more cost-effective and efficient than previous methods, making it a valuable tool for scientists and collectors.
