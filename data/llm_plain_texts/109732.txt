tldr: 'John Playfair and Lord Webb Seymour conducted a lithological survey of Schehallien Mountain to determine the specific gravity of its rocks. They found that the mountain consists of primitive rocks in strata, with the most elevated part made of granular quartz and micaceous schist. They also discovered veins or dykes of porphyry and greenstone. The specific gravity of the mountain was found to be 2.64 for granular quartz and 2.81 for micaceous schist. The authors calculated the density of the earth based on these findings and recommended further experiments on granite mountains for more accurate results.'
