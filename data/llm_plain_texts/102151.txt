tldr: This article describes a unique species of bees found in the West Indies that create honeycomb structures made of small brownish-black wax bottles. These bees lack stingers and are more vulnerable to disturbances. The honey they produce is clear and has a laxative effect when consumed. The author also mentions other exotic plants and products from the region, such as cinnamon, ambergris, and a small melon from Guinea.
