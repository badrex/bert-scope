tldr: The author integrates the boundary-layer equations using an asymptotic solution containing an unknown parameter. The method of steepest descent is applied to evaluate integrals, and Euler's transformation is used to sum divergent expressions. The results are applied to Blasius and Falkner-Skan equations, and the general boundary-layer equation for flow past an elliptic cylinder, showing close agreement with experimental data.
