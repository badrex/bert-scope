tldr: This article explores the role of DNA bending and anisotropic bendability in nucleosome positioning. The authors use DNase I as a probe to study the organization of DNA in nucleosomes and find that the bending preference of DNA is a significant determinant of nucleosome positioning. This has implications for understanding chromosome structure and function in eukaryotic cells.
