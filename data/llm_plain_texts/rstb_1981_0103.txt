revised_title: 'Platelet Aggregation and Vessel Wall Interactions in Damaged Blood Vessels'
semantic_tags:
  - Platelet aggregation

tldr: This article explores the interaction between platelets and damaged blood vessels, focusing on how platelets aggregate in injured vessel walls to form haemostatic plugs. The author discusses the role of haemodynamic conditions in and around vascular leaks and the chemical agents responsible for making platelets reactive. The article also examines the relationship between atherosclerosis, plaque fissures, and the formation of arterial thrombi.
