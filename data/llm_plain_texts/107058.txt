tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the different types of heat, both solar and terrestrial, and their rays. They discovered that these rays are subject to the laws of reflection and refraction and have the ability to heat objects. The author also found that prismatic colors are accompanied by heat-making rays that can be reflected.
