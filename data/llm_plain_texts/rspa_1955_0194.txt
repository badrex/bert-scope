tldr: The authors critically discuss the current absolute scale of thermo-electric power and present preliminary measurements towards its redetermination. They emphasize the importance of accurate absolute values of thermo-electric power for comparing experimental data with theoretical predictions, especially at low temperatures. The authors also investigate the thermo-electric behavior of superconductors just above their transition temperature, finding a discontinuous change in the thermo-electric power.
