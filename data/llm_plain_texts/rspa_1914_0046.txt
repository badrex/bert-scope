tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the rate of hydrogen solution in palladium under different conditions and forms. They observed that the rate of solution varies depending on the form of palladium, suggesting that the phenomenon of solution in this metal is complex and may involve both adsorption and diffusion. The results support the idea that the dissolved gas in hydrogen-palladium is not homogeneously distributed, and that solution occurs through an amorphous metallic phase acting as a vehicle for gas transference.
