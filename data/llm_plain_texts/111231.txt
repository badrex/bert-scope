tldr: J.P. Joule responds to a letter by M. Regnault, defending his experiment on the specific heat of air. Joule explains that his result, which he considers sufficient for his purpose, was confirmed by Regnault's work. Joule and Thomson are continuing their research on the thermal effects of rushing elastic fluids, hoping that Regnault's findings will help their investigation.
