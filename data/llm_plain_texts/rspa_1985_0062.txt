tldr: The article investigates the vibrational satellites in the rotational spectrum of the hydrogen-bonded homodimer HCN \#x2022; \#x2022; HCN. The authors use a combination of Stark-modulation and pulsed-nozzle, Fourier-transform microwave spectroscopies to analyze the complex vibrational satellite series in the hydrogen cyanide dimer's spectrum. They find that the vibrational satellite pattern is dominated by progressions in the hydrogen-bond stretching mode and the hydrogen-bond bending modes. The study provides insights into the hydrogen-bond potential functions and electrical changes that accompany dimer formation.
