tldr: This study compares the effects of stovaine and cocaine on muscle contractility and toxicity. The experiments show that both drugs have similar affinity values, but stovaine produces vaso-dilatation while cocaine causes vaso-constriction. Stovaine is found to be less toxic than cocaine, making it a more suitable option for anaesthesia.
