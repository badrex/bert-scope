tldr: The study investigates sex ratio variation in sheet-web spiders, particularly in Pityohyphantes phrygianus and Linyphia triangularis. The authors found differences in female mating behaviors and genitalia, which suggest that a mechanism in the female's spermathecae-ducts is responsible for the sex ratio bias. Experimental manipulations of the female's position after mating showed that it significantly changed the proportion of males in the first brood, indicating that females have options to control offspring sex ratio.
