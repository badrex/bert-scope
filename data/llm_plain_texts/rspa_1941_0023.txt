tldr: This article discusses the methods for defining and evaluating the intrinsic electric strength of solid dielectrics. It explores how the electric strengths of certain crystals agree with Frohlich's theory of electronic breakdown. The article also examines the effects of temperature and electric stress on conductivity and the differences in behavior between complex organic dielectrics and crystals.
