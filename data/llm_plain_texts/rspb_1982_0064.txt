tldr: The authors discovered that exocytosis, the process of releasing neurotransmitters from cells, can be divided into two stages: a trifluoperazine-insensitive stage involving the translocation of secretory granules to the plasma membrane and a trifluoperazine-sensitive stage resulting in granule-plasma membrane fusion. This finding suggests that exocytosis is a more complex process than previously thought, and it may involve the protein calmodulin.
