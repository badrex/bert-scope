tldr: Joseph Priestley investigates the conducting power of charcoal and discovers that the degree of heat applied during the coaling process determines its conductivity. He also observes that animal substances do not shrink during coaling, unlike vegetable substances, and that the conductivity of charcoal is not affected by the presence of flames during the coaling process.
