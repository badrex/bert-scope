tldr: The authors explore the properties of commutative ordinary differential operators and their relationship with Abelian functions. They establish a theory for determining the general pair of operators that satisfy a prescribed identity and discuss the transformation of these operators through transference. This work contributes to the understanding of mathematical analysis and applied mathematics.
