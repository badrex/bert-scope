tldr: The article discusses the potential of lunar laser ranging for measuring tectonic motions and detecting changes in Earth's station positions. The technique uses laser beams to the Moon to measure distances with high accuracy, allowing scientists to study Earth's movements and understand the forces acting on it. The author presents numerical error analyses to assess the system's capabilities and potential improvements by adding more stations in the southern hemisphere.
