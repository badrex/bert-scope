revised_title: 'Geochemical Processes in Sedimentary Systems: A General Discussion'
semantic_tags:
  - Sedimentary geochemistry
  - Diagenesis
  - Fluid flow
  - Pore space
  - Mineral solubilities
tldr: This article discusses the geochemical processes in sedimentary systems, focusing on the remaining pore space in sandstones, diagenesis rates, and fluid flow. The authors debate whether large-scale fluid flow is necessary for diagenetic alteration or if it can be explained by nearly closed system behavior. They also discuss the solubility of silica and the contribution of pressure solution to cementation.
