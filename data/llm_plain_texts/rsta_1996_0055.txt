tldr: This article explores the interaction between the Earth's core and mantle through numerical calculations of magnetoconvection in a rotating spherical shell. The study investigates how the thermal coupling between the core and mantle affects the structure of the geomagnetic field. The results indicate that mantle structure is of secondary importance compared to rotation in controlling the structure of the geomagnetic field.
