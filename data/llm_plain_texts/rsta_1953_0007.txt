tldr: The authors present a transformation of the hodograph equation in two-dimensional gas dynamics, which allows them to determine various fluid motions, including nozzle flows and aerofoil flows past cylinders. They provide analytical and numerical details for specific examples and discuss the utility of this method for finding physically significant solutions.
