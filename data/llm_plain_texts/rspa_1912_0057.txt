tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the ultimate lines and quantities of elements in oxyhydrogen flame and spark spectra. They found that the ultimate lines in flame spectra are generally less refrangible than in spark spectra. The authors also developed a method to photograph the ultimate lines in spark spectra using dry electrodes and analyzed the spectra of various elements, including strontium, barium, copper, silver, gold, gallium, indium, thallium, tin, lead, manganese, and nickel.
