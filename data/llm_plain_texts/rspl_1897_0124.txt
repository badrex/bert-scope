tldr: The author conducted experiments on eels to study the effects of removing their suprarenal bodies. They found that eels can survive without these bodies for a longer time than mammals or frogs, suggesting that the cortical gland is not essential for their life. This discovery challenges the idea that the eel's suprarenal gland is the fundamental type of the suprarenal capsule in mammals.
