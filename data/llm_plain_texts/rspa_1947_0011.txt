tldr: The authors studied the initiation and growth of nitroglycerine explosions using electrical and photographic methods. They found that the period of impact between colliding solids is about 200 microseconds, and the explosion is initiated by a tiny hot gas bubble. The flame spreads through the cavity and then bursts through the cavity wall, causing the main explosion. The explosion propagates through the film with a velocity greater than 1000 meters per second. The authors also studied the rate of coalescence of strips of explosive and the time at which initiation occurs.
