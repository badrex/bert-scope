revised_title: 'Influence of Magnetic Fields on the Polarization of Resonance Radiation'
semantic_tags:
  - Magnetic fields
  - Resonance radiation
  - Polarization
  - Mercury vapour
  - Sodium vapour
tldr: This article explores the effects of magnetic fields on the polarization of resonance radiation in mercury and sodium vapour. The authors discovered that a weak magnetic field can completely destroy polarization in resonance radiation, and they provide methods to measure and control the polarization using various experimental setups.
