tldr: This article examines the thermal stability of a chemically reacting slab with time-periodic surface temperature oscillations. The authors reduce the problem to an ordinary differential equation and find that the behavior depends on the solutions of Hill's equation. They derive critical values of the Frank-Kamenetskii parameter as a function of the amplitude and frequency of the surface temperature oscillations.
