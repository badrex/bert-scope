tldr: The author conducted a series of experiments to analyze the composition and properties of sandarach resins. They discovered three different resins, A, B, and C, with varying solubilities and chemical properties. Resin A has the formula C40H31O5, resin B is a bright-yellow, brittle substance, and resin C is a pale-yellow powder. These findings contribute to the understanding of the chemical composition of resins and their reactions with alkalis.
