revised_title: The Interaction of Inert Gases and Completed Shells
semantic_tags:
  - Quantum Mechanics
  - Inert Gases
  - Chemical Binding
  - Atomic Theory
  - Spherical Symmetry
tldr: This article explores the interaction of inert gases from a quantum mechanical perspective. It discusses how completed shells, which have no degeneracy, can still have exchange integrals and contribute to chemical reactions. The author also presents a theorem on spherical harmonics and explains how it relates to the interaction of spherically symmetrical atoms in a -state.
