revised_title: Invariance of Stresses under Varying Elastic Compliances
semantic_tags:
  - Elasticity
  - Invariance of stresses
  - Compliances
  - Plane strain
  - Plane stress
tldr: The authors demonstrate that stress states can be invariant upon a linear shift in elastic compliances, depending on the connectivity of the domain and some side conditions. They discuss smooth compliances, discontinuous compliances in composite materials, and global compatibility for multiply connected domains.
