tldr: The authors conducted experiments on 14 different liquids to study their viscoelastic properties in the supercooled region. They discovered a new theoretical model that can predict the viscoelastic behavior of pure liquids within experimental error. This model is considered a limiting case for liquids that follow the free volume description of steady flow viscosity. The results show that the effective viscoelastic relaxation region extends over a wider range of frequency than that for a single relaxation time process based on the Maxwell model.
