tldr: The authors reviewed studies of basal archosaur phylogeny since 1975 to evaluate the impact of cladistic methods and assess whether there is a current consensus in this field. They found that the transition to modern numerical cladistic analyses has led to an increase in agreement between separate hypotheses, but also identified areas of disagreement and the need for further research to improve the strength of hypothesized clades.
