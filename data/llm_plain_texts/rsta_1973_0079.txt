tldr: The article discusses the fixed nuclei two-centre problem in quantum mechanics, focusing on one-electron diatomic molecules. The author develops a new technique for finding the asymptotic expansion of the electronic energy in inverse powers of the internuclear distance and applies it to the united atom and separated atom states. The non-crossing rule and energy level splittings are also examined.
