tldr: This article investigates the relationship between lenticular absorbance and fluorescence in the human eye lens, focusing on age-related changes. The author calculates the fluorescence of the lens based on absorbance data and nuclear geometry assumptions. The resulting fluorescence profiles and their variations with age are computed, supporting the hypothesis that lens yellowing is due to lifelong exposure to light.
