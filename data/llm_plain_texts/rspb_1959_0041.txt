tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of X-radiation on enzyme induction and growth in Escherichia coli. They found that irradiated bacteria can grow faster on maltose and glutamate compared to unirradiated controls. The results suggest that irradiation induces permease for maltose in the bacteria, leading to faster growth rates.
