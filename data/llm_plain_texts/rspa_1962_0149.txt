tldr: The oxidation of isobutene catalyzed by hydrogen bromide was investigated in a static system. The reaction was found to be autocatalytic, with the main chain carriers being bromine atoms and peroxy radicals. The reaction rate was accelerated by added bromine, tert-butyl hydroperoxide, and di-tert-butylperoxide, and was retarded by added alcohols. The study provides insights into the reaction mechanism and kinetics of the oxidation process.
