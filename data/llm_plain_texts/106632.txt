tldr: In 1786, Nathaniel Pigott observed the transit of Mercury over the Sun from Louvain, Netherlands, using a Gregorian reflector and other instruments provided by M. Thysbaert. Pigott's observations showed discrepancies in the calculated and printed times for the event, leading to a discussion on the accuracy of astronomical data at the time. The observation and analysis of this transit contributed to the understanding of planetary movements and the improvement of astronomical instruments.
