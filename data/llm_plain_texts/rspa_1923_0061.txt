tldr: This article examines the temperature variations in the upper atmosphere and explores possible explanations for the high temperatures found above 60 km. The authors suggest that the air absorbs sunlight and earth's radiation, leading to a potential change in temperature between summer and winter. They analyze meteor observations and other factors to support their hypothesis.
