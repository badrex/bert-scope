tldr: 'J. T. Desaguliers conducted magnetic experiments using iron bars and demonstrated how the orientation of the bars affects the attraction of a compass needle. He found that when an iron bar is held upright, it attracts the north end of the compass needle with its upper end and the south end with its lower end. When the bar is inverted, the magnetic properties change, and the ends attract the opposite ends of the compass needle. Desaguliers also discovered that striking the bar against the ground or other horizontal surfaces can alter its magnetic properties.'
