tldr: This study investigates the role of glutathione in oxidation and reduction processes in tissues. The researchers found that glutathione acts as an intermediate hydrogen acceptor, transferring hydrogen from its thiol form to various acceptors, such as methylene blue and molecular oxygen. The results show that the reaction between methylene blue and reduced glutathione is autocatalytic, meaning the reaction products have a catalytic effect on the reaction. This discovery sheds light on the importance of glutathione in biological processes.
