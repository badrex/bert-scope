tldr: The author, George Buist, studied the unique properties of Lotus leaves and other water-resistant surfaces. He discovered that the Lotus leaf has microscopic papillae that entangle air, creating an air-plate that prevents water from touching the leaf. This phenomenon also occurs in other plants and animals, such as water fowl feathers. Buist suggests that this natural process could inspire the development of waterproof clothing and materials without using rubber or other waterproofing chemicals.
