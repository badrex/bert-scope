tldr: The author, Charles Lyttleton, presents a beautiful nautilites fossil to the Royal Society. The fossil appears to be composed of stony matter that has penetrated the cells of the nautilus while in its natural state. The different colors of the stony matter give it a unique appearance. The fossil was found in Pool's Hole in Derbyshire and its sutures or diaphragms resemble those of some larger Cornua Ammonis, but its shape indicates it is a species of Nautilus, and it is considered a non-descript in both its natural and fossil state.
