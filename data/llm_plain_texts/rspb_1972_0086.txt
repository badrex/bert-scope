tldr: The author reviews the history and development of prostaglandin research, discussing their chemical structure, biosynthesis, metabolism, and pharmacology. Prostaglandins are lipid-soluble substances derived from prostanoic acid, with diverse pharmacological actions, including effects on smooth muscle, platelet aggregation, and interactions with the adenyl cyclase-cyclic AMP system. They are widely distributed in animal organs and have been isolated from various tissues, with minute amounts needed for central nervous system effects.
