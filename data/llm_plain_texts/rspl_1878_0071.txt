tldr: The author investigates the effects of geological changes on the Earth's rotation and ocean tides, considering the Earth's interior as an elastic and viscous substance. The study provides insights into the subsidence of inequalities on the Earth's surface, the adjustment of a rotating spheroid to a new equilibrium, and the acceleration of the time of high water. The author also applies the theory to lunar semi-diurnal and fortnightly tides, suggesting that the Earth has a significant effective rigidity.
