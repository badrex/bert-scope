tldr: The author, William Sharp, presents a new method for treating fractured legs using a two-part instrument called "upper and under splints." These splints are made of strong pasteboard and are strapped onto the leg, providing support and stability. The method allows for better healing and reduces pain and inconvenience for the patient. The author also suggests a new posture for the patient during recovery, which is more comfortable and convenient than the traditional extended position.
