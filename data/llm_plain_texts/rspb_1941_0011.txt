tldr: This study investigates the resistance to desiccation in different Drosophila mutants affecting body color. The results show that yellow mutants lose weight faster than wild-type flies in dry conditions, but their resistance to desiccation is similar in more humid environments. The authors suggest that the yellow cuticle may be more easily wetted than the wild-type cuticle, which could explain the differences in desiccation resistance.
