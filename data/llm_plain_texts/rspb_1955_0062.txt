tldr: 'This study investigates the vertical migration of Daphnia magna in a laboratory setting using a tank filled with a suspension of indian ink in tap water. The results show that light is the primary factor influencing the animals' movements, and they undergo a complete cycle of vertical migration when an overhead light source is cyclically varied in intensity. The study provides insights into the physiological mechanisms underlying diurnal migration and the role of light in these movements.'
