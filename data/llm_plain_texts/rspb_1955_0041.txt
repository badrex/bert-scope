tldr: This article discusses the concept of heterosis, or hybrid vigor, in chromosome behavior. The author investigates the effects of inbreeding on chromosome efficiency in rye plants and finds that hybrid offspring have better chromosome behavior than their inbred parents. The study highlights the importance of hybridization in plant breeding and the role of genetics in controlling chromosome behavior.
