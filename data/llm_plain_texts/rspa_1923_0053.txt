revised_title: 'Iridescent Beetle Coloration: Exploring the Role of Multiple Thin Plates'
semantic_tags:
  - Structural coloration
  - Insect coloration
  - Thin film optics
  - Interference
  - Beetle anatomy
tldr: The author investigates the iridescent coloration in scaleless beetles and concludes that it is due to multiple thin plates causing interference. This theory is supported by analyzing the beetle's spectrum and comparing it to diffraction patterns. The author also dismisses the surface reflection theory as it does not explain the observed phenomena.
