tldr: 'The author discusses the dynamics of tidal bores, focusing on the energy losses that occur during their formation. They analyze the equations of motion and energy for a one-dimensional model of the bore and conclude that the motions cannot be reversed due to energy conservation. The author also mentions the controversy surrounding the discontinuous solution for the bore's motion and its relation to the violation of energy conservation.'
