tldr: This study investigates the carotid rete and its associated arteries in various mammals, including cats, sheep, goats, oxen, and pigs. The researchers found that a well-developed carotid rete is present in some species and is associated with the non-persistence of the internal carotid artery. The carotid rete's compact network of arteries has a possible haemodynamic significance, and its existence should be considered when studying problems related to the cerebral circulation in species with this structure.
