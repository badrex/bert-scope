tldr: The author analyzes the fossil extinction record and finds that it is compatible with a power law distribution of extinction events. This result is in agreement with predictions based on self-organized critical models of extinction. However, the author argues that there is a simpler explanation for the power law in terms of extinctions caused by stresses on species from their environment. A model is presented to explain this process and its implications for the interpretation of the fossil record.
