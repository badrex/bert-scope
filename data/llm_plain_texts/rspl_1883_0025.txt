tldr: A new species of crinoid, Themmatocrinus renovatus, was discovered in the Southern Sea at a depth of 1,800 fathoms. This small crinoid has only five arms and features a closed ring of large plates on the exterior of the calyx. Its unique characteristics make it stand out among other recent crinoid types. The discovery of this species and its distinct features contribute to our understanding of crinoid evolution and the history of marine life.
