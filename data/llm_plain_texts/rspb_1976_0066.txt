tldr: This study examines blood pressure variations in highland and lowland Ethiopian populations, focusing on the effects of age, socio-economic status, and chronic diseases. Unlike other high-altitude regions, highland Ethiopians had higher blood pressures than lowlanders. Socio-economic factors played a role, with higher status individuals having higher pressures. Chronic infectious diseases, such as malaria and respiratory disease, were not associated with lower blood pressure. The study suggests that socio-economic status and infectious disease prevalence, along with altitude, may contribute to the higher blood pressures observed in high-altitude dwellers.
