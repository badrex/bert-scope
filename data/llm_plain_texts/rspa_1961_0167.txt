tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments on lithium isotopes to study the effect of a change in mass on the electronic specific heat. They found no significant difference in the electronic specific heats of lithium-6 and lithium-7, with a coefficient of about 390. This result has implications for understanding the behavior of materials at low temperatures and the role of electron-lattice interactions.'
