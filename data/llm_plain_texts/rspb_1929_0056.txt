tldr: The author examines the morphology and cytology of Bacterium malvacearum, a plant pathogen causing angular leaf-spot disease in cotton. They discover internal structures and variations in the bacteria's morphology, which were initially thought to be artifacts or contaminations. The study adds to the understanding of bacterial species with varying reproduction types and contributes to the field of plant pathology and microbiology.
