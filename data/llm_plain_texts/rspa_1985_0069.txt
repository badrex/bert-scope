tldr: This study investigates the boundary layer separation of a two-layer rotating flow on an f-plane, using both analytical and numerical methods. The results demonstrate the existence of a fully attached vertical boundary layer with an inner reversed flow region, and show that flow reversal occurs when the vertical shear of the oncoming flow is strong enough. The streamwise extent of the reversed flow region decreases with increasing inertial effects, which control the existence of boundary layer separation downstream of the reversed flow region.
