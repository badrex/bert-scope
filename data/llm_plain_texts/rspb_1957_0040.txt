tldr: The study investigates the ability of suckling rats to produce antibodies and the role of y-globulin in their immune response. It shows that rats can produce antibodies efficiently even when not suckling their mothers, and that the antibodies are concentrated in the y-globulin fraction. The research also reveals that actively immune young rats have a higher concentration of y-globulin in their sera compared to normal rats, suggesting that y-globulin plays a significant role in the immune response of young rats.
