  - Wave-Function
tldr: The authors derive the classification of multiplets, selection rules, and summation rules from Dirac's relativistic equation for an atom with multiple electrons. They discuss the non-relativistic theory of inner and magnetic quantum numbers and their selection rules, which are essential for understanding the behavior of electrons in an atom.
