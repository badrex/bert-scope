tldr: The authors used laser magnetic resonance spectroscopy to study the atmospheric reactions of the H0\lt;sub\gt;2\lt;/sub\gt; radical. They determined rate coefficients for various reactions involving the radical, which play a significant role in atmospheric ozone removal cycles. The study provides insights into the chemical processes occurring in the atmosphere and contributes to understanding the impact of these reactions on the environment.
