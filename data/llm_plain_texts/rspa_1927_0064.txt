tldr: The author studies the mercury band-spectrum and its characteristics. They develop a new method to excite the band spectrum using a discharge from a Wehnelt cathode, which produces a bright band spectrum with minimal line spectrum. The author investigates the effects of current strength and evaporation rate on the spectrum, finding that smaller currents and rapid evaporation favor the band spectrum. They also discover that the line spectrum cannot be entirely eliminated, even with small currents.
