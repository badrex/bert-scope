tldr: This study investigates the static diffusion of gases and liquids in relation to carbon assimilation and translocation in plants. The authors found that the diffusivity constant for carbon dioxide remains consistent across various ratios of mixture, and they discovered new facts about static diffusion that help explain certain natural processes in plants. They also developed a new method for determining the diffusivity constants of atmospheric CO2, vapors of liquids, and substances in solution.
