tldr: The authors conducted electron microscopy studies on spinal ganglion cells to better understand their structure and the nature of Nissl's substance. They discovered that Nissl's substance is made up of granules of size range 50 to 200 A and is present in two types of cells: light and dark cells. The study also revealed the fine structure of the nuclear membrane and the presence of lipid lamellae in the cells, which is important for understanding the function of spinal ganglion cells.
