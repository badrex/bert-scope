tldr: Mr. David Thomas shares his observations on a monstrous calf and its stone, which he had previously mentioned in the Philosophical Transactions. He describes the calf's thick skin and claw-like feet, as well as the stone's irregular shape, color, and composition. Thomas also mentions that he has sent a part of the stone to Oxford for further examination.
