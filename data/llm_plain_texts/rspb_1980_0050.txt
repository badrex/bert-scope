tldr: The study examines the variation in the architecture of the multiple-bank retina in the deep-sea teleost, Chauliodus sloani, as the fish grows. It finds that as the fish grows, new banks of rods are added to the retina, increasing the density of rods and nuclei in the outer nuclear layer. The study also discusses the implications of these findings for the development and function of the multiple-bank retina in deep-sea species.
