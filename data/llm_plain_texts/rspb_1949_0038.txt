tldr: The author studied the antigenic relationship between spermatozoa of different mammalian species using antisera prepared against them. The results showed that most antisera had strong cross-reactions with spermatozoa of other rodent species, weaker reactions with ferret and dog spermatozoa, and no reaction with bull, goat, or fowl spermatozoa. The study suggested that the spermatozoa of rabbit and guinea-pig were more closely related antigenically than they were to those of the mouse.
