tldr: The author investigates the effect of egg white on the heart contractions of chick embryos in vitro. They discovered that egg white causes uncoordinated contractions, or "twittering," in the heart cells, preventing normal coordinated pulsations. The study used entire hearts of 2-3 day embryos in egg white media to observe the effect.
