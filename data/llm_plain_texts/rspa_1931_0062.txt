semantic_tags:
  - Colloidal liquids
  - Viscosity
  - Suspensions
  - Copper ferrocyanide
  - Cadmium sulphide
tldr: 'The authors studied the viscosity and rigidity of aqueous suspensions of fine particles, specifically copper ferrocyanide and cadmium sulphide. They discovered that these suspensions exhibit variable viscosity when unstable, and the phenomenon requires a certain time to appear. The suspensions become rigid under specific conditions. The study provides insights into the connection between variable viscosity and elasticity towards shearing forces and the conditions of physical stability or instability.'
