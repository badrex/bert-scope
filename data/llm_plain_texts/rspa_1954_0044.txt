tldr: The article presents a general method for investigating the thermodynamic effects of the dependence of intermolecular potential on orientation for axially symmetric molecules. The author expands the intermolecular potential in a way that separates the central-force part and directional parts classified in terms of various angular symmetries. The free energy of an assembly of such systems is calculated by treating the directional parts as a perturbation on the central-force part, leading to a simple expression for the extra free energy due to directional forces in terms of molecular distribution functions.
