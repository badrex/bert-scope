tldr: The authors studied the formation and growth of vacancy loops in magnesium, observing that excess vacancies aggregate on close-packed planes to form dislocation loops. They found that these loops grow more commonly than shrink due to a high vacancy concentration in the thin foil. The stacking fault energy was determined from the growth kinetics of the loops, providing insights into the properties of magnesium.
