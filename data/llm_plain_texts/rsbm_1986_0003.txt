tldr: The article is a biographical memoir of Carl Ferdinand Cori, a pioneering biochemist who, along with his wife Gerty, made significant contributions to the field of carbohydrate metabolism. Their work focused on the breakdown of glycogen in animal cells and the enzymic regulation of this process. This research led to the discovery of the cyclic AMP system and the reversible phosphorylation of enzymes, which are important regulatory mechanisms in biology and medicine.
