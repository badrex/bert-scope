tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments with bacterial strains of Escherichia coli to study drug resistance in recombinants. They discovered that recombinants show a continuous spectrum of drug resistance between the values of their parent strains. The study provides a quantitative measure of drug resistance and sheds light on the distribution of resistance in recombinants, which can help in understanding drug resistance in microorganisms.'
