tldr: In a letter from Vienna, Dr. Edward Brown describes his observations of two parhelia, or mock suns, and their associated phenomena. He notes the brightness and colors of the parhelia, as well as the presence of rainbows and a white circle segment passing through the parhelia and the sun. These observations were made during a time when the air was mostly clear, with only a few thin clouds scattered about.
