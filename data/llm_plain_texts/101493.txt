tldr: The author presents problems related to navigation and proposes a new method for calculating the line of artificial tangents, which could improve the accuracy of navigation and the creation of logarithms. The author also suggests a wager to prove the identity of the artificial tangent line and the meridian line, with the potential for significant benefits to merchants, mariners, and the commonwealth.
