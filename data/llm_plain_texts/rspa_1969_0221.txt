tldr: The authors measured the permeability of 206 non-electrolytes in rabbit gall-bladder epithelial cells and analyzed the relationship between their permeation and lipid-water partition coefficients. They found that most non-electrolytes follow a general pattern, but two classes of deviations are related to the specific structure of cell membranes. Highly branched molecules and small, lipid-insoluble molecules show different permeation behaviors, which are attributed to the anisotropy of membrane lipids and the interaction with localized concentrations of membrane polar groups.
