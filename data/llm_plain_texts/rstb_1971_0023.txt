tldr: This article discusses the observations and analysis of migrant waders at Aldabra Atoll between September 1967 and March 1968. The authors list seventeen species of waders, compare their observations with other locations in the area, and analyze the different habitats at Aldabra. They conclude that Aldabra is not an important wintering ground for most wader species, but it may have some value as a resting place during migration. The Crab Plover, however, seems to have Aldabra as one of its few wintering grounds.
