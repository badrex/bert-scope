tldr: The authors analyze the experimental data on cosmic-ray geomagnetic effects to understand the nature of primary cosmic rays and the process of meson formation. They discuss three main hypotheses: proton, mixed, and soft component hypotheses. The analysis suggests that the bulk of mesons arise from protons or other positively charged particles, and the primary radiation consists of protons and electrons in a ratio of about one proton to four electrons.
