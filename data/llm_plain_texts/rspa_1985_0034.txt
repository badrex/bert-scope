tldr: This study examines the fracture and toughness of various woods through crack propagation and relates it to their densities. The research finds that the fracture toughness of woods is significantly higher for cracks that lie normal to the grain compared to those that propagate parallel to the grain. The findings can be explained by the fracture mechanics of very anisotropic solids. The study also discusses the structure of wood, its properties, and the influence of growth rings, rays, and sap channels on its fracture toughness.
