tldr: The article introduces a definition of quasi-local charges in Yang-Mills theory, inspired by Penrose's quasi-local momentum in general relativity. The charges are defined through an endomorphism of a vector space of solutions to certain equations, and their eigenvalues represent the charges. The author also discusses the dimension of the vector space and provides an example using Lienard-Wiechert solutions.
