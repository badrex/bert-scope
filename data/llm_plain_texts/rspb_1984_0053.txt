tldr: This study investigates the expression of cholinergic properties in rat Schwann cells in isolation and in co-culture with primary fat myotube cultures. The results show that the level of choline-acetyltransferase in co-cultures increases after three weeks, suggesting that cholinergic properties are induced in Schwann cells. The findings support the hypothesis of a positive signal that triggers the expression of cholinergic function in glial cells.
