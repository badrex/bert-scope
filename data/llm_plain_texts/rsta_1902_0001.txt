tldr: The author investigates the process of tempering iron that has been hardened by overstrain. They discover that annealing, heating the iron above a certain temperature and allowing it to cool slowly, can partially soften the material. This process, called tempering, is applicable to both steel and wrought iron. The study also shows that annealing lowers the primary yield-point and reduces the step by which the yield-point is raised due to overstrain and recovery from overstrain.
