tldr: The author, Peter Barlow, conducted experiments to understand the effect of temperature on the refractive index and dispersive power of expansible fluids used in telescopes. He found that the index of refraction varies directly with density, while the dispersive ratio remains constant. This research helped improve the accuracy of telescopes with fluid lenses.
