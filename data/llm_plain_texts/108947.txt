tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the coefficients of expansion for water and mercury by measuring their changes in length when heated. They developed a method using glass rods and a specially designed apparatus to weigh the metals in water at different temperatures. The results provided insights into the expansion of alloys and the accuracy of temperature measurements.
