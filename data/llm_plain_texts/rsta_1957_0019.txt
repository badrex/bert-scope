tldr: This paper presents a development in the statistical theory of mixtures of spherical molecules, specifically those interacting according to the Lennard-Jones inverse-power potential. The assumption of random mixing is used to relate the thermodynamic properties of the mixture to those of a reference substance, following the law of corresponding states. The theory can account for mixing effects in non-polar liquid solutions and is applicable to gases and liquids.
