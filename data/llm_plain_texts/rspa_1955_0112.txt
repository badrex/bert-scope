tldr: This article explores the inelastic scattering of neutrons by magnetic spin waves in ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic crystals. The authors develop a spin-wave theory using the formalism of Holstein and Primakoff, considering the influence of dipole-dipole interaction and applied magnetic fields. They derive scattered intensity distributions and total cross-sections, providing a better understanding of the low-lying energy states of magnetic crystals and the spin-wave interaction's effect on neutron scattering.
