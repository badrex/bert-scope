tldr: 'This article investigates the decline of fisheries in acid lakes and streams, analyzing the effects of acidity on fish populations and water quality. The authors discuss the inconsistencies in observations, suggesting that other factors may be important in determining fishery status. They examine the physiological effects of acid exposure on fish and explore the potential for predicting future fishery status based on water quality. The article highlights the need for a more detailed understanding of the mechanisms of damage and the development of effective remedial actions.'
