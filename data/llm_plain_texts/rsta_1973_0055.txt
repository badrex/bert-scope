tldr: The article discusses earthquake fault studies in Japan, focusing on the off-Honshu tectonics. It reviews the measurement and interpretation of changes in strain, using observations from the south Kanto district. The author highlights the importance of geophysical instruments and geodetic surveys in monitoring crustal processes and understanding the mechanisms of stress transmission in tectonic units.
