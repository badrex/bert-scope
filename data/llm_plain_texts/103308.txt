tldr: 'In this article, Dr. Patrick Blair describes the dissection of a five-month-old emaciated child. The child's stomach and intestines were examined, revealing a preternaturally thick peritoneum and a cartilaginous pylorus and duodenum. The lack of omentum and the child's symptoms of vomiting and urinary and fecal stoppage are discussed, leading to the question of whether the child's illness may have been caused by the absence of this vital part of the digestive system.'
