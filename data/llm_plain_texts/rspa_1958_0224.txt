tldr: The authors conducted direction-finding and radio observations on the 20 Mc/s transmissions from the first Russian artificial earth satellites. They demonstrated that it is possible to derive the elements of the local track from a single observational sequence. The study provides insights into ionospheric wave propagation phenomena and discusses possible mechanisms for long-distance radio transmissions.
