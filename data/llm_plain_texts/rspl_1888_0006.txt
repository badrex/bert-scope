tldr: The author, W. H. Preece, investigates the heating effects of electric currents in various materials, such as iron, tin, lead, and an alloy of lead and tin. He provides tables with the calculated current in amperes required to fuse wires of different sizes and materials, as well as the diameters of wires that will be fused by a given current strength.
