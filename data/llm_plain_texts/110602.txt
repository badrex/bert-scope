tldr: The author, Martin Barry, examines the ovisac and Graafian vesicle in various vertebrates, particularly mammals. He describes the structure and function of these reproductive components, including the tunica granulosa, retinacula, and membrana granulosa. Barry also discusses the process of oogenesis and the role of the ovisac in the development of the ovum. His research challenges previous assumptions about the Graafian vesicle being a structure unique to mammals.
