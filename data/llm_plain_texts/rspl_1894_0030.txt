tldr: The author presents a theory that explains the secular variation of the magnetic declination and inclination using an electro-dynamic substance rotating within the earth's crust. The magnetarium, a new electro-mechanism, is used to demonstrate the period of backward rotation and the cause of the inequality of the declination periods in different regions. The author also compares the magnetarium's results with recent observations of the dip and declination at various locations.
