tldr: This study investigates the distribution of electricity in thunderclouds using sounding balloons and an altielectrograph, a device that records changes in potential gradient and electrical charges. The authors found that the distribution of electricity in thunderclouds varies significantly, with positive charges found at higher altitudes and negative charges near the ground. This research provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of thunderstorms and the circulation of electricity in the atmosphere.
