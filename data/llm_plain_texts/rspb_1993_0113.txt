tldr: The authors discovered a sex-specific sequence in birds of prey, specifically the red kite, which is located on the W chromosome. This sequence reveals complex polymorphic patterns in the Accipitridae family, allowing for the development of a sexing technique and monitoring matriarchal success and dispersion. The study also provides evidence of a dramatic bottleneck in the Welsh population and possible introgression from the continent.
