tldr: The article discusses the molecular evolution of serine protease and its inhibitor, focusing on the dynamic changes and independent evolution of functional domains. The authors propose that these domains may have been ancestral minigenes and that studying the DNA sequence database can help identify the minimum set of these ancestral genes necessary for maintaining life forms.
