tldr: This study investigates the effects of temperature, pressure, and excitation wavelength on the photoluminescence of acetaldehyde vapour. The results show that at longer excitation wavelengths, pressure affects emission yields, indicating that collisional deactivation to vibrationally equilibrated levels of the excited singlet state followed by intersystem crossing to the triplet state is the main energy dissipation mode. At shorter excitation wavelengths, predissociation becomes more important. The study also shows that collisional deactivation of excited singlet acetaldehyde molecules by acetaldehyde and trans-butene-2 occurs through a single-stage mechanism, while isobutane may involve complex formation.
