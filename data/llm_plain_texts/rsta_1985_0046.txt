tldr: This article explores the connection between the representation theory of affine Lie algebras and soliton equations. It demonstrates how the orbit of the simplest affine Lie group, SL(2, C)A, provides solutions to the Korteweg-de Vries equation and the sine-Gordon equation. The authors also discuss the application of the affine analogue of classical invariant theory to describe these equations in a bilinear form and the transition to nonlinear matrix equations.
