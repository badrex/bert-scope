tldr: A well in the Isle of Wight contained a deadly damp or sulphureous vapour that caused convulsions and death to those who entered the well. The vapour was emitted from a mineral stratum and was affected by weather conditions. The well was eventually filled up due to the danger it posed to the surrounding community.
