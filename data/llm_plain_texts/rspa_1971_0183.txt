  - Gas breakdown

  - Pre-breakdown current
  - Townsend theory
tldr: This article describes experiments on the dielectric breakdown of low density gases, specifically mercury vapor. The authors developed experimental techniques to measure pre-breakdown current growth at high values, allowing them to compute electron multiplication and secondary emission coefficients. The results confirm the theory of breakdown and pre-breakdown current growth developed in a previous paper. The study contributes to understanding the dielectric properties of gases and the behavior of electrical discharges in low pressure environments.
