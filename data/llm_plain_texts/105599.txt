tldr: The author, John Stephens, observed an unusual phenomenon in Dorsetshire where cliffs began to smoke and burn after a sudden change in weather. He discovered pyrites, marcasites, and other minerals in the cliffs and theorized that these materials, when exposed to air, water, and the elements, ignited and burned. Stephens proposed that subterranean fires, hot springs, and even earthquakes could be caused by the heat and combustion of these minerals. This observation led him to believe that these mineral flames could be detrimental or destructive to miners and that they might be responsible for volcanic-like eruptions.
