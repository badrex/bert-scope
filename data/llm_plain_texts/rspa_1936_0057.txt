tldr: The authors analyze the velocity and temperature distributions in turbulent flow along a flat plate, considering both the momentum transport and vorticity theories. They find that the temperature and velocity distributions are of the same form, assuming that fluctuating pressure gradients parallel to the main flow are negligible. The results are in good agreement with experimental data.
