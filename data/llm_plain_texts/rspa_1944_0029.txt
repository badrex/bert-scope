tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the transition effect of penetrating showers, which is crucial for understanding penetrating showers. They observed the effect and found it to agree with the theory of Hamilton, Heither, and Peng. The results showed that the transition effect is an essential factor in interpreting penetrating showers and improving previous results.
