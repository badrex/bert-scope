tldr: This article presents a rigorous theory of dispersion in granular and sintered spatially-periodic porous media. The theory calculates the Darcy-scale interstitial velocity vector and dispersivity dyadic of a tracer particle in terms of the local fluid velocity field within the interstices of a unit cell. The theory is complete, but numerical results are not yet available due to the complex structure of the local interstitial velocity field. However, it correctly reduces to the well-known Taylor-Aris results for dispersion in circular capillaries in an appropriate limiting case.
