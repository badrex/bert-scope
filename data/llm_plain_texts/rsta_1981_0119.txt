tldr: This article explores the composition and evolution of the Earth's continental crust using rare earth element evidence from sedimentary rocks. The authors find that the present-day upper crust has a granodiorite composition and that the lower crust has an Eu-enriched pattern. They also discuss the Archaean upper crust's different composition and infer its possible composition based on rare earth element patterns. The study provides insights into the growth rate of the continental crust and its evolution over time.
