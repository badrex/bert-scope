tldr: The authors conducted experiments on aromatic hydrocarbons in liquid paraffin to study phosphorescence and delayed fluorescence. They found that the intensity of delayed fluorescence varies as the square of the incident light intensity, supporting the triplet-triplet annihilation origin of delayed fluorescence. The authors also measured the decay constants of phosphorescence and delayed fluorescence, which helped confirm the triplet-triplet annihilation mechanism and provided values for triplet state lifetimes.
