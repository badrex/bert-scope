tldr: The author investigates the yellow coloration accompanying chlorophyll in plants and their spectroscopic relations. They separate and analyze the xanthophyll group, which can be further isolated using carbon bisulphide. The author observes absorption bands in the violet and ultraviolet regions and discusses the changes in the spectrum when exposed to acid or when left to stand. The study provides insights into the complex interactions between different plant pigments and their roles in photosynthesis.
