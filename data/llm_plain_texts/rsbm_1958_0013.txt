tldr: 'Ernest Laurence Kennaway was a remarkable man who made significant contributions to cancer research despite facing health challenges throughout his life. His work had a far-reaching influence on the history of cancer research. Kennaway was born in Exeter in 1881 and developed an early interest in natural history, which led to his keen sense of observation and perception. After completing his studies at University College London and New College, Oxford, he qualified in medicine in 1907. Kennaway held relatively few appointments during his career, focusing on his research in cancer. He was appointed Director of the Research Institute of the Cancer Hospital and Professor of Experimental Pathology in the University of London in 1931. Kennaway received numerous honors and distinctions for his work, including being elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and awarded a Royal Medal in 1941. He passed away on New Year's Day in 1958.'
