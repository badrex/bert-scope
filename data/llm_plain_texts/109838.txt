tldr: The author conducted experiments using a large voltaic battery with 21 cells to study the properties of various metals and materials. They found that the order of metals as conductors of electricity follows their powers to conduct heat. The battery was able to ignite different metals and fuse some materials, such as oxide of molybdena and oxide of iridium. The author also attempted to convert iron into steel using diamond powder, which appeared to be successful.
