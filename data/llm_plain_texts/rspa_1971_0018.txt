tldr: This study investigates the dissociation of the sheep haemoglobin molecule at neutral pH using osmotic pressure and sedimentation equilibrium measurements. The results show that at low ionic strength, the molecule does not significantly dissociate, while at higher ionic strength, reversible dissociation occurs. The dissociation constants increase with increasing ionic strength but remain constant after a certain point. The study also demonstrates the importance of reliable 'blank' solvent control experiments and provides insights into the behavior of sheep haemoglobin under various conditions.
