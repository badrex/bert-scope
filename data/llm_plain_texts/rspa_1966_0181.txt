tldr: The authors studied the behavior of dislocation loops in zinc and their annealing process. They found that some loops grow while others shrink, and they attributed this to the growth of zinc oxide on the foil surface and the formation of vacancies. The authors analyzed the climb rate of shrinking loops and estimated the stacking fault energy, which is crucial for understanding the material's properties. They also compared the climb rate of faulted loops with that of prismatic loops to obtain a more reliable value for the stacking fault energy in zinc.
