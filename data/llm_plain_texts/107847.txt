tldr: The author, John Dalton, presents a detailed account of a remarkable aurora borealis observed on March 29, 1826. He collected observations from various locations to determine the height of the luminous arch of the aurora. The author concludes that the aurora was not as low as previously estimated and provides a comprehensive analysis of the phenomenon's appearance and movement.
