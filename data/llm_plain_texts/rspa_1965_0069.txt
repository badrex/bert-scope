tldr: This article examines the flow of a viscous fluid past a flat plate with uniform injection. The authors study the boundary-layer equations numerically and analytically, focusing on the case where the pressure gradient is zero. They find that at high injection rates, the boundary layer becomes thick and almost inviscid, while at low injection rates, the boundary layer remains thin. The authors also explore the behavior of the solution near the point of separation and discuss the limitations of their analysis.
