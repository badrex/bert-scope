tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine if certain Tabanid flies act as carriers of Trypanosoma Pecorum, a trypanosome disease affecting domestic animals. They studied the biting flies in Uganda and found that Tabanid flies, specifically Tabanus secedens, were common carriers of the disease. The study also provided insights into the natural history and habits of these flies, which are essential for understanding the transmission of trypanosome diseases in Africa.
