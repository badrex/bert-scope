tldr: The author examines the theories behind the formation of the parallel roads in Lochaber, Scotland, and concludes that the glacial theory best explains the phenomena. The author suggests that two glaciers played a significant role in the formation of the lakes and roads, and that the area experienced a warm interglacial period between two periods of glaciation.
