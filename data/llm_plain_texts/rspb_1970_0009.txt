tldr: The author discusses the induction and control of plant growth and morphogenesis using cultured cells. They describe the use of coconut milk and other stimuli to induce growth in carrot cells and the development of techniques for growing whole plants from isolated cells. The author also explores the potential for studying plant development at the cellular level and the role of liquid endosperms in the growth of plants.
