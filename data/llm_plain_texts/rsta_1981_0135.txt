tldr: This article compares the distributions of galactic gamma radiation and radio synchrotron radiation to understand the relationship between cosmic ray densities and gas densities in the interstellar medium. The comparison provides insights into the relative distributions of cosmic rays and gas density, which may be dynamically related.
