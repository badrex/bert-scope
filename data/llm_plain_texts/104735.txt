tldr: In a letter to Mr. Roderick, Rev. Mr. Taylor, Vicar of Portsmouth, describes an earthquake experienced in Portsmouth and nearby locations on March 18, 1749-50. The earthquake was felt along the coast between East and West, with some reports from Guernsey and Jersey. The author speculates that the earthquake's small resistance at sea, compared to the resistance it would encounter underground, suggests that a more violent return may occur at sea rather than causing significant damage on land.
