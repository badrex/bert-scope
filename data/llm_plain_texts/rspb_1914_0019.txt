tldr: 'The author observed an unusual increase in the number of female Mus rattus in certain locations, particularly in Lucknow. They found that adult female rats were more likely to die or be less caught than males, leading to a skewed sex ratio. This phenomenon was temporary and quickly adjusted, but the cause of the increased female mortality remains unknown.'
