tldr: This article discusses the prevalence and evolutionary significance of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in birds. The author found evidence of widespread STDs in commercially kept birds, which may have important consequences for the evolution of behavior, reproductive physiology, and secondary sexual characteristics. STDs can affect mating systems and may explain high levels of sperm mortality after insemination. The potential for coevolutionary cycling is significant, as STDs may coevolve with female and male reproductive physiology. The author suggests that STDs should be considered as a potentially powerful factor in future studies of mate choice and sperm competition.
