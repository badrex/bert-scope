tldr: This article examines the effects of the 1975-76 drought on water balance in England and Wales through detailed studies of research catchments. The authors compare precipitation, streamflow, soil moisture, and potential evaporation during the drought period with previous seasons. They find that catchments with appreciable storage, such as those containing chalk, glacial drift, or peat, experienced less significant yield drops compared to catchments with less storage capacity. The study also highlights the importance of considering land-use changes on water resources and their impact on water supply during droughts.
