tldr: The author analyzes a ten-year parish register from Great Shefford, providing insights into birth and death rates, life expectancy, and population estimation. The study reveals that the two youngest and oldest age groups have the highest mortality rates, and suggests that rural areas may have different life expectancy rates than urban areas due to factors like access to healthcare and living conditions. The author also discusses the importance of accurate population data for public health and policy decisions.
