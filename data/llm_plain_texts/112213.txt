tldr: The author, Jacob Lockhart Clarke, examines the development stages of the spinal cord in humans, mammals, and birds. He describes the initial formation of the spinal cord as a canal surrounded by a single layer of cells. As development progresses, the spinal cord differentiates into two layers: the inner epithelium and the outer grey substance. The author also discusses the formation of nerve cells and their connections within the spinal cord and intervertebral ganglia.
