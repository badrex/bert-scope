tldr: This article discusses the nature of coordination sites of transition metals in proteins, focusing on recent protein crystallographic studies of enzymes. It highlights the importance of combining protein crystallography with spectroscopic studies, such as extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), to provide accurate interatomic distances and structural information. The article also advocates for using bond valence sum analysis and a distortional theorem to inspect the details of the geometry of metal binding sites in proteins.
