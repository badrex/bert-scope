tldr: This article discusses approximations for simple properties of a Strauss-type spatial point process with two types of points, assuming weak interactions between points and negligible boundary effects. The authors derive expansions for the reduced second moment measure used in the statistical analysis of spatial point patterns, which can be useful in estimating inter-point interactions and their ranges.
