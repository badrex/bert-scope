tldr: 'This article discusses the historical significance of Gauss's first measurement of the absolute value of magnetic intensity and its impact on the study of the Earth's core and geomagnetic field. Gauss's method, which involved simple and portable apparatus, allowed for the absolute determination of magnetic intensity and was widely applied in various parts of the world. His work laid the foundation for modern geomagnetic research and contributed to the development of various instruments for measuring the Earth's magnetic field.'
