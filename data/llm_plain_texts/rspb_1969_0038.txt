tldr: This article discusses the ultrastructure of mitochondria, focusing on their double membrane system and two distinct compartments. It also explores the implications of mitochondrial substructures, such as elementary particles and ribosome-like particles, and the presence of DNA within mitochondria. The author reviews the differences between mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, their molecular structure, and the potential for mitochondria to have some genetic functions similar to those of chromosomal DNA.
