tldr: The author investigates the effects of radiation from molten glass on glass workers' eyes and explores the development of eye-preserving glass for spectacles. They find that the main cause of eye damage is due to heat rays and recommend using a protective glass that is opaque to infra-red rays. The author also suggests that a neutral or grey tinted glass would be beneficial for eye protection.
