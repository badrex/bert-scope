tldr: In 1677, Mr. Flamstead observed and documented the appearance and movements of a comet. He shared his limited observations due to cloudy nights, but provided details on the comet's position, size, and tail. He also compared the comet's position to other stars and celestial bodies, noting its motion and trajectory.
