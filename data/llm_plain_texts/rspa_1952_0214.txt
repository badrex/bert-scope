  - Secondary electron emission

tldr: The authors developed a method to measure the secondary emission ratios at low primary electron energies using a new electron gun. They investigated the secondary electron emission from copper and silver films and found that these metals have a secondary emission ratio less than 0.1 in the primary energy range of 1 to 5 eV. The results showed that at very low energies, secondary electrons are actually elastically reflected primary electrons.
