semantic_tags:
  - Radioactivity
  - Secondary rays
  - Atomic weight
  - Radiation absorption
  - Angular dependence
tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the properties of secondary radiation emitted by substances when exposed to radium rays. They found that the secondary radiation depends on the atomic weight of the element and discovered a portion of the secondary radiation follows the ordinary law of reflection. The authors also investigated the intensity of the radiation in different directions and at various angles of incidence.
