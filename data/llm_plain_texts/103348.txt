tldr: This article discusses the discovery of an almost complete skeleton of a large animal embedded in a hard stone. The author, Dr. William Stukely, describes the process of fossilization and petrifaction, suggesting that the stone's transformation from clay to solid rock preserved the skeleton. He also speculates on the possible identity of the creature and the geological processes that led to its entombment in the stone. The author highlights the importance of studying fossils and their implications for understanding Earth's history.
