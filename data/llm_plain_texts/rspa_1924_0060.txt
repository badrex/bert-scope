tldr: The authors conducted experiments with double resonators to study the production of consonant sounds. They discovered that consonants are produced by manipulating the resonances of the vocal cavity, similar to how vowels are produced. The study suggests that all consonant sounds are essentially musical and can be imitated by reproducing their characteristic resonances in models.
