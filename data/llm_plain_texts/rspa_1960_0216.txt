tldr: This study investigates the electron energy distribution in hydrogen plasmas using the Druyvesteyn method. The research focuses on striation structure, ionization rate, and the role of high-energy electrons in maintaining ionization necessary for sustaining the discharge. The findings reveal that the concentration of high-energy electrons decreases exponentially with distance from the striation head, and the major loss of these electrons is due to inelastic collisions.
