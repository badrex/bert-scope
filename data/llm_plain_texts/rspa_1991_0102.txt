tldr: The authors discovered a new mode of forced waves in rectangular tanks, called kink cross waves, which slosh across the short side of the tank and have their profile modulated by hyperbolic-tangent envelopes. They provided a theoretical explanation for the kink wave properties and confirmed their existence through experiments. This new family of surface waves extends the parametric domain for determining the existence and stability of the modes of interest.
