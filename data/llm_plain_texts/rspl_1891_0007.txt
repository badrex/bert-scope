tldr: The author conducted experiments on himself and his assistant to study the consumption of oxygen and formation of carbonic acid during human respiration. They used a unique method to collect and analyze the expired air, finding that the ratio of oxygen consumed to carbon dioxide produced was approximately 0.91. This research helped improve the understanding of the chemical phenomena of respiration.
