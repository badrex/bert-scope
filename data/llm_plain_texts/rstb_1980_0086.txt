tldr: The article explores the concept of motion perception and its relation to spatial representation. It discusses the phenomenon of 'apparent motion,' where a target appears to move continuously even when it makes discrete spatial jumps. The author proposes that the visual system's ability to perceive motion is limited by physiological constraints and that understanding these constraints can help us better understand how the visual system processes motion.
