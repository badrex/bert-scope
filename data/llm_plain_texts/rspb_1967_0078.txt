tldr: This article explores the properties of mean fitness and its role in predicting genetic equilibria in populations with multilocus polymorphisms. The author presents and compares three fitness theorems, including those by Fisher, Kimura, and Kojima & Kelleher, and discusses their implications for understanding genetic composition and evolution in populations. The article also introduces a modified adaptive topography to account for recombination and other factors affecting fitness and genetic equilibria.
