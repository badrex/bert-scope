tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the androgenic activity of ovarian grafts in castrated male rats. They found that the normal ovary can secrete small amounts of androgenic substances, and under certain conditions, sufficient androgens can be secreted for their presence to be detectable. The results showed that all functional grafts had oestrogenic activity, and this developed more quickly than androgenic activity.
