tldr: This article discusses the use of single failure assessment lines in failure assessment diagrams, specifically focusing on the R6-O3 procedure. The authors analyze the natural mapping between the -curve analysis plane and the R6-O3 failure assessment diagram, and demonstrate how to derive implied -curves and implied applied curves from a single failure assessment line. The article also examines the consistency and conservatism of analyses of ductile tearing instability using a single failure assessment line.
