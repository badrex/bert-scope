tldr: 'The author presents a detailed method for constructing a ballistic diagram to analyze external ballistics. The diagram includes curves for velocity, time, distance, change of direction, and kinetic energy, which can be used to determine the trajectory of a projectile and its striking energy. The process involves plotting various curves and integrating them to find the desired values. The resulting diagram helps in understanding the behavior of projectiles in flight and can be used for various applications in ballistics.'
