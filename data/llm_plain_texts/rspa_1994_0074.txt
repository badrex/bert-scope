tldr: The authors present an exact representation of N-wave solutions for the non-planar Burgers equation, which describes the propagation of weakly nonlinear longitudinal waves in fluids or gases. They find that the solution tends to the inviscid solution for large initial Reynolds numbers and to the linear solution as time tends to infinity. This study compares their results with those of Crighton and Scott (1979).
