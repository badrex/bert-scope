tldr: This article examines the equilibrium diagram of the gold-indium system, providing detailed information on the various phases and structures present in the alloys. The study includes thermal, microscopical, and X-ray techniques to analyze the phases and their properties. The findings contribute to the understanding of the general theory of alloys of noble metals and provide insights into the differences between gold, copper, and silver alloys.
