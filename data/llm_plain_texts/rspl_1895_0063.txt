tldr: The author investigates the spectra of variable stars, specifically those in the 8 Cephei class, and finds that they have identical spectra and are stars of increasing temperature. The study reveals that these variables, like other classes, occupy places on the ascending arm of the temperature curve and are likely meteor-swarms not yet completely condensed.
