tldr: The authors studied the branching ratios for leaving a diatomic molecule's ion in a particular vibrational level when photoionized, focusing on the autoionizing Rydberg state converging to the B state. They found substantial differences between theoretical and experimental Franck-Condon factors near resonance and observed considerable variations in partial cross sections and photoelectron angular distributions in the region of this resonance.
