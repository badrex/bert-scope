tldr: The authors investigate the anomalous scattering of alpha particles by hydrogen and helium, using a new approach based on the interaction energy suggested by Gamow. They find that the wave function differs from the Coulombian function only by the first term of the expansion, and calculate the values of the potential field and wave functions for different incident velocities. The results provide a better understanding of the scattering process and improve the accuracy of predictions.
