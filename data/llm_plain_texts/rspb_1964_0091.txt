tldr: 'This study investigates the nervous control of optokinetic responses in the crab Carcinus. The authors found that the eyes of the crab follow a horizontally rotating striped drum with a constantly increasing lag. The control of eye movement appears to be unaffected by proprioceptors, and the initiation of the rapid flick back in the optokinetic response seems to occur when efferent impulses to eye muscles reach a threshold frequency. The main control of eye movements in the crab is by the movement and not by the position of a striped field relative to the eye.'
