tldr: This article presents the chemical composition of mixed herbage in permanent grass-land and its relation to the character and stage of growth, as well as the impact of manuring. The authors conducted experiments on a large plot of land for many years, analyzing the dry matter, nitrogen, and ash content of the crops. They found that different types of manures affected the growth and chemical composition of the herbage, with some manures promoting the growth of specific plant species. The authors also discussed the influence of season and manuring on the botanical and chemical composition of the mixed herbage.
