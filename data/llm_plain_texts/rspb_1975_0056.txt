tldr: The authors discuss the possibility that life on Earth may have originated from alien ancestors. They argue that the current understanding of life's origins, based on the idea of original biochemical similarity, is not well-supported by experimental evidence. Instead, they propose that life may have evolved from materials and processes that were different from those found in modern organisms. They also highlight the potential for synthetic, or alien, life to be created in the near future.
