tldr: The author, William Herschel, conducted extensive observations of the heavens using large telescopes and discovered a great abundance of extensive diffused nebulosity. He classified these celestial objects into various categories and found that the extent of nebulosity in the heavens was far beyond what was previously imagined. This new classification and understanding of the organization of celestial bodies shed light on the nature and construction of the universe.
