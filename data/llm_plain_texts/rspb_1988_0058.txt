tldr: 'The study investigates the hatching factor activity of monohydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid in barnacle Elminius modestus. Two bands containing hatching factor activity were identified, a monohydroxy fatty acid (MHFA) band with potent hatching factor activity and a less active trihydroxy fatty acid (THFA) band. The MHFA band mainly consists of positional isomers of monohydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid, predominantly 8-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid (8-HEPE). The findings suggest that monohydroxy isomers of eicosapentaenoic acid play a crucial role in hatching barnacle eggs.'
