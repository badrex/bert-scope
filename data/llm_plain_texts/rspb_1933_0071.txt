tldr: The authors conducted a study on the effects of surgically removing the pituitary gland in rabbits and the potential for hormone substitution therapy. They found that rabbits could survive the procedure and observed changes in behavior, body temperature, and reproductive cycles. The study also highlighted the importance of protecting hypophysectomized animals from temperature changes and the need for proper post-operative care.
