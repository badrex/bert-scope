tldr: The authors present a series solution for the transient mass dispersion problem in fully developed laminar flow in a tube. The method can be extended to more general geometries and boundary conditions, making it useful for various practical applications in heat transfer. The solution confirms the theoretical prediction of average concentration distributions and provides accurate results for local concentration distribution over a wide range of practical interest.
