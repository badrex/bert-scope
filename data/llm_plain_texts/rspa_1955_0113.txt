revised_title: 'Mayer's Theory and the Ising Problem: Approximations and Cluster Sums'

tldr: The authors explore the application of Mayer's imperfect-gas formalism to the Ising problem, focusing on cluster sums and approximations. They demonstrate how the quasi-chemical approximation can be derived from this approach and discuss the potential for further approximations based on lattice structure.
