tldr: This article explores the phenomenon of spontaneous emulsification, where oil and water mixtures form emulsions without external intervention. The authors discuss the role of molecular diffusion, surface tension, and the factors that influence the formation and stability of emulsions. They also examine the role of preformed soap in stabilizing emulsions and the potential for other substances to act as anti-emulsifiers.
