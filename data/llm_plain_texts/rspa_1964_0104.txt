tldr: The authors studied the thermal expansion of various salts of graphite, including nitrates, perchlorates, and bisulphates, using X-ray diffraction methods. They found that the thermal expansion of these salts in the c-axis direction can be as large as in the parent graphite. The three nitrates show a thermal expansion anomaly at around 200Â°C, which may be due to a phase transformation in the crystals. This research provides insights into the interaction forces between intercalates and the macro-aromatic molecules in graphite salts.
