tldr: The author, Francis Hauksbee, conducted experiments to study the ascent of spirit of wine between two glass planes. He observed that the height of the wine between the planes increased as the distance between the planes decreased. This demonstrated the effect of surface tension and capillary action on the movement of liquids.
