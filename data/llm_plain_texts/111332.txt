tldr: E. Brown Sèquard's research investigates the impact of different parts of the solar spectrum on the iris' contraction. He discovered that the yellow part of the spectrum has the most significant effect on the iris, while the other colors have little to no impact. This finding suggests that light's influence on the iris is not due to its chemical or heat properties but rather a unique dynamic force. Additionally, Sèquard found that the iris's muscular irritability can last for an extended period, even without the presence of nerves.
