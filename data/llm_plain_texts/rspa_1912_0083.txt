revised_title: Molecular Statistics of Chemical Actions: Silver and Ozone vs Copper and Active Nitrogen
semantic_tags:
  - Chemical kinetics
  - Molecular collisions
  - Ozone destruction
  - Active nitrogen
  - Copper oxide surface
tldr: The author investigates the rate of chemical reactions between gases and solid surfaces using the kinetic theory of gases. They study the interaction of ozone with silver surfaces and active nitrogen with copper oxide surfaces, measuring the number of molecular collisions required to achieve a chemical change. The results show that one collision with a silver surface is enough to destroy an ozone molecule, while an active nitrogen molecule must collide 500 times with an oxidized copper surface before being destroyed.
