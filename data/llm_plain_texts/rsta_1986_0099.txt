tldr: The authors analyze various data, including cosmic rays, X-rays, infrared, and millimeter-wave astronomy, to estimate the mass of molecular gas in the Galaxy and its distribution. They find that the surface density of molecular gas in the inner Galaxy is less than previously thought, and the total mass of molecular gas in the inner Galaxy is estimated to be around 10^9 solar masses. This new estimate has implications for understanding star formation, the chemical evolution of the interstellar medium, and the overall evolution of the Galaxy.
