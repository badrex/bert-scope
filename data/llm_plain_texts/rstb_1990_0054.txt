tldr: This article discusses the role of inositol lipids and phosphates in the regulation of growth and differentiation of haemopoietic and other cells. It explores the signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation and the effects of growth factors on these processes. The study highlights the importance of inositol lipid hydrolysis in the stimulation of quiescent cells and the involvement of tyrosine kinase oncogenes in these pathways.
