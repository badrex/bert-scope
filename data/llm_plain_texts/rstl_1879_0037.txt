tldr: 'The author, William Mitten, describes the botanical collections made in Kerguelen's Land and Rodriguez during the Transit of Venus Expeditions in 1874-75. He focuses on the thirty-three moss species found in Rodriguez, identifying ten as fertile and twenty-three as barren. Mitten discusses the unique characteristics and classifications of these mosses, comparing them to species from Africa, the Mascarene Islands, India, and the Indian Archipelago.'
