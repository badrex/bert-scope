tldr: This article discusses the long-term effects of oil pollution on marine populations, communities, and ecosystems. It highlights the impact of oil spills on intertidal and subtidal benthic communities, which can take a long time to recover and undergo slow, subtle changes. The author emphasizes the need for monitoring the community as a whole and the importance of understanding the physiological and biochemical effects of petroleum compounds on marine organisms and ecosystems.
