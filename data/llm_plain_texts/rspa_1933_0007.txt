tldr: This article investigates the photochemical conversion of ergosterol to vitamin D by examining the behavior of unimolecular ergosterol films under the influence of ultra-violet radiation. The study uses the surface potential method to investigate the alteration in the structure of the immersed polar group. The results show that after 20 minutes of irradiation, the surface potential change is almost identical to crystalline vitamin D, suggesting that the photochemical effect on ergosterol films is similar to the formation of vitamin D.
