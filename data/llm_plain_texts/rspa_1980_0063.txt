tldr: The article discusses the significant contributions made by the Gottingen school, led by Professor R. W. Pohl, to the field of solid state physics between 1920 and 1940. Pohl's research group conducted experiments on photoconductivity, crystal growth, and atomic physics, making important discoveries related to the internal photoelectric effect and the behavior of electrons in solid materials. Their work laid the foundation for future advancements in the understanding of solid state phenomena.
