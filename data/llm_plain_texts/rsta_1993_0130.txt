tldr: This article discusses mass transport and chemical reactions in Taylor-vortex flows with entrained catalytic particles, focusing on applications to a novel class of immobilized enzyme biochemical reactors. The authors analyze the behavior of solute tracers in these systems, considering factors such as molecular diffusion, interphase solute transport, and reaction rates. They derive macroscale transport equations and provide insights into the design and optimization of these reactors for efficient biocatalytic processes.
