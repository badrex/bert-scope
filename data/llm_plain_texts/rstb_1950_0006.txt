tldr: The authors conducted a study on late-glacial deposits in Cornwall, focusing on the Allerod oscillation period. They analyzed pollen samples from various sites, including Hawks Tor china-clay pits, and found evidence of plants now restricted to more northerly regions of the UK. The study also revealed a sequence of events during the late-glacial period, providing insights into the climate, vegetation, and history of the British flora.
