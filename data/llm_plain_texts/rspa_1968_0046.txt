tldr: The authors conducted a structural and magnetic study of pentachloro-bis(1,5-dithiahexane)dirhenium, a binuclear complex with rhenium atoms in a staggered rotational configuration. The compound has a mean formal oxidation state of III for the rhenium atoms, and the metal-metal bond has an order of 3. The study provides insights into the molecular and electronic structures of related compounds containing rhenium atoms in different oxidation states.
