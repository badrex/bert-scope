tldr: The Western Canada Sedimentary Basin is a large sedimentary basin that extends southwest from the Canadian Shield. Its complex history involves a foreland basin superimposed on a cratonic platform and continental terrace wedge. The basin's evolution can be outlined through six stratigraphic sequences, each representing a major transgressive-regressive megacycle. The analysis of the basin's stratigraphic record helps to understand its relation to the evolution of the Cordillera and its significance for models of basin development.
