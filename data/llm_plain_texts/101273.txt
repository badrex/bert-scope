tldr: The author, Gio. Domen Cassini, observed a recently appeared comet and shared his findings about its trajectory, size, and brightness. The comet's tail was visible for a few hours, and it was seen in various parts of Europe, but not in Paris or London. More detailed discussions about this comet will be published in the future.
