tldr: The authors studied the influence of diffusion on the current-voltage curve in a flame ionization detector. They found that diffusion dominates the current only when the applied voltage is much less than 1. The theory of the instrument using diffusion is given in one, two, and three dimensions. The experiments confirmed that the value of the current at zero voltage can be used to determine the diffusion coefficient and that the predicted value of the slope at the origin will not be found from experiments if a large voltage interval is used.
