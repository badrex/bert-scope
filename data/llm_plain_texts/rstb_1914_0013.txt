tldr: The author investigates the process of calcification in enamel and dentine, focusing on the role of calcospherites and their formation. They study the structure and development of dentine and find that calcification occurs through the dialysis of lime salts. The author also examines the calcification process in various crustaceans and mollusks, observing a distinct fibrillar basis substance that supports the material secreted by the animal. In the case of teeth, the uncalcified portion of the matrix takes stains readily, and the advancing calcification can be seen encroaching upon it in the form of rounded masses of lime salts, some of which are calcospherites.
