tldr: The authors investigate the properties of thin protein films and their behavior under compression. They develop a method to create uniform protein monolayers and study the structure and mechanical properties of these films. The research focuses on gliadin, a protein that spreads readily and has a simple hydrolysis profile, revealing its composition of amino acids. The findings contribute to understanding protein films and their potential applications in various fields.
