tldr: The authors study the effects of enthalpy gradient on one-dimensional laminar flame propagation. They find that a positive enthalpy gradient increases the flame speed, while a negative gradient decreases it to zero. The results are discussed for various scenarios, including flow of combustible gas into a hot or cold plug, the'sandwich burner,' radiative heat loss, and burning of a condensed-phase propellant. The study provides insights into the behavior of flames in different conditions and has practical implications for various applications.
