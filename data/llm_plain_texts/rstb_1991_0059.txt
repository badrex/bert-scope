tldr: This study examines the lung morphologies of four bat species, Phyllostomus hastatus, Pteropus lylei, Pteropus alecto, and Pteropus poliocephalus, to understand the relationship between pulmonary structure and function. The researchers found that smaller bats have morphometrically superior lungs compared to non-flying mammals, but larger bats are generally inferior to birds in terms of lung performance. The study provides more representative allometric equations for bats, allowing for a better understanding of the influence of body size on bat lung morphology and function.
