tldr: The authors studied the absorption of light by gaseous, liquid, and solid xenon, one of the inert gases. They found that the resonance wavelengths of the inert gases fall below the spectral region covered by a quartz-spectrograph. The study provides insights into the unique and fundamental frequency associated with resonance frequencies in metal films and the absorption of light by different states of xenon.
