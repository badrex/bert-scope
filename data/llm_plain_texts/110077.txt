tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the velocity of sound in Holland using advanced equipment and techniques. They selected two open and elevated spots in the plains of Utrecht, and measured the interval between seeing a light signal and hearing the sound using clocks with conical pendulums. They also used barometers, thermometers, and hygrometers to measure atmospheric conditions. The results showed that at a temperature of 32Â°F, the velocity of sound is 1,089-7,445 English feet per sexagesimal second.
