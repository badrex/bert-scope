tldr: The article explores the properties of equilateral triangles inscribed in circles and compares their sizes to other triangles that can be inscribed within the same circle. It demonstrates that an equilateral triangle is larger than any other inscribed triangle and smaller than any other triangle described about the same circle. The article also provides a proof that the square of an equilateral triangle's side is equal to a rectangle under the diameter of the circle and a perpendicular drawn from any angle to the opposite side.
