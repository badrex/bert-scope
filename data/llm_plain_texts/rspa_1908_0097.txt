tldr: The author investigates the propagation of groups of waves in dispersive media, with a focus on water waves produced by a traveling disturbance. Using Fourier analysis, the author demonstrates how waves can be represented as a collection of simple groups and discusses the implications for understanding wave behavior in various scenarios.
