tldr: The author describes an apparatus for performing electro-magnetic experiments using two plates, one of copper and the other of zinc. The plates are rolled around a wooden cylinder and are counterpoised and suspended over a tub of acid. When immersed in the acid and connected by a conductor, the apparatus affects magnetic needles and confers magnetism on steel bars. The electric intensity of the apparatus is weak.
