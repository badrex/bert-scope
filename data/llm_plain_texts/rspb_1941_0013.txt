tldr: 'The authors discovered that visual purple, a protein found in the retina, can be studied at low temperatures using a glycerol-water solution. They found that the absorption spectrum of visual purple at low temperatures is different from that at room temperature, with a higher and narrower peak shifted towards longer wavelengths. The photodecomposition of visual purple at low temperatures produces a primary product, transient orange, which is stable and does not decompose thermally. The quantum yields of the photoreaction at low and room temperatures are of the same order.'
