tldr: This article compares the geophysical properties of oceans and continents, focusing on the differences in their structures and compositions. The author discusses the findings from seismic and gravity studies, which suggest that deep ocean basins have distinct characteristics from continents and cannot have been part of them. The article also explores the possibility of the gradual growth of continents and the nature of materials beneath the Mohorovicic discontinuity on land and at sea.
