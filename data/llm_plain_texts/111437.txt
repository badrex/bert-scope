tldr: 'The article discusses the enumeration of partitions in r-pyramids, specifically focusing on the first class of r-gonous x-edra. It explains the process of creating partitions by drawing diagonals and diapeds without crossing each other. The author provides formulas to determine the number of partitions in terms of r-gon and r-ace partitions. However, the article states that further classification for the second and higher classes of partitions is too complex for practical application.'
