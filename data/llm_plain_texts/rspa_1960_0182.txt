tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the scattering of 29 MeV 3He-particles and observed angular distributions for elastic scattering and inelastic processes involving 2H, 3He, and 4He nuclei. They compared their findings with predictions based on resonating group theory and discussed the importance of exchange properties in nuclear interactions.
