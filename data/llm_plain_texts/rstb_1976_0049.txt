tldr: 'The article reviews the United Kingdom's contribution to the International Biological Programme, focusing on photosynthesis and solar energy conversion. The research aimed to evaluate the role of solar radiation in determining the accumulation of dry matter by terrestrial species and how photosynthetic products are utilized for growth and development. The study examined the effects of radiation and temperature on plant growth components and the interrelationships between density and leaf area index on productivity. The findings showed that seasonal changes in plant growth were largely determined by the interactions of solar radiation and temperature.'
