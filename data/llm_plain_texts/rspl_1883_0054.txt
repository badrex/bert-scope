tldr: The author investigates the properties of a hollow vortex in an incompressible fluid, lined with an interior layer of different density than the surrounding fluid. They explore the steady motion and vibrations of these vortices, providing mathematical expressions for their velocity, energy, and time of vibration. This research connects to the vortex atom theory and the explanation of spectral lines of elements.
