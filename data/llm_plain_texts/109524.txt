tldr: 'The author, H. Leigh Thomas, provides a detailed description of the external and internal anatomy of a male rhinoceros. The paper includes a recapitulation of previous work on the animal's external parts and an extensive description of its internal organs. Notably, the author discusses the unique structure of the rhinoceros's eye, which has four processes that help adapt its vision for different distances. This information is useful for both anatomists and physiologists studying the rhinoceros.'
