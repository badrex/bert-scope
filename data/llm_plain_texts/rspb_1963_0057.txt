tldr: The authors investigated the structure and relations of optic nerves as they enter the optic lobes and synapse in the plexiform layer in Octopus and Eledone using electron microscopy. They observed that each optic nerve contains several bundles of axons with varicosities along their length. The axons enter the optic lobe, running between granule cells to synapse in the plexiform zone. The study provides insights into the organization of the cephalopod nervous system.
