tldr: This study investigates the role of body fluid in the burrowing movements of the lugworm Arenicola. The researchers measured the hydrostatic pressure developed in the coelomic fluid during various phases of activity, particularly during burrowing. They found that the forces available to the worms are insufficient for straightforward burrowing, and their ability to burrow depends on the thixotropic properties of the muddy sand in which they live.
