tldr: The authors developed a new method to measure the polarization of radio echoes and study the structure of the ionosphere. They used a combination of frequency change technique and pulse method, which allowed them to identify the polarization and angle of incidence of downcoming radio waves. This method provided a better understanding of the complex ionosphere and its ability to reflect radio waves.
