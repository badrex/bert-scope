tldr: The author examines the foci of lines seen through crystalline plates, focusing on the refraction of light in minerals with different structures. They explain how to determine the indices of refraction accurately and describe anomalies found in specific specimens. The study agrees with the theory of wave optics and has practical applications in the identification of minerals.
