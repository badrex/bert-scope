tldr: This article investigates the sound generated aerodynamically by large-scale structures in turbulent jets. The authors propose that these structures are responsible for the directional and spectral behavior of the aerodynamic sound field. They find that the radiation patterns of the modes resemble those of longitudinal and lateral quadrupoles, and that the peak radiation frequency in the forward direction is influenced by the jet exit velocity. The study confirms that Lighthill's formulation of the aerodynamic sound problem can explain major features of observations when considering the growing and decaying large-scale coherent eddies as sources.
