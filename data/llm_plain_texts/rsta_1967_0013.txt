tldr: This article discusses the advanced method of energy conversion through magnetohydrodynamic power generation. It focuses on the flow of current in a cross-connected generator with four electrodes and presents a two-dimensional analysis using a Schwarz-Christoffel transformation. The study helps determine the optimal electrode spacing to minimize leakage current and improve generator efficiency.
