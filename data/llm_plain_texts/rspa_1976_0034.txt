tldr: This article reports measurements of plasma density in a thermally produced plasma and presents a floating electrostatic sheath theory that predicts an enhanced plasma density. The theory is based on the existence of a floating sheath at the cavity entrance and is compared with experimental results, showing good agreement. The findings contribute to the understanding of plasma behavior and boundary conditions in thermally produced plasmas.
