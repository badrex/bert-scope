tldr: The author, Thomas Knight, presents a new method for expanding and calculating coefficients of multinomial functions. This approach offers a different perspective from previous works by M. Arboogast and simplifies the process of finding coefficients in multinomial expansions. The method is demonstrated through various examples and rules, providing a more efficient and accessible way to tackle mathematical problems involving multinomial functions.
