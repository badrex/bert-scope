tldr: The authors conducted an experiment to study the transmission patterns of anther-smut fungus, Ustilago violacea, in Silene alba plants. They found that spore deposition increased with the frequency of diseased individuals, suggesting that the transmission of the disease is frequency-dependent rather than density-dependent. This has implications for understanding disease transmission and coevolution in host-pathogen relationships.
