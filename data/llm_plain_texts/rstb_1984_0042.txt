tldr: 'This article explores the effects of varying mineralization levels in bone on its mechanical properties, such as the Young modulus of elasticity, bending strength, and work of fracture. The author demonstrates that different degrees of mineralization lead to different sets of mechanical properties, which are adaptive in most cases. The article also discusses the challenges in modeling the mechanical behavior of bone and the need for further research to understand the relationship between mineral content and bone properties.'
