tldr: This article discusses the recognition of protein antigens by T-lymphocytes and the response to these antigens. It focuses on the role of T-cell surface molecules, such as the T-cell antigen receptor, CD3 antigen, and CD2 antigen, in the immune response. The interaction of CD2 with LFA-3, a cell-adhesion molecule, plays a crucial role in the interaction of T cells with antigen-presenting cells.
