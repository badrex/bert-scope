tldr: The article discusses the potential benefits of understanding low-temperature biology and environmental studies for improving cryopreservation techniques and creating cold-resistant crop plants. It highlights the importance of studying natural systems, such as desiccation-resistant and halophilic organisms, to develop novel cryopreservation methods. The author also emphasizes the limitations of genetic manipulation in enhancing plant cold hardiness and suggests that alternative approaches, such as understanding the biochemical basis of injury, may be more effective in protecting crops from low temperatures.
