tldr: This study investigates the rate at which oxygen combines with reduced hemoglobin. The authors developed methods to measure the velocity of oxygen combining with both physically and chemically reduced hemoglobin. They found that the rate of combination depends on the concentration of dissolved oxygen and the temperature, and that the number of tonometers used affects the accuracy of the observations.
