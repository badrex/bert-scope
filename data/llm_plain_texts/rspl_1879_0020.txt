tldr: The author studied the spectrum of sodium under new experimental conditions and found that the vapour given off from the metal after slow distillation in a vacuum showed the red and green lines without any trace of the yellow one. This research has implications for understanding the behavior of substances at high temperatures and pressures, which is important for internal ballistics studies.
