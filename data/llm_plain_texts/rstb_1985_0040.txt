tldr: This article discusses the concept of endogenous antinociception and its role in modulating nociceptive inputs. The role of descending pathways, neurotransmitter candidates, and the nature of inhibitions were examined. The involvement of different neurotransmitters, particularly endogenous opioids, was also a focus of the discussion. The article highlights the complexity of pain research and the need for further investigation into the mechanisms of pain perception and modulation.
