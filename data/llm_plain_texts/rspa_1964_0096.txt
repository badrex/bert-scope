tldr: The authors developed a friction technique to study the microtopography of various surfaces by examining the contact area and deformation of surface asperities. They tested the method on different surfaces, including abraded steel and Perspex, and found that it could provide a general quantitative index of roughness and, in some cases, the average geometry of the asperities.
