tldr: This article describes a medical case study of a family in Wattisham, Suffolk, where all members, except the father, experienced severe pain and mortification of their limbs. The disease progressed rapidly, affecting both legs in most cases, and resulted in the amputation of several limbs. Despite the unusual nature of the outbreak, the family's overall health remained unaffected, and no clear cause for the disease was identified.
