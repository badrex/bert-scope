tldr: This article discusses the experiments conducted on various animals to understand the rhythm of the mammalian heart. The author found that the rhythm of the heart is mainly determined by the myogenic power of the terminal parts of the great veins, auricles, and ventricles. The author also studied the effects of vagus nerve stimulation and section on the heart's action, discovering that the controlling influence of the medullary cardio-inhibitory center plays a significant role in the heart's rhythm.
