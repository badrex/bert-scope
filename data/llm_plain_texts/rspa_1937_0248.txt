tldr: This article discusses the penetration of particles into regions of negative kinetic energy using the method of geometrical optics. It shows that in multi-dimensional problems, an upper limit for the probability of penetration can be derived, and in some cases, the method provides the actual value of this probability. The study focuses on the behavior of particles in potential fields and the wave function, using the Hamilton-Jacobi equation to analyze the lines of steepest gradient and determine the probability density at specific points.
