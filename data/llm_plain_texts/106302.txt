tldr: The author, John Whitehurst, conducted experiments on ignited substances and the weight of heated metals. He found that his experiments contradicted Buffon's findings, suggesting that the increase in weight of heated iron might be due to the iron acquiring some properties of steel. Whitehurst also proposed a possible explanation for the error in Buffon's experiment, which could be due to the difference in expansion of the beam from which the iron hung.
