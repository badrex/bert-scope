tldr: The authors used an anticoincidence method to study penetrating cosmic ray showers and discovered two types: local penetrating showers and extensive penetrating showers. Local showers are groups of mesons produced in absorbers near the apparatus by single fast primary nucleons, while extensive showers are large cascade showers containing penetrating particles. This separation helps to better understand the properties and origins of penetrating showers.
