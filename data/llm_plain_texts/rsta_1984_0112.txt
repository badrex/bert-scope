tldr: This article discusses the development of all-optical logic elements in integrated optical waveguides, focusing on a proposed traveling-wave all-optical waveguide device that can operate as an AND gate, OR gate, XOR gate, or as an inverter. The device operates in the "pipeline mode," processing a stream of pulses continuously and offering unique processing capabilities. The authors present experimental results obtained with a device fabricated in GaAs that performed as a picosecond all-optical waveguide modulator.
