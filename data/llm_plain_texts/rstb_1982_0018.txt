tldr: This article examines nitrogen cycling in United Kingdom forests and the relevance of basic ecological research. It explores the processes of decomposition and mobilization of nitrogen in forest ecosystems, emphasizing the importance of these processes for forest management and long-term site fertility. The study highlights the need for further research on nutrient release from organic matter in relation to crop demand.
