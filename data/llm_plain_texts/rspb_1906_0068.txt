tldr: The authors discuss the importance of understanding the variations in blood viscosity and its impact on the circulatory system and various pathological conditions. They review previous research on blood viscosity and present their own experiments to develop a viscosimeter for clinical use. The authors emphasize the significance of accurate physical methods for testing blood viscosity and determining the relationship between the number of corpuscles and viscosity.
