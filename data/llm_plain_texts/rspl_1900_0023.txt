tldr: The authors conducted experiments using a stereoscope and spectroscopes to study the effects of simultaneous color contrast on visual perception. They discovered that the complementary color to red consists of at least two color sensations: green and violet. The study supports Hering's contention that contrast phenomena originate in the eye rather than in the mind.
