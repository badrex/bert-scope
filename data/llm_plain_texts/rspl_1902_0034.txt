tldr: Guglielmo Marconi developed a magnetic detector of electric waves that could be used as a receiver for space telegraphy. The detector works by using the decrease of magnetic hysteresis in iron when exposed to high-frequency or Hertzian waves. Marconi successfully used this detector in wireless telegraphy experiments between St. Catherine's Point and North Haven, and between Poldhu and North Haven, covering distances of up to 152 miles.
