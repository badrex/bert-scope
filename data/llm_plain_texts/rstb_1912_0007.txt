tldr: The author examines the anatomy of the Silurian brittlestar Lapworthura miltoni and compares it to other Palaeozoic Ophiuroidea. They find that Lapworthura conforms to a similar structure found in other Silurian and Devonian Ophiurids, suggesting a need for a new classification of the Ophiuroidea. The study also reveals that the madreporite, a unique feature of echinoderms, is actinal in position in Lapworthura, providing insights into the evolution of this class.
