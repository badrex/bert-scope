tldr: This study investigates the host selection and oviposition behavior of hymenopterous parasites in the moth Plutella maculipennis. The researchers found that the presence of the silken cocoon surrounding the pupa plays a significant role in the acceptance and parasitization of the host. The females prefer to insert their ovipositor at one of the apertures in the cocoon and show a preference for the head region of the pupa. The study provides insights into the factors influencing multiple parasitism and the potential impact on biological control efforts.
