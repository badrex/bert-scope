tldr: This article discusses the development of habitats in the post-Glacial period in the Lake District, focusing on the interpretation of post-Glacial vegetation diversities at different sites. The author examines the effects of human activities, such as the clearance of primary forests and soil changes, on the development of new habitats. The study also explores the vegetation changes resulting from soil acidification by leaching, which leads to peat formation. The author concludes that human activities, such as the exploitation of elm trees for fodder, played a significant role in the decline of elm forests and the subsequent changes in the region's vegetation.
