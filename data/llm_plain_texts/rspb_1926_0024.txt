tldr: The study investigates the life cycle of Bacillus radicicola, a nodule organism, in soil and its relation to the infection of the host plant. The research discovers that the organism undergoes a regular cycle in the soil, with changes in the relative numbers of cell types being influenced by environmental factors such as the inoculating fluid. The findings highlight the importance of understanding the life cycle of soil bacteria and their response to environmental changes.
