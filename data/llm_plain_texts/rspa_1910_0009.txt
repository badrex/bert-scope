tldr: This article investigates the properties of thallium-zinc sulphate and selenate crystals, focusing on their morphology, angles, and density. The study reveals that thallium's position in the alkali metal series is not proportional to its atomic weight. The research contributes to the understanding of the monoclinic series of double salts containing thallium.
