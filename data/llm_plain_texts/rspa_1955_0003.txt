tldr: The authors analyze the colors and magnetic properties of hydrated iron group salts and propose that discrepancies between experimental data and crystal field theory can be explained by introducing weak covalent bonds between the paramagnetic ion and water molecules, suggesting a more complex bonding mechanism than purely ionic interactions.
