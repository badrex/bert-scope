  - Neurotoxins

  - Phospholipase A2

  - Transmitter release
tldr: The study investigates the effect of bee venom phospholipase A2 on the action of P-bungarotoxin, a neurotoxin that blocks acetylcholine release from motor nerve terminals. It shows that bee venom phospholipase A2 prevents the neurotoxin from blocking transmitter release, suggesting a potential therapeutic application for bee venom in treating neurotoxin-induced conditions.
