tldr: This article discusses the transport and distribution of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in the North Sea. The authors present field observations and model simulations to understand the mass balance of SPM, which is influenced by input from rivers, atmosphere, and adjacent seas, as well as deposition and resuspension at the sea bottom. The study aims to develop a verified three-dimensional transport model to interpret existing data and make reliable scenario calculations.
