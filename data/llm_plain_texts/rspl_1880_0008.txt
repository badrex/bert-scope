tldr: This article investigates the chemical composition of aleurone-grains in various plant species. It identifies four main substances found in these grains: vegetable peptone, myosin, vitellin-globulins, and a substance similar to the crystalloids of Ricinus. The study classifies aleurone-grains into five types based on their solubility in water and salt solutions. The findings contribute to our understanding of plant proteins and their functions.
