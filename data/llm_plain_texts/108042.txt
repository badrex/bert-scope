tldr: The author compares the brain structures of Europeans, Negroes, and Orang-Outangs, examining their size, weight, and dimensions. They find that the human brain is larger than that of other animals but not necessarily larger relative to body size. The author also discusses the relationship between brain size and intellectual powers, noting the small brain size in cases of congenital idiocy.
