tldr: This study investigates the mechanism of water absorption by plant roots, focusing on the effects of hydrostatic pressure gradients. The researchers used tomato plants in water culture to test the impact of pressure on water movement through the root cortex. They found that pressure differences caused a greater rate of water movement than corresponding differences in osmotic potential, suggesting that mass flow may play a role in addition to diffusion. This work provides a foundation for understanding root function in water and nutrient absorption.
