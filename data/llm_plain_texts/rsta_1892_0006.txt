revised_title: 'Exploration of Repulsion and Rotation in Alternating Electric Currents'
semantic_tags:
  - Electromagnetism
  - Alternating Currents
  - Electromagnetic Induction
  - Electromagnetic Force
  - Electromagnetic Rotation
tldr: 'The author discusses the phenomenon of repulsion and rotation produced by alternating electric currents. They explain how the difference in effective periods during repulsion and attraction leads to a greater preponderating repulsion. The author also explores the use of this repulsion in creating a meter for alternating currents and the effect of various factors on the resulting couples.'
