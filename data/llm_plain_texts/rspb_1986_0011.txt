tldr: The authors developed a stochastic modeling approach to study the behavior of single ion channels, focusing on the interdependence of burst length and the number of openings per burst. They analyzed two simple three-state models, one for an agonist-only mechanism and one for channel blocking, and derived joint distributions, conditional distributions, and associated mean values. The study showed that experimental estimates of the unconditional mean number of openings per burst may be biased if bursts of only short duration are collected.
