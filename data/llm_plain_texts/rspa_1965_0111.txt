tldr: The authors conducted an eigenmotion analysis of flows around dihedral angles, using complex equations of motion to study viscous fluid motions. They found that complex laminar flows can be described by complex dependent variables and that certain properties of real integrals of the complex Navier-Stokes equations can be used to analyze flow patterns around leading and trailing edges of dihedral angles.
