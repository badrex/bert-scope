tldr: This study examines the response rate of subpolar North Atlantic surface waters to climatic change during the Devensian (Last) cold stage. The authors analyze oceanic sediments to understand the changes in sea-surface temperature and the movement of the polar front during different intervals of time. They find that changes in sea-surface temperature can occur in a few thousand years, with average cooling or warming rates of 1-5Â°C/1000 years. These rates are important for understanding the ocean's response to climate change and the impact on the Earth's geologic record.
