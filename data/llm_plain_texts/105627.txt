tldr: A young boy experienced hearing loss after the malleus and incus bones in both ears dropped out due to a severe fever and inflammation. The boy could still be affected by loud noises but was deemed unlikely to recover his hearing. The cause was believed to be an abscess affecting the tympanum, possibly due to a malignant or ulcerous sore throat.
