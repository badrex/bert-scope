tldr: The author examines the gizzards of birds that feed on grass, comparing them to those of the turkey, which feeds on a different type of food. The gizzards of grass-feeding birds have a unique structure that allows them to digest fibrous plant material. The gizzard's cavity is flattened with curved surfaces that grind the food, and the horny covering is rough and strong. Additionally, the author observes an enlargement in the lower part of the oesophagus, which he believes serves as a reservoir for macerating and preparing grass for digestion.
