tldr: The author investigates the role of subcompartments within the Golgi complex in protein intracellular transport using a rat IgM myeloma. They analyze the effects of perturbations in cellular Na+-K+ balance on the transport of secretory and membrane glycoproteins and study the composition of the Golgi complex and its subcompartments through analytical subcellular fractionation. The findings provide insights into the divisibility of the Golgi complex and its potential role in intracellular transport.
