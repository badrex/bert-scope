tldr: The authors use mathematical models to analyze sperm precedence in zebra finches and find that measured rates of sperm disappearance and differences in sperm numbers in successive ejaculates can account for levels of sperm precedence. Special mechanisms of sperm competition, such as displacement or stratification of sperm, are not necessary to explain sperm precedence in this species.
