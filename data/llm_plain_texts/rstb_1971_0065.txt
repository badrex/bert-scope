tldr: The authors used immunological techniques to demonstrate macromolecules in sympathetic neurons, specifically focusing on chromogranin A and dopamine Î²-hydroxylase. They found that these macromolecules are transported from the cell body to the nerve terminals, providing evidence for a process of exocytosis in synaptic transmission.
