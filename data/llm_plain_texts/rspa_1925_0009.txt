tldr: This article discusses the study of metal properties, particularly steel, through tensile testing. The authors use the Dalby Autographic Load-Extension Recorders to analyze the behavior of metals under load and extension. They introduce the concept of "recoverable slip" and propose mean loop width as a measure of this property. The research shows that permanent set, or plastic deformation, is the ultimate cause of rupture in metals, and that recoverable slip is an inherent physical property of the metal.
