tldr: The authors describe a novel experimental technique for investigating stimulated scattering in liquid media using Bragg reflexion of light. They analyze the modulations of dielectric constant generated by stimulated scattering of light from a ruby laser in various liquid media using a continuous argon ion laser. The results indicate that this technique allows for a comprehensive investigation of the scattering phenomenon and is particularly suitable for studying temporal and spatial variations of the modulations.
