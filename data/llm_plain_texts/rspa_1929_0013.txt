tldr: This article presents an analysis of the band spectra of alkaline earth halides, specifically barium fluoride (BaF) and magnesium fluoride (MgF). The authors discuss the structure and properties of these molecules, including their electronic transitions and vibrational constants. They also compare their findings to previous studies on related molecules and discuss the implications of their results for the understanding of molecular spectra.
