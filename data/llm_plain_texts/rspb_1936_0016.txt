tldr: The study investigates the relationship between the respiration rate of potatoes and the concentration of sugars, particularly sucrose, at different temperatures. The research finds that respiration is not directly related to the hexose sugars, glucose, and fructose, but is connected to the changes in sucrose concentration. The findings also reveal that low temperature depression affects the respiration rate and sugar concentration in potatoes.
