tldr: The author investigates the formation of solids at low temperatures, particularly focusing on solid hydrogen. They conducted experiments to determine if solid hydrogen forms definite crystals or if it is a pseudo-solid. The results suggest that solid hydrogen is a crystalline substance, and the sharpness of its formation and constant melting pressure provide evidence in favor of this conclusion.
