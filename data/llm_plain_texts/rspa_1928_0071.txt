tldr: This article presents an experimental study of the thermal conductivities of oxygen and nitrogen gases. The authors used a unique apparatus to measure the thermal conductivity at different temperatures and pressures. They found that the thermal conductivity of oxygen is higher than that of nitrogen, which is useful for understanding heat transfer in gaseous mixtures like air. The study also discusses the purification methods used for the gases.
