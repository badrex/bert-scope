tldr: The author acknowledges the work of Academician A. I. Mal'cev, whose paper almost completely anticipates the results of Neumann & Taylor (1963) on subsemigroups of nilpotent groups. There is a slight difference between Mal'cev's laws and the author's, as Mal'cev's contain an additional, superfluous variable.
