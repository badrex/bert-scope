tldr: This article explores the relationship between life and the production of entropy, suggesting that living communities increase the rate of entropy production compared to non-living systems. The authors propose a working hypothesis and outline three propositions to support this idea, including the role of positive feedback and the evolution of heterotrophy. They also discuss the potential application of the economic theory of discounting to estimate the value of stored energy and materials in ecosystems.
