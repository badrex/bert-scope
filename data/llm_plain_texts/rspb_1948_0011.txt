tldr: The authors synthesized carbinolamines derived from 6:7-dimethylquinoline and tested their antiplasmodial activity on Plasmodium relictum in canaries. Three of the compounds, containing the 2-phenyl-6:7-dimethylquinoline nucleus, showed superior antiplasmodial activity compared to quinine. The results do not support the view that riboflavin-antagonism plays a significant role in the mechanism of action of these active bases.
