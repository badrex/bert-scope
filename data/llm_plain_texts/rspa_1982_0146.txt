tldr: The authors report an improvement in the precision of polarized neutron diffraction data for the CoCl4 ion, allowing them to analyze the data using a chemically based model of the spin-density distribution. They confirm the main features of the spin- and charge-density distributions and interpret the experimental parameters in terms of the wavefunction. The study provides insights into the spin density and bonding in the CoCl4 ion.
