tldr: This article discusses the origin, composition, and potential effects of EDC-tar, a waste product from vinyl chloride production, on marine ecosystems. The authors analyze the chemical composition of EDC-tar and find that it contains 80 different substances, many of which are chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons. They also investigate the effects of EDC-tar on phytoplankton and marine animals, finding that even low concentrations can cause acute biological effects. The authors raise concerns about the potential long-term effects of EDC-tar on marine life and the environment.
