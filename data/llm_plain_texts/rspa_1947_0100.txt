tldr: The authors study the ultraviolet absorption spectra of benzene and its derivatives, focusing on the electronic transitions and molecular orbitals involved. They identify two Rydberg series and discuss the effects of alkyl substitution on the spectra. The findings provide insights into the electronic structure and bonding of benzene and related compounds.
