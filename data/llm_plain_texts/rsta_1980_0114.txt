tldr: 'This study investigates the impact of dopant elements on the recrystallization, grain growth, and high-temperature creep behavior of tungsten and molybdenum wires. The research uses transmission electron microscopy and resistively heated specimens to analyze the effects of dopant elements such as titanium and thoria on the materials. The findings provide insights into the properties of tungsten and molybdenum wires and their potential applications.'
