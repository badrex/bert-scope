tldr: Researchers discovered that by increasing the cerebral concentrations of phosphate and divalent transition metal ions in normal mice, they could make them prone to sound-induced epilepsy. The study found that the levels of aspartate and glutamate in the inferior colliculus were elevated, while the level of GABA was diminished in these treated mice. This research suggests that a small excess in PLP and divalent transition-metal ions in the brain may be one of the causative agents in rendering the brain hyperexcitable.
