revised_title: The Role of Amyloid Substance in Liver Function and Development
semantic_tags:
  - Amyloid substance
  - Liver function
  - Tissue development
  - Nitrogen metabolism
  - Proteic compounds
tldr: The author investigates the role of the amyloid substance in the liver and its connection to the development of tissues in the body. They found that the amyloid substance is not normally converted into sugar and instead, it plays a role in the formation of nitrogenous compounds in the liver. This substance is also present in various tissues during embryonic development, suggesting its importance in tissue growth and evolution. The liver may be a crucial organ in forming proteic compounds for the adult body, similar to the role of amyloid substance in muscle tissue development.
