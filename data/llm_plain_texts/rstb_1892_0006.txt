tldr: The author investigates the ginger-beer plant, a mysterious agent used for fermentation, and discovers that it is composed of yeast and bacteria. The plant's lumps have various physical characteristics and can cause fermentation when placed in saccharine solutions. The resulting ginger-beer is acidic, viscous, and froths over due to the evolution of gas. The author also notes the presence of yeast cells, swollen vermiform bodies, and bacteria in the fermentation process.
