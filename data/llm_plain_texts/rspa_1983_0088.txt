tldr: The author examines the significance of quantum mechanical effects on the short time development of the Landau equation using the density diagram technique of Prigogine and Balescu. The analysis focuses on weakly coupled gases and compares classical and quantum terms in the solution. The study finds that quantum mechanical effects may become significant at a number density around, which is the lower bound in density that an earlier analysis suggested.
