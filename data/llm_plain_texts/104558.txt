tldr: This article presents a catalog of the immersions and emersions of Jupiter's satellites in the year 1750, computed to the Meridian of London from the Flamsteedian Tables. The author, James Hodgson, discusses the importance of observing these events for determining longitudes and improving the accuracy of astronomical tables. He encourages others to share their observations to help refine these tables.
