tldr: The authors conducted experiments using high-velocity positive ions to further study the disintegration of boron. They discovered two homogeneous groups of alpha particles and two continuous energy distributions resulting from nuclear reactions. The findings support the hypothesis that these transmutations involve the interaction of boron with deuterons and the release of alpha particles and other particles.
