tldr: The authors used the calcium indicator dye arsenazo III to measure calcium transients in frog muscle during depolarization. They found that intracellular free calcium rises during a twitch and examined the relationship between membrane potential and calcium release. The results indicate that calcium in the bathing solution does not significantly contribute to calcium transients during single twitches.
