tldr: In 1863, the Royal Society discussed the establishment of a telescope in Melbourne, Australia, for observing nebulae and multiple stars in the Southern Hemisphere. They also considered the potential of a telescope at a high elevation site for better observations. Additionally, the Society supported pendulum experiments in Russia and discussed the development of spectroscopy for studying the chemical nature of star atmospheres. The Society's work in these areas highlights its role in advancing scientific knowledge and collaboration.
