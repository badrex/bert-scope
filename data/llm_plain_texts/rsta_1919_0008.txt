tldr: The author investigates the crystallographic and optical properties of monoclinic double selenates of the iron group, focusing on potassium ferrous selenate. They describe the challenges faced during the research, such as the instability of the crystals and the difficulty in obtaining clear measurements. The author presents the crystal forms, optical constants, and density measurements of the selenates, providing valuable insights into their properties.
