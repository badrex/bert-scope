tldr: This paper presents a theoretical solution to Lagrange's problem in hydrodynamics, which involves the motion of a gas in a tube with two movable pistons. The authors discuss the generation of progressive and compound waves, as well as the reflection and interaction of these waves with the pistons. The paper also provides methods for determining the coefficients and properties of these waves, with a focus on the first and second middle waves and their reflections.
