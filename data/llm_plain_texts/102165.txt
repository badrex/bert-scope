tldr: The author investigates the petrifying properties of Lough-Neagh, a lake in Ireland, and concludes that the water does not have the ability to petrify wood. Instead, the author suggests that the soil surrounding the lake is responsible for the petrification of wood found in the area. The author provides evidence of this through various experiments and observations, including the discovery of petrified wood and stones in the soil and the examination of trees that have been buried in the mud of the lake.
