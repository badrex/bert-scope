tldr: The authors conducted molecular orbital calculations to study the photochemistry of stilbene. They found that the lowest triplet state becomes the most stable when the molecule is twisted, and the electron distribution in this state is equivalent to separation into two benzyl systems. The potential energy diagrams provide a satisfactory explanation for the ultraviolet and fluorescent spectra, as well as the mechanisms of thermal, photochemical, and photosensitized isomerization reactions.
