tldr: This study investigates the relationship between the anterior pituitary body and gonads, specifically the ovary. The authors explore the effects of different extracts and dilutions on ovary stimulation and maturation. They conclude that two hormones are involved in these processes and discuss the implications of their findings for understanding the complex nature of hormonal regulation in the female reproductive system.
