tldr: The authors conducted experiments using a Wilson chamber to photograph artificial disintegration collisions of elements. They focused on nitrogen, argon, and oxygen gases, observing eight collisions where a proton was ejected and the alpha particle was captured. The results provided evidence for the disintegration of elements and the energy changes involved in these processes.
