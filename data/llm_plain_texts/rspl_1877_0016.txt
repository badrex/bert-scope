tldr: This study investigates the friction between surfaces moving at low speeds, focusing on the relationship between velocity and the coefficient of friction. The authors found that in certain cases, the coefficient of friction increases as the velocity decreases. This suggests a continuity between static and kinetic friction, challenging the common belief that they are distinct and independent phenomena.
