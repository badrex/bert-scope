revised_title: 'Isotope Effects on Repulsive Forces Between Molecules'
semantic_tags:
  - Isotopes
  - Molecular forces
  - Coulomb forces
  - Nuclear masses
  - Virial coefficients
tldr: The author explores the impact of nuclear masses on the repulsive forces between isotopic molecules, specifically focusing on Coulomb repulsion. They develop a simple model to estimate the isotope effect and suggest that this effect could be measurable through the difference in second virial coefficients of hydrogen and deuterium.
