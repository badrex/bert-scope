tldr: The authors studied the catalytic effects of fluoride solutions in various reactions, including the hydrolysis of diethyl acetal, the depolymerization of paraldehyde, the decomposition of nitramide, and more. They found that fluoride buffers and dilute hydrogen fluoride solutions showed general acid-base catalysis and specific catalysis by hydrogen ions in some reactions. The results provide insights into the structures and thermodynamic properties of the species involved in these reactions.
