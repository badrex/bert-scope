tldr: This article discusses the use of X-ray spectroscopy to study the interaction of lasers with plasmas, particularly in inertial confinement fusion. The authors demonstrate how X-ray spectroscopy can provide valuable information on the interaction and implosion dynamics of laser-imploded targets, such as the study of heat conductivity, mixing of target layers, and determination of temperature and density at the compressed target core.
