tldr: The authors describe the development and operation of a transient hot-wire apparatus for measuring gas-phase thermal conductivities. The method offers advantages over steady-state apparatuses by minimizing the effects of natural convection and not requiring physical dimensions in the zeroth-order calculation of thermal conductivity. Results are provided for helium and other gases, demonstrating a precision of 0.1% and an absolute accuracy of 0.5% for the described apparatus.
