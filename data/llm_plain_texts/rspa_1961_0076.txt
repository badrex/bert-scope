tldr: The authors studied the kinetics of reactions between active nitrogen and oxygen, as well as nitrogen and nitric oxide. They found that the rate of reaction (1) was first order in both nitrogen atom and oxygen molecule concentrations. The results showed that both reactions proceed through transition complexes with similar molecular constants and vibration frequencies to those of nitrogen dioxide. This research helps to understand the chemistry of the atmosphere and the behavior of reactive nitrogen species.
