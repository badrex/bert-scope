tldr: The authors investigated the kinetics of the base-catalyzed bromination of ethyl cyclopentanone 2-carboxylate in aqueous solution. They found that the reaction's rate is independent of bromine concentration and depends on the proton transfer rate to the catalyzing species. The study determined the catalytic constants of seven basic species and showed that the reaction's kinetics conform to the regularities previously observed in the ionization of related compounds.
