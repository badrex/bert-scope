tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the changes in electrical conductivity in plant roots under geotropic stimulation. They discovered that turning the root horizontal caused an immediate decrease in resistance, which was interpreted as an increase in permeability to ions. The authors developed a new apparatus to measure the resistance and tested it on the root-tip of Vicia Faba, providing insights into the mechanism of geotropic response in plants.
