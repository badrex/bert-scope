tldr: The authors investigated the spontaneous crystallization of monochloracetic acid and naphthalene mixtures, which form mixed crystals with a minimum or eutectic freezing point. They found that the mixtures containing excess naphthalene above the eutectic composition mainly formed crystals with the form and optical properties of pure naphthalene. The mixtures with excess monochloracetic acid also showed a definite supersolubility curve, but the authors discovered multiple freezing points for these mixtures, which may belong to different modifications of monochloracetic acid. This study provides insights into the spontaneous crystallization of different modifications of a substance dissolved in another substance that is not polymorphous.
