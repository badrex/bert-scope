tldr: The article is an obituary for Dr. John Horne, a distinguished Scottish geologist who made significant contributions to the understanding of tectonics, stratigraphy, and glacial problems. Horne, along with his life-long partner Benjamin Peach, conducted groundbreaking research in the North of Scotland, Shetland, Orkney, and Caithness, and played a crucial role in the mapping and understanding of the geology of these regions. His work, particularly in the North-West Highlands, helped to resolve a long-standing controversy and provided a clear understanding of the geological history and structure of the area.
