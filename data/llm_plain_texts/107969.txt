semantic_tags:
  - Celestial mechanics
  - Lunar theory
  - Astronomical calculations
  - Perturbation theory
  - Mathematical astronomy
tldr: The author presents further research in physical astronomy, focusing on lunar theory and secular inequalities. They discuss the integration of equations and the stability of the lunar orbit, as well as the development of expressions for the reciprocal of the radius vector. The author also compares their results with previous work by M. DAMOISEAU and LAPLACE.
