tldr: This study investigates the resonance of long-period waves near islands, focusing on Kelvin and shelf-type waves. The authors conducted model experiments in a rotating basin to verify the predicted resonant frequencies and assess the effects of wave amplitude and horizontal scale. The results confirm the resonance phenomenon for Kelvin-type waves and reveal discrepancies between the experiments and theoretical predictions for shelf-type waves.
