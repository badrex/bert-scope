tldr: The authors present observations from the Royal Society Joint Air-Sea Interaction Project (JASIN) that study the structure of the upper ocean and the wind-driven momentum budget. They discuss the density field, inertial oscillations, and tidal interactions, providing insights into the physical processes involved in air-sea interaction.
