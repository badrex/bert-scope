tldr: This article discusses the current status and future potential of all-optical switching and logic elements. It explores various types of bistable optical devices, their limitations, and the materials used. The author also describes two areas where all-optical signal-processing systems are likely to have a major impact: high-speed switching in optical communications systems and optical computing.
