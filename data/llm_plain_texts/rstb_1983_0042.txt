tldr: This article discusses the biological roles of protein phosphorylation and its connection to calcium binding. It explores how the phosphate group acts as a negative 'calcium' ion, binding covalently and needing catalyzed binding and removal. The article also suggests that the adjustment of helical segments of proteins may be a general transmission device, useful in gating calcium channels and controlling ATP-utilizing reactions and pumps.
