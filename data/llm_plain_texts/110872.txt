tldr: The author, C.F. Schoenbein, discovered a new oxidizing and bleaching principle produced by the slow combustion of ether in atmospheric air and rapid combustion of bodies in a jet of hydrogen gas. This principle can decompose various compounds, including indigo, iodide of potassium, and hydroiodic acid. It also transforms the colors of certain salts and converts sulphurous acid into sulphuric acid. Schoenbein concludes that this principle is produced in all cases of rapid combustion in atmospheric air, regardless of the substance being burnt.
