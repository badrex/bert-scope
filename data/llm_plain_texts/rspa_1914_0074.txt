tldr: The author examines the crystal structures and properties of various parasulphonic derivatives of chloro-, bromo-, iodo-, and cyanobenzene. They describe the methods used to prepare these compounds and provide detailed measurements and calculations of their crystal angles and forms. This research contrasts para-mono-derivatives of benzenesulphonic acid with di-derivatives studied by Colgate and Rod.
