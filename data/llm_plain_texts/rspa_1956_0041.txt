tldr: Researchers developed a method to determine the directions and frequencies of wave trains in the sea using a shipborne wave recorder and Doppler shifts. The study found that the mean frequency of waves varies sinusoidally with the ship's course, allowing for the identification of predominant wave directions. This method helps in understanding the growth and propagation of sea waves, especially in open ocean areas where the highest waves are generated.
