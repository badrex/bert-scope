tldr: The authors investigate the astonishing variation in chromosomal DNA among species of higher plants, focusing on the amplification of base sequences within chromosomes. They discuss the functional significance of repetitive DNA, which may comprise 70% or more of the total DNA, and its potential effects on cell size, cell division duration, and the evolution of species. The study also explores the consequences of DNA variation on plant breeding and the improvement of plant products.
