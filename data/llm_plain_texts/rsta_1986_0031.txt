tldr: This article discusses the potential for reactivation of extensional fault systems in the continental lithosphere. It examines the geometry of these fault systems and their mechanical considerations, focusing on their potential for reactivation and the styles of reactivation. The article also highlights the importance of fault orientation in the stress field and the role of fluids within fault zones in influencing their tendency to be reactivated.
