tldr: Frederick William Twort was a pioneering microbiologist who made significant contributions to the understanding of bacterial mutation, adaptation, and growth factors. His work on bacterial fermentation and the isolation of pure cultures of bacteria using selective inhibition laid the foundation for future research in bacterial nutrition and evolution. Twort's ideas on pathogenic organisms evolving from "wild" types and his demonstration of the importance of growth factors in bacterial growth were ahead of his time and only gained recognition later.
