tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the origin of fibrin ferment in blood plasma. They discovered that ferment appears in plasma in the absence of cellular elements, suggesting that it comes from some constituents of the plasma itself. The author also found that the presence of lecithin can speed up the coagulation process and the appearance of ferment.
