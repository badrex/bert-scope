tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine if the opsonic index is identical to the hemophagocytic index using melanin. They found that an immune serum can be deopsonized by melanin, suggesting that melanin can become opsonized. The opsonization and deopsonization processes are likely mechanical, as the finely divided melanin entangles or becomes invested with the finely particulate material of which the opsonin consists.
