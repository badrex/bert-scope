tldr: The author presents a mathematical theory for scalar and clinant radical loci in algebraic coordinate geometry. By using the concept of scalar and clinant roots, the author demonstrates how to represent algebraic formations geometrically and how to determine the coefficients for various equations. The theory can be applied to various algebraic equations and geometric shapes, such as triangles, polygons, and curves.
