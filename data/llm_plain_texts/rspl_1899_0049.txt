tldr: This study investigates the effects of thyroid feeding on monkeys, focusing on exophthalmos and other symptoms. The results show that large doses of thyroid preparations cause eye changes, hair loss, and paralysis in monkeys. The study suggests that thyroid extract may act similarly to the stimulation of the cervical sympathetic and that the increased secretion of the altered thyroid in Graves' disease may be partly responsible for exophthalmos in that condition.
