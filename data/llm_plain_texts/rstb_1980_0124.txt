tldr: The article discusses the development of the UK Spallation Neutron Source, a high-intensity pulsed neutron source that offers significant advantages over steady-state reactor sources. The source uses an 800 MeV proton synchrotron accelerator to produce fast neutrons, which are then slowed down in nearby hydrogenous moderators. The moderated neutrons are used in 18 neutron scattering instruments for various scientific applications, including the study of liquids, amorphous materials, and high-energy excitations in crystalline materials. The new source provides unrivaled potential for using epithermal neutrons, offering improved performance and reduced power consumption compared to traditional reactor sources.
