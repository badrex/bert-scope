tldr: The author investigates the oscillatory and rolling motion of a heterogeneous cylinder on a horizontal plane, determining the time occupied in its oscillation and rolling, and the pressure on the plane. The study has practical applications to the theory of pendulums and the stability of locomotive engines in rapid motion.
