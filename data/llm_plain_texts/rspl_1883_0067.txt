tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the magnetic susceptibility and maximum magnetization of various materials, such as iron and steel, using the direct magnetometric method. They found that the magnetization of these materials reaches a maximum limit, and discussed the advantages and disadvantages of their experimental methods.
