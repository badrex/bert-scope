tldr: The author investigates the mineral constituents of a dusty atmosphere using a quartz spectrograph and discovers that copper and calcium are prominent elements in the atmosphere. They find that the intensity of these elements' lines in the spectra increases with the amount of dust in the air, suggesting that these elements play a role in chemical reactions and isodynamic changes.
