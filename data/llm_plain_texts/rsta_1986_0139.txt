tldr: This article discusses the constraints that limits on microwave background anisotropy provide on theories of galaxy formation that incorporate non-baryonic dark matter. The authors focus on scale-invariant perturbations, which may be in either an adiabatic or an isocurvature mode. They find that adiabatic models with cold dark matter lead to excessive small-scale anisotropies unless galaxies are biased tracers of the mass. Isocurvature cold dark-matter models are incompatible with observations even if the amplitude of the galaxy correlation function is more than four times that of the mass distribution.
