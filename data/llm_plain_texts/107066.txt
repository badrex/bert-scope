tldr: The author, William Hyde Wollaston, conducted experiments to study the effect of temperature on the refraction of light over water. He discovered that the quantity of refraction could be significant when the land was close enough to influence the temperature of the air. This finding suggests that nautical observations may require correction for accurate navigation, as the horizon's apparent height can vary due to changes in temperature and atmospheric conditions.
