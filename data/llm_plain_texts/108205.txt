tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the role of nitrogen in plant growth and its sources. They discovered that plants absorb nitrogen from both the soil and the atmosphere, and the amount of nitrogen a plant takes in depends on various factors such as temperature, sunlight, and the type of plant. This research helps us understand the importance of nitrogen in plant growth and the role it plays in agriculture.
