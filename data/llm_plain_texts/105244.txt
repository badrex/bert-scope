tldr: The author conducted experiments to examine the properties of platina and its mixtures with gold. They found that platina can be mixed with gold in certain proportions without affecting its color or ductility. The author also discovered that these mixtures have different specific gravities and can be detected through various tests. This research aimed to prevent potential abuses of platina and gold mixtures and to help identify them when they occur.
