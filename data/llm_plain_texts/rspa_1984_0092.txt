tldr: The authors studied the vibrational population distribution of H2+ formed from various precursor molecules using translational spectroscopy. They observed differences in the collision-induced spectra, which reflect the initial vibrational distributions of H2+ in each precursor. The authors calculated the vibrational population distributions for each precursor and found small deviations from the distribution obtained when hydrogen gas was the precursor. This research provides insights into the formation and properties of molecular ions in different environments.
