tldr: The authors investigate the stress distribution around a circular hole in an elastic plate due to prescribed tractions in the plane of the plate acting on the boundary. They provide a mathematical solution for the stresses and discuss the effects of Poisson's ratio on the stress distribution, concluding that the effects are negligible in practical applications.
