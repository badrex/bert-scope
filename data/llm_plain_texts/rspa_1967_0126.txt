tldr: The authors explore the nonlinear interactions between planetary waves, which are essential for understanding atmospheric and oceanic motions. They study the conditions for resonant interactions between these waves and find that the energy transfer occurs in the neighborhoods of two critical latitude circles, symmetrically north and south of the equator. The analysis allows for a nonzero horizontal divergence of the motion and provides insights into the energy exchange between resonant wave triplets and continuous spectra.
