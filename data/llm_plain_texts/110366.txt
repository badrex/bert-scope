tldr: James Walker conducted experiments on the resistance of fluids to objects passing through them. He found that in light vessels, sharpness is more important in the bow than in the stern, while in vessels carrying heavy cargoes, the reverse is true. Walker also discussed the results of experiments in Scotland, where boats moving on canals experienced increased velocities without a proportional increase in resistance.
