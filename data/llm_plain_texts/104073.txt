tldr: The author presents a case study of a patient with asthma who coughed up a polypus resembling a branch of the pulmonary vein. The polypus was fibrous, hollow, and resembled the structure of vessels in the lungs. The author suggests that this phenomenon may explain a similar case described by Tulpius and provides insights into the nature of the polypus and its relation to the respiratory system.
