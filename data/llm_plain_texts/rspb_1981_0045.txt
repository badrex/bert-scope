tldr: The study examines the structure and development of the apical organ in trochophore larvae of Spirobranchus, Phyllodoce maculata, and Phyllodoce mucosa. The apical organ is a crucial sensory organ in marine larvae, and this research provides insights into its neural nature and relationship to the rest of the larval nervous system. The findings reveal a plexus-like structure that plays a significant role in the development and functioning of the larval nervous system, including the establishment of the path for the cerebral commissure.
