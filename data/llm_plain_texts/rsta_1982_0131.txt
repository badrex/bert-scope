tldr: The article discusses the techniques of Doppler-free spectroscopy based on the creation and detection of Hertzian coherence in atomic and molecular systems. It explores the use of broadband optical excitation, pulsed tunable dye lasers, and time-resolved observations to study the interference phenomenon known as quantum beats and determine LandÃ© factors, fine, and hyperfine splittings of excited levels. The review also covers recent advancements in probe-beam monitoring and pulse trains from mode-locked dye lasers.
