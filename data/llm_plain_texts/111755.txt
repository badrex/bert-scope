tldr: The author examines the structure of microscopic test-objects, such as the scales of Podura plumbea and the valves of Pleurosigma, to understand their action on transmitted light. They discuss the importance of defining power and separating power in object-glass design and how the structure of these test-objects can help determine the quality of an object-glass. The author also explains the appearance of bright and dark points in the center of the markings of these objects, which can be attributed to the accumulation and refraction of light by the object's structure.
