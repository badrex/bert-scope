tldr: This article provides corrections for two papers published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. The first paper discusses the flux integral for axisymmetric perturbations of static space-times, and the second paper focuses on calculating diffracted intensities from crystals containing planar faults. The corrections address various typographical and mathematical errors found in the original papers.
