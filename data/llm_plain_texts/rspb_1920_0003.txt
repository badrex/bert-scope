tldr: The authors conducted experiments on pigeons to study the relationship between beriberi, a nutritional disease, and the adrenal glands. They found that in both dry and wet beriberi cases, there was a significant enlargement of the adrenal glands and an increase in adrenalin content. This suggests that a deficiency in essential nutrients may lead to an overproduction of adrenalin, which could be a factor in the development of oedema in general.
