tldr: This article investigates the behavior of the crystalline structure of brass under slow and rapid cyclic stresses. The authors discovered that the structure's response depends on the speed of stress application. Slow cycles cause different structural changes than rapid cycles, which can suppress the main structural modifications associated with the transition through a yield point. This suppression provides useful information on the response of the internal crystalline structure of the metal to an externally applied stress.
