tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the effects of anaesthetics on amoeboid movement. They found that cyanides, sulphides, and pyrophosphates affect amoeboid movement similarly to oxygen deficiency. Cyanides cause a progressive fall in velocity, ultimately ending in complete inhibition. The author also discovered that the effects of cyanides are reversible and do not cause cytolysis, unlike in freshwater Amoeba proteus.
