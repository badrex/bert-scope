tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the splitting strength and surface energy of mica. They found that the splitting strength is a constant for mica, and that the surface energy is independent of the shape of the mica sheets chosen. Mica placed in optical contact is totally restored, and the strength of mica in a high vacuum is more than in air and is also a fairly well-defined constant. The authors also observed electrical phenomena and luminescence when splitting mica in different environments.
