tldr: The study examines the transformation of muscle tissue into bioluminescent tissue in the fish Benthalbella infans. The luminescent tissue is derived from skeletal muscle, and the process involves the presence of granules, remnants of myofibrils, and lysosomes. The findings provide insights into the development and functioning of the fish's bioluminescent organs, known as photophores.
