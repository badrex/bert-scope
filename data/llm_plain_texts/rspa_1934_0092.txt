tldr: The authors conducted experiments to analyze the fine structure of alpha-particle groups from thorium C and measured the energy difference between the two main groups using electrostatic acceleration. Their results provided accurate information about the energy levels of the thorium C nucleus and were in excellent agreement with other independent measurements. This research contributed to the understanding of nuclear physics and the study of radioactive materials.
