tldr: In 1749, a massive inundation occurred in the Valley of St. John near Keswick in Cumberland. The event was marked by a sudden, violent thunderstorm and the rapid flow of water down the valley. The author, John Lock, describes the damage caused by the flood, including the destruction of a mill and a kiln, and the displacement of large rocks and debris. The flood's impact on the environment and the possible causes of the event are also discussed.
