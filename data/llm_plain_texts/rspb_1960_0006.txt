tldr: The author examines the absorption of glucose by the green alga Scenedesmus quadricauda and finds that the rate of glucose uptake increases with the age of the culture. The study also shows that glucose absorption does not occur through the entire plasma membrane but only at specific absorption centers. This research suggests that there is a differential absorption of hexoses by Scenedesmus quadricauda, and glucose absorption is not limited by thermal diffusion.
