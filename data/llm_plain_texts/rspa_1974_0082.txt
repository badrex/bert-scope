tldr: The authors propose a new method to calculate the lattice vibrational component of specific heat in spinel ferrites using infrared frequencies. They apply this method to cobalt and nickel ferrites and find good agreement with the spin-wave theory of dispersion. This new approach allows for a better understanding of the spin-wave contribution to the specific heat in spinel ferrites.
