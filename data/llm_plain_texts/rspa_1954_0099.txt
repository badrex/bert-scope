tldr: This study investigates the equilibrium distribution of sulfur between simple silicate melts and gas phases, with a focus on the displacement of oxygen atoms by sulfur atoms in silicates. The research is of interest to chemists, metallurgists, and geologists, as it provides insight into the nature of inorganic melts and their thermodynamic properties. The findings have implications for desulfurization processes and other slag reactions involving sulfides.
