tldr: The authors investigate the stability of a flow of an electrically conducting fluid between parallel planes under a transverse magnetic field. They find that the critical Reynolds number increases with the magnetic field, indicating a stabilizing influence on the flow. The study focuses on the effect of the magnetic field on the velocity distribution and the resulting stability of the motion.
