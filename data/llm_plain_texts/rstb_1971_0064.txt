tldr: This article reviews the development of studies on axoplasmic transport in non-adrenergic and adrenergic neurons. It discusses results from various methods, such as histochemical, biochemical, electronmicroscopical, autoradiographical, and radiological studies. Two main types of axoplasmic transport are identified: slow axonal flow and fast transport. The influence of nerve activity and drugs on axoplasmic transport is also discussed, along with possible mechanisms for axonal transport in neurons.
