tldr: The authors developed a new method to detect electrical oscillations by observing the change in hysteresis in magnetic materials. They found that the presence of oscillations increased hysteresis, which allowed them to create a more sensitive detector for wireless telegraphy. This method provided a better understanding of the physical properties of magnetic materials and their response to oscillating electric fields.
