tldr: The authors propose a hypothesis that the creation of matter in relativistic cosmology is accompanied by the creation of gravitinos, entities of zero rest-mass and negative energy. They develop a more specific description of continual creation and work out the energy-momentum tensor using Synge's method. The authors argue that the annihilation of matter by gravitinos is relatively unlikely to occur in an expanding universe and discuss the implications for homogeneous isotropic cosmological models.
