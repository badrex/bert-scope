tldr: This study investigates the impact of yarn non-uniformity, specifically slubs, on the stability of the ring-spinning balloon. The authors develop a two-variable perturbation expansion procedure to analyze the effect of slubs on the yarn's mass linear density and demonstrate that even small slubs can significantly affect the balloon's stability. The results provide a method to quantify these effects in ring spinning processes.
