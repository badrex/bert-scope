tldr: The authors present the photoelectron spectra of isocyanic acid, isothiocyanic acid, and hydrazoic acid, and analyze the molecular orbitals from which electrons are ejected. They compare the spectra with those of carbon dioxide, carbon oxysulphide, and nitrous oxide, and discuss the relation between the photoelectron spectra and bond angles in the neutral molecules. The study provides insights into the electronic structures and bonding powers of these molecules.
