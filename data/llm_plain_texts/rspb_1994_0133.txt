tldr: Researchers used microsatellites to identify the patrilines and genetic relatedness in honeybee colonies. They found that the genetic structure of a colony remains largely unchanged over time as long as the same queen leads the colony. This study provides a precise assessment of honeybee colony genetics and helps understand the social biology of honeybees.
