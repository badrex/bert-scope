tldr: A violent rainstorm hit Yorkshire, causing significant damage to houses, mills, bridges, and other structures. The torrential rain led to the drowning of fifteen people and caused widespread destruction, including tearing up the dead from their graves and sweeping away all the corn land. Some individuals managed to save themselves by climbing onto their house roofs until the floods subsided.
