tldr: The author examines the development of the skull in the Edentata, a group of mammals, by studying their embryos and comparing their chondrocranium and investing bones. They highlight the unique features of the mammalian skull, such as the rupture of the side walls due to the pressure of the large lateral masses of the cerebrum and the development of the nasal organs, which set them apart from other animals like Sauropsida, Crocodiles, and Birds.
