tldr: This article discusses the origin and characteristics of large intensity-dependent changes in the refractive index of the semiconductor cadmium mercury telluride (CdHgTe). The authors report nonlinear Fabry-Perot response under different experimental conditions and observe optical switching and bistability in the transmission of a room-temperature etalon. They compare these results with the reported work on InSb and explain the underlying mechanisms of optical nonlinearities in CdHgTe.
