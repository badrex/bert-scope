tldr: The author presents a statistical theory to explain Macleod's equation for surface tension and the parachor, a measure of molecular volume at equal surface tensions. The theory is based on the free energy of the system and the excess configurational energy of the interface. The author derives the relationship between surface tension and the parachor, providing insights into the behavior of liquids and their surface tensions.
