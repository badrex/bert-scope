tldr: This article investigates the temperature dependence of shear constants in metals and alloys at low temperatures. The authors find that the change in electronic distribution with temperature can affect the shear constants, leading to an additional term in the specific heat. This effect is particularly significant in metals where the Fermi surface lies close to the Brillouin-zone boundaries.
