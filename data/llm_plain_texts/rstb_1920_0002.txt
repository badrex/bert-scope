tldr: The author studies the morphology, biology, and relationships of Archotermopsis wrou, Desn., a primitive termite species. They also investigate the presence of intestinal protozoa and their significance in the termite's biology. The author discusses the termite's polymorphism, suggesting a hypothesis based on Mendelian inheritance to explain the phenomenon. The study contributes to understanding the complex biology and taxonomy of termites and their symbiotic relationships with protozoa.
