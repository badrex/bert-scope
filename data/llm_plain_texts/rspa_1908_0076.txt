tldr: The authors developed a new sounding machine that can be used on lakes and rivers without a boat, making it easier to obtain accurate bathymetrical charts. The machine consists of two posts connected by a line, with the observer and assistant working together to move the float across the lake and record depth and distance. This innovative device allows for more efficient and accessible exploration of water bodies.
