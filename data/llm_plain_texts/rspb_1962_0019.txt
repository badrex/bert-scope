tldr: This study examines the morphological changes and population fluctuations of oogonia and oocytes in the ovaries of foetal and neonatal rats. The research provides a detailed quantitative analysis of germ cell populations at different developmental stages, correlating these findings with previous radio-sensitivity studies. The results reveal two periods of high radio-sensitivity in the germ cells, with the first period associated with a high incidence of oogonial divisions and the second period linked to the end of prophase and the onset of the dictyate or resting phase.
