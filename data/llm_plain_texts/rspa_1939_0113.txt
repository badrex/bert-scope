tldr: The author investigates the photosynthesis of carbohydrates from hydrated carbon dioxide using thorium oxide-promoted nickel carbonate. They find that the presence of thorium oxide in a specific molecular ratio with nickel oxide can render nickel carbonate photosynthetically active. The author also develops a method to coat kieselguhr with the active material, which can be used for further research in photosynthesis.
