tldr: This article discusses the formation and evolution of Mediterranean back-arc basins, which developed within the Alpine-Mediterranean orogenic belt during and after the Tertiary continental collisions. The four main back-arc basins considered are the Pannonian, Aegean, Alboran, and Tyrrhenian basins. The article examines the general features of these basins and the geodynamic models that explain their formation, focusing on the role of gravity in initiating and maintaining back-arc extension and the isostatic response to structural changes of the lithosphere.
