tldr: The authors studied the effect of cross-linking on the elastic modulus of Polythene by exposing it to radiation. They found that cross-linking increases Young's modulus, while the loss of crystallinity decreases it. The results showed that at a certain radiation dose, the cross-linked Polythene has the same modulus as the unirradiated material. The authors also compared their findings with the theory of rubber-like elasticity, which relates Young's modulus to temperature and molecular weight between cross-links.
