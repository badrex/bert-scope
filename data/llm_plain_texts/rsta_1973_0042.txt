tldr: This article discusses the challenges and limitations in measuring and interpreting changes of strain in the Earth, specifically earth tides, and their significance in geophysics. The authors examine observational anomalies, assess the reliability of instruments, and explore the coherency of measurements. They emphasize the importance of further experimental investigations and theoretical models to improve understanding of the Earth's crust and mantle.
