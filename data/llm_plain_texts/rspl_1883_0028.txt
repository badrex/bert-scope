tldr: The authors, Hartley, Adeney, and Stokes, describe a method of measuring the wave-lengths of rays of high refrangibility in the spectra of elementary substances using a small Rutherfurd speculum. They accurately measured the lines in the spectra and calculated the wave-lengths, comparing them with previous measurements. The study includes 2307 lines from various elements, and a series of photographs is presented with the paper to illustrate the findings.
