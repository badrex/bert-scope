revised_title: 'Steady Fall of Spherical Particles Through Fluid Medium: A Revised Analysis'
semantic_tags:
  - Fluid dynamics
  - Particle motion
  - Stokes' Law
  - Gas dynamics
  - Molecular collisions
tldr: The authors analyze the velocity of spherical particles falling through a fluid medium and provide a revised formula for calculating the force required to maintain the particles' motion. They consider the effects of particle size, molecular collisions, and the interactions between particles, leading to a better understanding of the behavior of particles in a fluid.
