tldr: The article investigates the gating properties of connexin32 cell-cell channels and their mutants expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The researchers found that oocytes expressing a mutant lacking 58 carboxyl terminal amino acids exhibited junctional conductances similar to those expressing wild-type connexin32. The gating properties of the channels formed by this mutant were indistinguishable from those of wild-type connexin32 channels, including a novel pH-dependent voltage gate. This research helps to understand the role of carboxyl terminal domains in the regulation of connexin channels.
