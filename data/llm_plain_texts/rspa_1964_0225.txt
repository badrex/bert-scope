revised_title: The C-Field as a Direct Particle Field: A New Approach to Gravitational Theory

tldr: The authors propose a new approach to gravitational theory by introducing the C-field, a scalar field generated by discrete particles. They derive the source equation for the C-field in terms of particle world-lines and discuss its implications for the equations of motion and the avoidance of singularities in the theory of relativity.
