tldr: The authors conducted an experiment to investigate the forces acting on a charged condenser moving through space. They found no evidence of any interaction between the ether and matter, and concluded that the electrostatic energy of a charged condenser does not diminish when moving at right angles to its electrostatic lines of force.
