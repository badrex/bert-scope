tldr: In 1730, Mr. Richard Lewis observed an Aurora Borealis in Maryland. The phenomenon appeared fainter than those seen in England. It had a reddish color and sent out whitish streams from its north part. Dr. Samuel Chew also reported observing spots on the sun, which could be related to the aurora.
