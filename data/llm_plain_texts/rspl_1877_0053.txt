tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the natural amount of sugar in the blood of different animals and the effect of anaesthetics on blood sugar levels. They found that the amount of sugar in the blood of sheep, bullocks, and dogs is around half per 1000, and that anaesthetics can cause a preternatural amount of sugar in the blood. The author also discovered that the comparative state of arterial and venous blood is of deep physiological importance.
