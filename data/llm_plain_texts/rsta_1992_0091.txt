tldr: This article discusses the phenomenon of pulsar scintillation, which occurs when pulsar radiation passes through the inhomogeneous interstellar medium. Observations of scintillation provide valuable information on the structure and properties of the interstellar gas and can be used to study pulsar speeds, ages, and physical sizes of emission regions. The rich variety of scintillation phenomena displayed by pulsars has become a fruitful source of new information on both their physical properties and the irregular structure of the interstellar gas.
