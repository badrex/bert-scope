tldr: The authors conducted a series of experiments to study the influence of coal-dust in colliery explosions. They found that the presence of coal-dust significantly increases the distance the flame can travel in an explosion, making coal mines more dangerous. The authors also discovered that dry weather and proper sealing of the experimental apparatus are crucial for accurate results.
