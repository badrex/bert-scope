tldr: The study investigates the spatial dynamics and integration of modules within genets in two grassland perennials, Beilis perennis and Prunella vulgaris, with contrasting growth forms. The experiments reveal that the phalanx species (Beilis) responds with increased module aggregation in the presence of Lolium, while the guerrilla species (Prunella) shows decreased module aggregation. The findings highlight the ecological implications of different growth forms in clonal plants and their response to environmental heterogeneity.
