tldr: This article discusses the tectonic fabric of the Atlantic and Indian oceans and the evidence supporting continental drift. The authors analyze the ocean floor's topography, including aseismic ridges, fracture zones, and the Mid-Oceanic Ridge, and propose that the scattered linear micro-continents in the Indian Ocean are fragments of former continents. They also explore the challenges in explaining the complex tectonic patterns in terms of simple convection currents.
