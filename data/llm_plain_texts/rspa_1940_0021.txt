tldr: The authors analyzed 19 months of continuous observations of the maximum ionization densities in the F2 region of the ionosphere and found a correlation between ionization density and meteorological conditions. They discovered that the F2 ionization density tends to be lower on days when a main frontal zone passes through New South Wales, suggesting that a significant part of the day-to-day fluctuation of F2 ionization density is associated with meteorological changes at the ground.
