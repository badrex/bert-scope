tldr: The authors investigate the thermal conductivity of dielectric solids at low temperatures using a theoretical approach. They develop a general formula for thermal conductivity and apply it to quartz glass and crystals. The study compares theoretical predictions with experimental data for alkalihalides and quartz, providing insights into the effects of defects in neutron-irradiated quartz.
