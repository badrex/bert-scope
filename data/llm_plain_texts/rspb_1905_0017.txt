tldr: The author, George Murray, describes a new species of Rhabdosphere, a tiny marine organism, which he names Rhabdosphcera Blackmaniana. This new species has sharp spinous processes, making it different from the two previously known species. The discovery of this new species challenges previous ideas about the classification of Rhabdospheres and may have implications for understanding deep-sea deposits and oceanography.
