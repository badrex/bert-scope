tldr: The authors investigate the uniqueness and stability of the conduction-diffusion solution to the Boussinesq equations when going backward in time. They show that if the solution satisfies certain weak a priori bounds, the conduction-diffusion solution to the final value problem for the Boussinesq equations is stable on compact subintervals of a finite time interval. Uniqueness of the solution to the final value problem is also established.
