tldr: This study examines interglacial deposits at Tattershall Thorpe in Lincolnshire, focusing on the fossils, pollen, plant macrofossils, and mollusks found within the deposits. The findings indicate that the interglacial sediments were deposited during the Ipswichian Interglacial, providing evidence of a warm climate with mild winter temperatures and slightly warmer summer temperatures than today. The research also suggests that the deposits were formed in a slow-flowing, well-vegetated stream and that the area experienced mildly brackish conditions during deposition.
