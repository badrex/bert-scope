revised_title: The Structure of Benzene: A Modern Theoretical Approach
semantic_tags:
  - Benzene structure
  - Quantum theory
  - Valency theory
  - Resonance
  - Aromatic compounds
tldr: The author presents a modern theoretical approach to understanding the structure of benzene using the quantum theory and the concept of resonance. They explain how benzene's stability arises from the resonance between different possible electron distributions, which leads to the formation of a bond and the unique properties of aromatic compounds.
