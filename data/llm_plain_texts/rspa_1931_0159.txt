tldr: The authors conducted an experiment to analyze the arc spectrum of iodine using a high-frequency discharge in a quartz capillary. They found that the strong arc lines were between X 4700 and the infra-red limit of the sensitized photographic plate. The study also investigated the behavior of doublets and groups of lines in the red and far-red region, which were suggested to belong to the arc spectrum. The authors provided a theoretical term scheme for iodine, which showed that terms based on 3P of the ion were expected to be more prominent than those based on XD and XS.
