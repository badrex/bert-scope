tldr: This article discusses the experiments conducted on gold-tin alloys to study their crystallization and crystal analysis. The authors found that well-defined crystals are common to all gold-tin alloys containing from 43% to 27.4% gold. They also discovered that crystals and mother-liquor are never of the same composition. These findings are consistent with previous research on tin and antimony alloys.
