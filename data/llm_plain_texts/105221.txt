tldr: The authors propose a periodic review of the variation of the magnetic needle to improve navigation and trade. They request the Royal Society's contribution by collecting observations from its members and their foreign correspondents. The authors explain the benefits of their proposed system, including determining longitude and latitude, and confirm the usefulness of the system through examples. They also encourage the use of this system on land for further advantages.
