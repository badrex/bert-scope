tldr: The author, Everard Home, discovered a small lobe in the human prostate gland that had not been previously observed by anatomists. This lobe, which resembles Cowper's gland, is connected to the vasa deferentia and can cause swelling and enlargement, leading to difficulties in passing urine. The discovery of this lobe helps explain the nature of certain diseases and their effects on the urinary system.
