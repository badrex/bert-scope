tldr: This article discusses the unique ossification process of the terminal phalanges of digits, which begins at the tip and not in the center. It also mentions a recent memoir by M. Renault on the relationship between Lepidodendra and Sigillaria, and the aluminium-iodine reaction for investigating organic compounds containing oxygen.
