tldr: The authors conducted experiments on 20 transition elements to measure their electrical and thermal resistivity at low temperatures. They deduced the ideal resistivities due to electron scattering by thermal vibrations and compared them with the predictions of the standard theory. The results showed that the electrical and thermal resistivity of these elements varied differently at low temperatures, with some elements showing anomalies in their behavior. This study provided insights into the conduction properties of transition elements and helped understand their resistivity in various temperature ranges.
