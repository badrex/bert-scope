tldr: This study examines the ultrastructural changes that occur when T cells, specifically immune to antigens, interact with target cells. The research focuses on the morphological features of T cell interaction and the mechanisms of cell death. The findings reveal that T cells form two types of contact with target cells and that the process of cell death involves surface blebs, misshaping of the cell outline, vacuolation, and loss of cytoplasmic organelles. The study also discusses the possibility that T cell projections may be an early event in the lytic mechanism leading to cell death.
