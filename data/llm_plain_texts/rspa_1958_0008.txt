tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the magnetic susceptibility of oxygen in a clathrate compound and found that the molecule's behavior is influenced by the crystalline field surrounding it. They developed a new theory that considers the oxygen molecule as partially bound, which explains the discrepancies in previous measurements and provides a better understanding of the magnetic properties of the compound.
