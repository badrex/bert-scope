tldr: The author, Sir J.J. Thomson, explains his method for analyzing and sorting particles in positive rays using electric and magnetic fields. By measuring the deflections of these rays, he determines their charges, masses, and velocities. This method allows for the identification and study of various types of particles, including those with a single charge and those with more than one charge. The author also discusses the apparatus and techniques used in his experiments.
