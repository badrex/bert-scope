tldr: The author discusses the solutions of non-gauge invariant equations representing systems of particles, neutral and charged. These systems are independent and involve only one component of the four-potential. The charged system has an ellipsoidal surface dividing space into a linear and a localized nonlinear region. The neutral doublets in the ground state need explanation in relation to the accepted vector character of the tt mesons and the charge independence of nuclear forces.
