tldr: The author investigates the active modification of nitrogen and its effects on discharge potential. They find that the yield of active nitrogen is greatest near the cathode and decreases in the negative glow and Faraday dark space before increasing again in the positive column. The author also discovers that the intensity of the glow is higher in narrower discharge tubes, and the potential gradients are similar in both wide and narrow tubes. The presence of a foreign gas, such as oxygen, significantly affects the afterglow and discharge potential.
