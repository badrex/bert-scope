tldr: This study investigates the temperature of humans in the tropics, focusing on the effects of exercise, health, and environmental factors. The author found that exertion, whether physical or mental, affects body temperature, and that gentle exercise has a depressing influence. They also discovered that a healthy state quickly restores temperature after exercise, while sea sickness and severe illness raise body temperature. The author believes these findings can be applied to health and disease, emphasizing the importance of temperature variation for human well-being.
