tldr: The study investigates the relationship between song repertoire size and the volume of brain nuclei related to song in oscine birds. It finds a significant correlation between the relative volume of the high vocal centre (HVC) and the number of song types typically found in the repertoire. This research provides evidence for the repeated independent evolution of an association between the complexity of learned song and the relative volume of one of the song control nuclei involved in song learning.
