tldr: This study investigates the heat flow and conductivity of various rocks in South Africa, including dolomite, quartzite, lava, and granite. The authors measured the conductivities using the divided bar method and found that the increase of temperature with depth in the Witwatersrand is exceptionally slow. The results provide insights into the geothermal energy potential and geological conditions of the region.
