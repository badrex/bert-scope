tldr: This article extends the ideas of Donev and Tashkova to a relativistic nonlinearization of the classical Maxwell theory in continuous media. The authors describe the field using a 2-form on Minkowski space with values in a two-dimensional vector space. They introduce new equations based on energy-momentum exchange and find a large set of non-Maxwellian solutions, including (31)-soliton-like solutions.
