tldr: The authors use a simple lattice model to study the relationship between genotype and phenotype in protein folding. They find that neutral mutations play a crucial role in the evolution of protein folding, allowing for the formation of large evolutionary networks and enabling the traversal of these networks. The study highlights the importance of neutral mutations in the evolution of proteins and suggests that they may be essential for understanding the complexity of biological systems.
