tldr: 'The authors investigated the nature of the chemotactic substance produced by eggs of Fucus serratus and F. vesiculosus, which attracts sperm cells during fertilization. They found that the substance can be simulated by simple organic compounds and that its production is maintained for at least 3-4 days under certain conditions. The study provides insights into the fertilization process in Fucaceae.'
