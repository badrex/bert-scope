tldr: The author observed a unique reflex in monkeys, called cataleptoid reflexes, which involve prolonged and deliberate movements of the limbs. These reflexes provide insight into the scope of reflex inhibition and coordination, and the author also discovered that the animal's respiration remains unaffected during these reflexes. The term "cataleptoid" is used because these reflexes share some similarities with hypnotic catalepsy.
