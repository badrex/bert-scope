tldr: 'William Herschel conducted experiments on solar and terrestrial rays to understand the relationship between light and heat. He discovered that heat can be produced by different types of rays, including invisible solar rays and terrestrial heat from enclosed fires. Through experiments on reflection and refraction, Herschel confirmed that these heat-producing rays are subject to the same laws as light rays, supporting the idea that heat and light are related phenomena.'
