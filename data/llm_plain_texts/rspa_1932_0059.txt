tldr: The authors used an ultramicroscope to study turbulent flow in pipes. They observed the movement of particles in the fluid and found that near the center of the pipe, the ratios of velocity disturbances were approximately equal. As the wall was approached, the ratio of the velocity disturbance normal to the wall decreased, while the other two ratios increased. This research provided insights into the distribution of turbulence across a pipe and its relationship with the pipe wall.
