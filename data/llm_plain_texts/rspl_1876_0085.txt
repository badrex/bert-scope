tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study Crookes's force, a reaction between blackened disks and the walls of an exhausted chamber when a temperature difference exists. They found that the force can be explained by the known dynamical properties of the trace of gas present. The authors also investigated the influence of variations in gas tension and distance between reacting surfaces, and discovered that the force increases as the tension decreases. Their findings can help explain the behavior of radiometers with crumpled or inclined vanes.
