tldr: This lecture discusses the best materials and forms for compass needles, focusing on sheer steel and the pierced rhombus shape. It also presents a method for magnetizing needles using bar magnets and explores the relationship between needle length, directive force, and surface area. The author also investigates the deviation of compass needles due to soft iron attraction.
