tldr: The authors studied the polarization of light by crystals of iodine and discovered that the reflected light from the surface of iodine films is polarized. They also found that the transmitted light through thin iodine films is polarized, with the plane of polarization being perpendicular to the plane of the light that is polarized by reflection from the same portion of the film. The authors observed two forms of iodine, depending on the arrangement of the crystals, and discussed the differences in their optical properties.
