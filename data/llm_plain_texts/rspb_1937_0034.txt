tldr: The author investigates how the oestrous cycle in animals changes when they are transferred across the equator, and examines the factors that control sexual periodicity. The study shows that animals can adapt to new seasonal conditions, and that the nervous system plays an important role in regulating the oestrous cycle. The incidence of daylight is also found to be an important factor in controlling the cycle.
