tldr: The author conducted experiments on the chemical composition of the humours of the eye, specifically the aqueous, vitreous, and crystalline humour. They found that these humours are composed of water, albumen, gelatine, and a muriate, with the basis of the aqueous humour being soda. The author also observed differences in specific gravity and chemical composition between the humours of different animals, suggesting a possible relationship with eye size and vision.
