tldr: Researchers studied the motion of the frog's eardrum in response to sound using laser speckle vibrometry. They discovered that the middle ear cavity, composed of the Eustachian tubes and mouth cavity, acts as a Helmholtz resonator. The vibration of one eardrum causes a concomitant motion of the other, which is essential for directional hearing in frogs.
