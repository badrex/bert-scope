tldr: This article investigates the mechanism of the homogeneous combination of hydrogen and oxygen, focusing on non-stationary reaction chains. The authors discovered that at low pressures, the ignition of hydrogen and oxygen depends on the establishment of non-stationary reaction chains. They also found that the critical pressure for ignition is influenced by temperature, concentration, and the presence of foreign gases like argon.
