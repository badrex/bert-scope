tldr: 'The authors studied the structure and properties of hydroxy-stearic acid and its lactone in surface films. They found that the lactone is more compressible than the cyclohexanol film and that the hydroxyl group tends to approach the carboxyl group, possibly aided by the attraction of water molecules. The films on alkaline solutions are gaseous due to ionization of the end group decreasing lateral adhesion between molecules. The lactone is hydrolyzed to the acid when films are on alkaline solutions, causing an increase in area.'
