tldr: The International Programme of Ocean Drilling (IPOD) aims to study the evolution of passive continental margins by drilling and analyzing samples from these areas. This program helps to understand the tectonic development of margins, subsidence history, and the nature of the transition and modification of the crust at the margin. The knowledge gained from this research can provide insights into the Earth's history and the development of life on our planet, as well as the economic resource potential of continental margins.
