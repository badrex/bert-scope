tldr: The photochemical oxidation of gaseous methyl iodide was investigated, focusing on the elementary reactions and kinetics involved. The study found that oxygen molecules compete with iodine molecules and atoms for reaction with methyl radicals. The results indicate that the main reaction of methyl radicals with oxygen is a third-order one, forming methylperoxy radicals. The quantum yields of decomposition products, mainly methane, ethane, diiodoethane, and iodine, are quite small. The reaction is accelerated by the presence of silver, oxygen, and nitric oxide, which react with atomic or molecular iodine and methyl radicals.
