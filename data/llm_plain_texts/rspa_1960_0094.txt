tldr: This article presents a calorimetric study of the adsorption of oxygen on evaporated metal films. The authors used a Beeck-type calorimeter to measure the integral heat of adsorption for various metals, including titanium, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, niobium, molybdenum, rhodium, palladium, tantalum, tungsten, platinum, and aluminum. They also investigated the calorimetric behavior and surface areas of the films using krypton isotherms. The results show that the heat of adsorption can be related to the oxygen-metal ratios and the heats of formation of certain oxides, and that true chemisorption may occur in some cases.
