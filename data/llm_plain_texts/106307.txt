tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the role of acids in mineralization of substances, specifically focusing on the acids of sea salt and vitriol. They discovered that the acids contribute differently to the mineralization process and found a method to accurately ascertain the quantity of neutral salt in alkali. The experiments involved various minerals, including silver, lead, and mercury, and provided insights into the composition and properties of horn silver.
