tldr: This article presents a mathematical theory of evolution based on the conclusions of Dr. J.C. Willis. It explores the relationship between age, area, and species, and how these factors influence the distribution and extinction of species. The author suggests that species occupying larger areas are generally older and that larger genera have more species. The theory also introduces the concept of "specific mutation" and "generic mutation," which explains how new species and genera arise through mutations rather than gradual evolution.
