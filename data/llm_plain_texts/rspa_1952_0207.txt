tldr: This article discusses the limiting polarization of radio waves reflected from the ionosphere, focusing on the case of vertical incidence. The authors develop a method for calculating the limiting polarization using Forsterling's coupled wave equations, which apply only to vertical incidence. They find that at high frequencies, the limiting polarization is determined by the earth's magnetic field in the ionosphere.
