tldr: The author explores space-time reflexions, isobaric spin, and the mass ratio of bosons in particle physics. They propose a specific form for the mass operator that fulfills all requirements in the simplest way possible, leading to a mass ratio of 2, which deviates only slightly from that of K- and π-mesons. This necessary consequence reveals that the heavier particle has four components with charge and isobaric spin as found for π-mesons, while the lighter one has only three components with isobaric spin and charge assignments known to hold for π-mesons.
