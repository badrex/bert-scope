revised_title: 'Duality and Approximations in Meshes and Legendre Transforms'

tldr: The authors explore the relationship between mesh duality and Legendre duality, demonstrating how a general pair of meshes can be considered as a projection of piecewise linear functions that are dual to each other. They also discuss applications, including the Delaunay mesh and Voronoi tessellation, and provide examples from meteorology.
