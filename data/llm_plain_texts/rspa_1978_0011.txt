tldr: The authors used the prolongation method to construct a Lie algebra for a higher order Korteweg-de Vries equation. They found two values for which the equation has soliton solutions and discussed the connection forms and commutation relations in the Lie algebra. The study also introduced an eigenvalue problem for the equation, which can be transformed into the Lax formulation.
