tldr: The authors studied the life-history, cytology, and method of infection of Plasmodiophora brassicæ, the fungus responsible for finger-and-toe disease in cabbages and other crucifers. They discovered a conjugation process and provided a detailed account of the organism's life cycle, infection stages, and the effect of the fungus on its host plant.
