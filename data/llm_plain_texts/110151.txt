tldr: The author, Thomas Bell, examines the submaxillary odoriferous gland in crocodiles and alligators, a gland that secretes a musky substance. He describes its structure, which is unique among animal glands, and its probable function: attracting fish for predation. The gland's secretion is more abundant and potent during warmer weather when the animal feeds more frequently.
