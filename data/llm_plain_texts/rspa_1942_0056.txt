tldr: This study investigates the effect of temperature on boundary lubrication between mild steel surfaces using various chemical compounds as lubricants. The experiments reveal that a transition from smooth sliding to irregular stick and slip motion occurs at a temperature specific to the lubricant. The results suggest that lubrication is affected by a unimolecular film adsorbed on each surface, and the properties of surface films on metals can be studied through frictional behavior.
