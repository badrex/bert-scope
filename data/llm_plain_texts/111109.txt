tldr: 'The author, William Beneke, discusses the importance of phosphate of lime in the formation of cells in humans, animals, and plants. He explains that a deficiency of phosphate of lime can lead to disease and that administering it internally can help alleviate or cure these conditions. Beneke also explores the relationship between oxalic acid, phosphate elimination, and the presence of disease, as well as the factors that contribute to the production of oxalic acid.'
