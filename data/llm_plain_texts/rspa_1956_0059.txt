tldr: 'The authors present a general formula for the probability of genetical recombination, focusing on intercept length distributions and map distance. They discuss the consequences of different intercept length distributions and compare interference levels, concluding that the theory of interference based on the ix* distribution aligns better with observed natural phenomena.'
