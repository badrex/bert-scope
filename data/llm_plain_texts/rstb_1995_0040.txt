tldr: 'The article discusses the process of mapping protein folding pathways by determining the structures of transition states and intermediates. The authors use a combination of protein engineering and nuclear magnetic resonance methods to analyze the folding pathways of barnase and chymotrypsin inhibitor 2. They find that barnase folds according to a framework model, while chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 folds without a kinetically significant intermediate. The protein engineering method is also used to study the effects of molecular chaperones on folding pathways.'
