tldr: The authors present an effective many-body Hamiltonian for non-magnetic doublet systems, discussing the electronic quadrupolar state and nuclear ordered state. They argue that the driving force behind the electronic-quadrupolar state is the cooperative Jahn-Teller mechanism, while the nuclear ordered state is driven by dipolar interactions between enhanced nuclear spins.
