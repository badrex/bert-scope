tldr: The authors conducted a phenomenological analysis of the martensitic transformation in face-centered cubic manganese alloys, focusing on lattice vibrations and elastic phenomena. They discovered that the transformation is accompanied by a critical reduction of stiffness parameters and an anomalous softening of longitudinal phonons. The analysis provides insights into the material's behavior and sets the stage for further research on the topic.
