tldr: The author, Antony van Leeuwenhoek, examines tobacco ashes under a microscope and discovers various salt particles with unique shapes and structures. He also observes the process of salt extraction from the ashes and discusses the properties of the resulting salts. This research contributes to the understanding of the composition and structure of salts and the potential applications of microscopy in chemical analysis.
