tldr: The author extends the theory of isotropic turbulence in magneto-hydrodynamics, focusing on the correlations and pressure fluctuations. They show how the scalars defining these tensors can be expressed in terms of the scalars defining the second-order correlations. The study also discusses the relationship between the second-order and fourth-order correlations, and the influence of magnetic fields on turbulence and pressure fluctuations.
