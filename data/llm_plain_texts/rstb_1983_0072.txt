tldr: This article investigates the quantitative aspects of airborne foot-and-mouth disease virus dispersal, focusing on its production, carriage, and deposition. The authors review the evidence for airborne spread during past outbreaks and describe recent experimental investigations to quantify airborne virus levels excreted by different susceptible species. They also examine the influence of environmental factors such as ultraviolet light, relative humidity, and pollutants on the survival of foot-and-mouth virus in aerosols.
