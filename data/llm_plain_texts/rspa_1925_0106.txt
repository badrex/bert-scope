tldr: The author analyzes the secondary hydrogen spectrum, focusing on the lines selectively weakened in electron discharges. They discuss the properties and wave-numbers of the series, as well as the term differences and moments of inertia. The study provides insights into the structure of the hydrogen spectrum and its implications for atomic physics.
