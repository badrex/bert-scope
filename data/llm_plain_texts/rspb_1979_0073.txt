tldr: This study investigates the role of environmental factors in obesity by transplanting adipose tissue from lean and obese rodents into lean and obese recipients. The results show that environmental factors play a significant role in determining fat cell size, suggesting that genetic factors may not be the primary cause of obesity in these rodents.
