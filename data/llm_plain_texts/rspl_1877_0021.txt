tldr: The author investigates the attraction and repulsion of bubbles by heat in various liquid-filled cavities. They discovered that the movement of bubbles is influenced by the temperature and the type of liquid present. The findings have implications for understanding heat transfer and fluid dynamics in natural and artificial systems.
