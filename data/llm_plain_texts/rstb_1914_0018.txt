tldr: This article examines fossil plants from the base of the Waverley shale in Kentucky, focusing on their structure and preservation. The author identifies the primary xylem structure and discusses the presence of medullary tracheides, which are elongated elements that extend throughout the "pith." This discovery suggests that the plant's structure was protostelic, with xylem intermixed with parenchyma.
