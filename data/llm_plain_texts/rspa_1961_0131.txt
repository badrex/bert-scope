tldr: This article investigates the stability of viscous flow between rotating cylinders in the presence of a magnetic field. The authors extend the theory from a previous paper to allow for counter-rotation of the cylinders and provide explicit results for the case when the cylinders rotate in opposite directions with equal angular velocities. The study helps to determine the critical Taylor number for the onset of instability and offers insights into the behavior of fluids in the presence of magnetic fields.
