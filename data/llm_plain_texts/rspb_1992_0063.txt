tldr: The authors studied the M-current, a time- and voltage-dependent potassium current, in bullfrog sympathetic neurons. They found that the M-current has three kinetically distinct components: fast, intermediate, and slow time constants. These components are sensitive to muscarine, which can suppress the M-current and affect cell excitability.
