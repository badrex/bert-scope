tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the influence of color on heat and odor absorption. They found that the absorbing power of different colors follows the order of black, brown, green, red, yellow, and white. The author also discovered that the loss of heat by radiation follows the same order as its absorption. Additionally, the author investigated the influence of color on the absorption of odorous effluvia, finding that black cloth had the greatest absorbing powers, while white had the least.
