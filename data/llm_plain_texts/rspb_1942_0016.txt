tldr: 'This study investigates the trichromatic theory of vision by conducting experiments using an improved design of the Wright trichromatic colorimeter. The researchers analyze the generalized form of von Kries's law of coefficients and discuss possible physiological causes for its breakdown. They also attempt to locate the colors in the trichromatic color chart corresponding to the three fundamental responses and derive the response curves.'
