tldr: The author explores the connection between the ray theory of electric waves and dynamics, demonstrating that the ray theory is only valid when the radius of curvature of the ray is much larger than the wavelength. The author also discusses the limitations of the ray theory and the need to use the full wave method in certain conditions.
