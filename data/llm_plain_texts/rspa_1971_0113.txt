tldr: This study investigates the reactions of halogen oxides using flash photolysis, focusing on the production and reactions of BrO and ClO radicals in the halogen-sensitized decomposition of chlorine dioxide. The research finds that the reaction between bromine atoms and chlorine dioxide occurs through a radical mechanism, with rate constants for these reactions being considerably higher than that of the bimolecular reaction of ClO radicals. The results provide insights into the mechanisms of these reactions and contribute to the understanding of chemical kinetics and radical chemistry.
