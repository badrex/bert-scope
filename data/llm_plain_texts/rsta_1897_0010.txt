tldr: The author describes the observations and results obtained during the solar eclipse of August 9th, 1896, in Novaya Zemlya. They used a prismatic camera to capture images of the sun's spectrum and corona, which provided valuable insights into solar physics and chemistry. The photographs revealed differences in the intensities of spectral lines and the structure of the corona, contributing to a better understanding of the sun's behavior.
