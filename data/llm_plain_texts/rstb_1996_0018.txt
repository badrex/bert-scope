tldr: 'The article discusses a heterotrimeric GTPase-regulated isoform of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and its potential effectors. The authors describe the regulation of this PI3K isoform and its role in cellular signaling pathways, particularly in the activation of the small G-protein rac. The study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of intracellular signaling pathways and the potential targets of PI3K in cellular responses.'
