tldr: This article discusses nucleotide excision repair (NER) syndromes, which are caused by defects in DNA repair mechanisms. The three main syndromes are xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), Cockayne syndrome (CS), and trichothiodystrophy (TTD). The article explains the molecular basis of these syndromes and their clinical symptoms, such as hypersensitivity to ultraviolet light, skin abnormalities, and neurological dysfunction. The authors also discuss the cloning and characterization of human DNA repair genes involved in NER deficiency syndromes.
