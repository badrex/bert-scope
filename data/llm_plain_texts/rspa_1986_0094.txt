tldr: The authors investigated the infrared absorption of type Ia diamonds and found that the B' localized mode peak is related to carbon-carbon bond vibrations within platelets. Platelets are produced by the formation and aggregation of carbon interstitials, and their presence affects the lattice absorption spectrum. The study also suggests that nitrogen is not the dominant atomic species in platelets.
