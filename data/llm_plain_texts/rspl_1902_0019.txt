tldr: The author, Jagadis Chunder Bose and Lord Rayleigh, conducted experiments to study the molecular effects of light and mechanical vibration on various substances. They discovered that light and mechanical vibration produce opposite molecular effects, and the after-effect of light on sensitive substances can be made more or less permanent by overstraining or using retarding substances. This research provides a better understanding of photographic action and the role of molecular strain in various phenomena.
