revised_title: 'Influence of Bacterial Emulsion Constituents on Opsonic Index'
semantic_tags:
  - Bacterial emulsions
  - Opsonization
  - Phagocytosis
  - Detritus
  - Serum opsonic power
tldr: The authors investigated the effect of bacterial emulsion constituents, specifically bacillary detritus, on the opsonic index. They found that removing detritus from the emulsion increased phagocytosis, while adding detritus reduced it. The presence of detritus in the emulsion influenced the opsonic index, with higher amounts of detritus leading to clearer differentiation between normal and subnormal blood samples.
