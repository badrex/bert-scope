tldr: The authors studied the distribution of ions under a charged monolayer and developed a surface equation of state for charged films. They investigated the potential at a charged interface between water and oil or air and found that the potential is a function of the ionic strength of the phase. The authors used various methods to determine the potential and analyzed the distribution of counter-ions in the ionic double layer. Their findings have implications for understanding the behavior of charged films and their potential applications in biology and other fields.
