tldr: The authors developed a laboratory testing rig to simulate large structure fracture modes in materials with high fracture toughness and low yield stress, allowing for the determination of appropriate fracture toughness values. The rig enables the study of quasistatic cracking in materials such as brittle plastics, mineral glass, and aluminum alloys, providing insights into the cracking-yielding transition and the size parameter that controls it.
