tldr: This article presents a method for finding the 48 co-ordinates of a cubic curve in space. The author, William Spottiswoode, explains the process of eliminating variables from two equations representing the curve and introduces a new set of 48 co-ordinates. The number of independent co-ordinates is reduced to 12, as it should be. The article also discusses the identical relations between the U-co-ordinates and the U'-co-ordinates.
