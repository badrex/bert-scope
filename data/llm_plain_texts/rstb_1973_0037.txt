tldr: This study examines the physiological and genetic differences between two Jewish communities in Israel, the Yemenite and Kurdish Jews. The research focuses on various factors such as genetic constitution, nutrition, patterns of activity, state of health, and environmental exposure. The two communities were chosen due to their genetic dissimilarity, similar living conditions, and long periods of isolation from other Jewish communities. The findings of this study could provide insights into the effects of genetic and environmental factors on human physiological characteristics.
