tldr: This article investigates the energy loss and radiation emitted by fast charged particles, such as electrons, in the Earth's magnetic field. The author shows that the energy lost by these particles is transformed into several high-energy photons, which are distributed along a narrow band. The Earth's magnetic field mainly affects the development of extensive air showers, accelerating their growth. The study focuses on the region where the classical treatment is valid and the effect of radiation damping can be neglected.
