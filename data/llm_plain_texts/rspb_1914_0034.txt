tldr: The author investigates the enzymes responsible for the decomposition of glucose and mannitol in Bacillus coli communis. They found that the selected strain produced acid but not gas from glucose and mannitol, and that the enzymes involved in the process were different from those in the normal strain. The study highlights the importance of understanding the metabolic changes in bacteria when exposed to certain substances, such as sodium chloroacetate.
