tldr: The Western European Winter Anomaly Campaign studied the atmospheric and ionospheric coupling during pronounced disturbances of ionospheric E-region electron density. The campaign involved ground-based, balloon-borne, and rocket-borne experiments, as well as remote sensing satellite experiments. The main findings include enhanced electron densities, increased ion production rates, and low electron loss rates during winter anomaly events. The campaign provided insights into the complex interactions between the atmosphere and ionosphere and the factors influencing the winter anomaly phenomenon.
