tldr: The author investigates the physical constants of saturated solutions and their osmotic pressures, with a focus on applying Van der Waals' equation to concentrated solutions. They discuss the methods and apparatus used to measure volume, pressure, and temperature, and present findings on the densities and solubilities of various salts. The study aims to provide data for the tentative application of Van der Waals' equation to concentrated solutions, which have large osmotic pressures.
