The satellite was launched on 26 April 1962, and the experiments aimed to measure the density and temperature of electrons, the mass and temperature of atomic and molecular ions, solar activity, and primary cosmic-ray energy spectrum. The data collected provided valuable insights into space research and ionosphere studies.
