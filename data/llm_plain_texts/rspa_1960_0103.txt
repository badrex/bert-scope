tldr: This article discusses the annual variation of geomagnetic activity observed at Halley Bay during the International Geophysical Year. The authors describe the difference between the diurnal variation of geomagnetic activity in June and December, and explain the observed field changes in winter as being due to a disturbing line current in the ionosphere. The study has implications for understanding geomagnetic phenomena and their relationship with other disciplines, such as ionospheric work and auroral results.
