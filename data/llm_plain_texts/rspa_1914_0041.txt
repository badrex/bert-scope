tldr: The author examines the origin of thermal ionization from carbon and the influence of gaseous atmospheres on ionization. They discuss the limitations of previous experiments and propose that the presence of a gaseous atmosphere can affect the number of ions collected by the positive electrode through mechanical interference and direct combination of electrons with gas molecules. The author concludes that while the presence of gas may influence ionization, it does not necessarily invalidate theories regarding the physical properties of hot solids.
