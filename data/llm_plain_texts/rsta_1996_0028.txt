tldr: This article discusses the state-of-the-art of nonlinear optical materials suitable for ultrafast all-optical applications. It covers progress in the third-order nonlinear properties of semiconductors, polymers, and glasses and their applications to devices. The article also explores a second-order nonlinearity-based approach called "cascading" for all-optical effects. The focus is on applications that involve manipulating signals, such as all-optical logic, routing functions, and wavelength shifting, which are essential for high bit rate communications.
