tldr: The authors study the diffraction of stress waves by a finite plane crack in two-dimensional elastic solids. They prove the uniqueness of the solution and provide a constructive proof of existence using a new class of Green functions. The solution is given in terms of the solution of a class of Fredholm integral equations of the second kind.
