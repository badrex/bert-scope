tldr: The authors investigate the crystal growth behavior of the organic nonlinear optical material 2-(Î±-methylbenzylamino)-5-nitropyridine (MBANP) and develop techniques for preparing large, high-quality single crystals. They study the effects of supersaturation and solvent on crystal growth and use X-ray diffraction topography to assess the structural quality of the resulting crystals. The techniques described enable further optical, dielectric, ultrasonic, and piezoelectric studies and device fabrication.
