tldr: The author investigates the relationship between the atomic weight term and the constitution of spectral series. They find that the constant quantity connected with each element plays a crucial role in the formation of its spectrum. The study also shows that the series may not depend directly on a formula involving the atomic weight, but rather on the addition or subtraction of multiples of the atomic weight term. This discovery could potentially lead to more accurate atomic weight determinations and improve the understanding of spectral series.
