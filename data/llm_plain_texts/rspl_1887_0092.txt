semantic_tags:

tldr: The author investigates the influence of temperature on the dispersion of light and its relation to the chemical structure of compounds. They find that the dispersion equivalent, a measure of a compound's ability to disperse light, is primarily determined by the atomic constitution of the substance. The author also discovers that the dispersion of a compound can reveal differences in its constitution that are not recognized by chemists or expressed in existing formulas.
