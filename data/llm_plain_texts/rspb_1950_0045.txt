tldr: 'The article discusses the application of phase-contrast to ultra-violet microscopy, enabling the visualization of minute structural details in transparent biological objects. The method converts phase changes in transmitted light into changes of amplitude, allowing for better contrast and resolution in images. This technique has significant potential for studying living cells and their structures, as well as for cytochemical research.'
