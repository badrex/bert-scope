tldr: The authors conducted e.s.r. studies to understand the role of free radicals in coal conversion processes. They found that free radical concentrations and values in coals are determined by their rank, and that pyrolysis causes a marked increase in these concentrations. The authors also discovered that the effectiveness of solvents in quenching free radicals during liquefaction depends on their ability to lose hydrogen and form stable unsaturated species. These findings provide insights into coal structure and conversion mechanisms.
