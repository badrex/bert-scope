tldr: The authors calculate the intensities and mean lives of certain nebular lines emitted by atoms in galactic nebulae. They find that their calculated relative intensities match observed intensities in the nebulae, and the calculated mean lives provide insights into the physical conditions in the nebulae. The study confirms Bowen's hypothesis that certain prominent lines in nebular spectra are due to transitions from metastable states in certain ions.
