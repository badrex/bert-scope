tldr: This paper presents a simplified mathematical proof of the law of errors in observations, based on the hypothesis that errors arise from the joint operation of numerous independent sources. The author demonstrates how this hypothesis can be applied to the refined observations of modern astronomers, providing a more general and elementary approach than previous methods by Laplace and Poisson.
