tldr: The author examines the abrupt transition from rest to activity in muscle fibers by applying quick stretches at various moments after a maximal shock. They discover that there is an abrupt change of state, with the contractile component suddenly becoming capable of bearing a load equal to the maximum tension set up in an isometric tetanus. The study provides insights into the mechanical properties of striated muscle and the process of muscle fiber activation.
