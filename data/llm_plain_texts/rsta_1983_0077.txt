tldr: This article discusses the development of composite materials based on cement matrices, focusing on fiber-reinforced cement and concrete (FRC). It explores the properties and potential applications of FRC, including the use of glass, polypropylene, and cellulose fibers, as well as metal wire. The article also examines the mechanical properties and behavior of FRC materials, as well as their potential to replace asbestos products.
