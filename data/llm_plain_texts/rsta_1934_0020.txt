tldr: The authors investigated the spectra of singly and doubly ionized sulphur in the wavelength range of 3300-4900 Ã…. They used a discharge tube method to obtain accurate and impurity-free spectra. The study aimed to improve the understanding of sulphur's atomic spectra and its importance in astrophysics.
