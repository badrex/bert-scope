tldr: This study investigates the flow of a linearly stratified fluid over a long ridge in a rotating channel. The research focuses on understanding the effects of topography and rotation on the fluid flow, which has implications for meteorological situations such as the flow over large-scale ridge-like features like the Rocky Mountains and mesoscale features like the Sierra Nevada Mountains.
