tldr: The authors studied the thermal conductivity of solid mixtures of helium isotopes and found that the relaxation rate for isotopic impurities is greater than the rate corresponding to mass difference alone. This is due to the effect of lattice strain around the impurity. The results are analyzed using Callaway's relaxation-time theory, providing a consistent explanation for the observed behavior.
