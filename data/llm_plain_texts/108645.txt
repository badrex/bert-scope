tldr: Eaton Hodgkinson conducted extensive experiments to determine the strength of cast iron pillars used in building construction. He found that the strength of these pillars varied depending on their size, shape, and the type of iron used. His research provided valuable insights into the design and construction of buildings, warehouses, and other structures that rely on iron supports.
