tldr: Dr. Hermann de Schlagintweit presents a study on Indian meteorology, focusing on isothermal lines between latitudes of 5Â°. The research is based on meteorological observations made by various observers in 207 stations across British India. The author discusses the processes of reduction for each geographical group and highlights his special qualification to use these observations advantageously due to his personal visits to most of the stations.
