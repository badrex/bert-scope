tldr: 'This article discusses the factors that contribute to plant extinction, focusing on the importance of pollinator and disperser interactions. The author proposes a method to assess the risk of plant extinction by considering the probability of dispersal or pollinator failure, reproductive dependence on mutualism, and demographic dependence on seeds. The article highlights the need to understand these factors to prevent a potential wave of plant extinctions caused by the collapse of pollinator and disperser interactions.'
