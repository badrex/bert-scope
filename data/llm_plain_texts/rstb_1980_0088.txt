tldr: The authors studied the perception of apparent movement by manipulating the similarity and timing of successive images. They discovered that human motion perception involves two separate mechanisms: a peripheral system that detects local point-by-point correlations and a more cognitive system that analyzes global correspondences and extracts edges before processing motion. The study helps to understand how the visual system processes motion and perceives continuous motion from a set of discrete stimuli.
