revised_title: 'Investigation of Canal Rays and Their Mechanical Effects'
semantic_tags:
  - Canal rays
  - Electrified particles
  - Mechanical pressure
  - Mill-wheel rotation
  - Radiometer action
tldr: The authors conducted experiments to discover if canal rays, discovered by Goldstein, have the same mechanical properties as cathode rays. They found that canal rays do cause mica mill-wheels to rotate rapidly, and that the effect is likely due to the rays making the vanes hotter on one side than the other, causing a radiometer action. This demonstrates the motion of positively electrified particles in canal rays.
