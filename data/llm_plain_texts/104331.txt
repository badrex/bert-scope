tldr: A 70-year-old man, Thomas Halsey, experienced two severe coughing fits that resulted in the expulsion of part of his lungs. Upon examination, it was found that the left lobe of his lungs was torn and detached from the surrounding membranes. The case study highlights the remarkable resilience of the human body and the limited sensitivity of the lungs, as Halsey experienced little pain despite the significant damage.
