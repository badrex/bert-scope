tldr: The authors conducted experiments on fuel-rich, atmospheric-pressure, laminar, premixed flames with added calcium, strontium, and barium to study their flame chemistry. They interpreted the results in terms of gas-phase reactions involving the additive species and flame species, such as OH and. The study provides a comprehensive description of alkaline earth flame chemistry, which differs from previous interpretations, particularly regarding non-equilibrium effects. Thermochemical data for key reactions are tabulated.
