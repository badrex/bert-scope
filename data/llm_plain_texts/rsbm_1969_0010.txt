tldr: James Ernest Richey was a renowned geologist who specialized in the study of central igneous complexes, particularly in the British Tertiary Province. He began his career with the Geological Survey of Great Britain, where he conducted groundbreaking research on the central ring-complexes of Mull. Later, he worked on the western end of the Ardnamurchan peninsula, distinguishing three successive ring-centers and contributing to the understanding of Tertiary volcanic centers. Richey's work significantly advanced the understanding of volcanic mechanisms and the formation of ring-dykes and cone-sheets.
