tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effects of electric light on plant growth and fruit ripening. They found that electric light accelerates the ripening process in strawberries and promotes the growth of plants. The results suggest that electric light can be used to produce high-quality fruit at any time of the year, making horticulturists independent of solar light. The author also discovered that the electric light's influence extends to plants at a considerable distance.
