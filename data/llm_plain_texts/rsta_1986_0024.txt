revised_title: 'Influence of Crustal Lineaments on Intracontinental Seismicity and Geological History'
semantic_tags:
  - Seismicity
  - Continental crust
  - Fault zones
  - Crustal lineaments
  - Geothermal analysis
tldr: This article investigates the relationship between major crustal lineaments, intracontinental seismicity, and the geological history of the continental lithosphere. It examines the distribution of earthquakes on lineaments and how stress patterns affect fault zones. The study also explores the role of temperature and viscosity in crustal units and the ductility of the continental lower crust.
