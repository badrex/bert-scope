tldr: The author observed the transit of Venus across the Sun on December 9, 1874, from the Himalayas. They used the Royal Society's equatorial telescope to study the event and describe the phenomena they witnessed, including the behavior of Venus's sun-limb and sky-limb, and the appearance of a ring of light around them. The author also discussed the weather conditions and the lack of a "pear-drop" and "sliver" phenomenon during the transit.
