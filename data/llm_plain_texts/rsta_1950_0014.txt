tldr: The authors investigate the westward drift of the Earth's magnetic field, focusing on the non-dipole part and its secular variation between 1907 and 1945. They find a real drift with an angular velocity independent of latitude, and explain it as a consequence of the dynamo theory of the Earth's magnetic field origin. This theory requires the outer part of the core to rotate slower than the inner part, causing the solid mantle of the Earth to be coupled to the core and the outer part of the core to travel westward, carrying the minor features of the field with it.
