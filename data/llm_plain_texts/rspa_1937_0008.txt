tldr: The authors studied the fine structure in the arc spectrum of platinum to determine the nuclear spin of the isotope Pt 195. They found that the central component of the spectrum was split into three due to even isotope displacement, and they analyzed the fine structures of thirty-six lines in the region XX 6800-4320. The results showed satisfactory agreement with previous studies, providing insights into the atomic structure and properties of platinum isotopes.
