revised_title: 'Chromatin Structure and Transcription: The Role of DNase II and Mg2+ Soluble Chromatin'
semantic_tags:
  - Chromatin structure
  - Transcription
  - DNase II
  - Mg2+ soluble chromatin
  - Chromatin fractionation
tldr: The article discusses the organization of transcribed regions of chromatin and the role of endonuclease DNase II in attacking specific portions of chromosomal DNA. The Mg2+ soluble fraction is found to be enriched in sequences coding for cytoplasmic poly(A)-containing RNA and globin messenger RNA. The study also presents a procedure for chromatin fractionation using DNase II and Mg2+ to separate active and inactive chromatin regions.
