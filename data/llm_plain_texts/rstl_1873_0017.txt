tldr: The author, the Earl of Rosse, conducted a series of experiments to determine the amount of heat coming to Earth from the moon and the nature of the heat's average refrangibility. They observed the moon at various zenith distances and altitudes, measuring the heat effect and absorption of the moon's heat in its passage through the Earth's atmosphere. The results were used to create a table for the extinction of the moon's radiant heat, showing that the extinction follows a similar law to that of stellar light but is not as significant at considerable zenith distances.
