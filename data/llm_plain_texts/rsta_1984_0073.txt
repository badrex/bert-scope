tldr: The author discusses the connection between constructive mathematics and programming languages, specifically focusing on intuitionistic type theory. They argue that intuitionistic type theory can be viewed as a programming language due to its ability to precisely codify constructive mathematics and provide a formal notation for both programs and their tasks. The author also highlights the similarities between programming and mathematics, emphasizing the importance of formal notation in both fields.
