tldr: This article discusses the most suitable time for felling timber for shipbuilding and other construction purposes. The author compares the traditional methods of felling timber in the South of England with those in Staffordshire and neighboring counties. The author argues that felling timber in the spring season leads to weaker and less durable wood, while felling in the autumn or winter results in stronger and more resilient timber. The article also explores the methods of bark removal and the impact of exposure to wind and sunlight on the durability of the wood.
