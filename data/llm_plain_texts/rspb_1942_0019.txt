tldr: This study examines the development of bristles in normal and mutant types of Drosophila melanogaster. The research describes the process of bristle formation, focusing on the roles of trichogen and tormogen cells. The authors also analyze the effects of various genes on bristle development, including scute, split, dichaete, hairless, stubble, shaven-naked, spineless, morula, singed, forked, and bristle. The findings provide insights into the genetic and developmental aspects of bristle formation in Drosophila.
