tldr: The authors examine three meteorites from Cranbourne, Rowton, and Middlesbrough, analyzing their composition and structure. They discover that the meteorites are made entirely of metallic minerals, primarily nickel-iron alloys, and identify a new mineral called Edmondsonite, which is a magnetic, white, and pliant substance found in the meteorites. The authors also discuss the oxidation and decay of the meteorites and their significance in the study of meteorites.
