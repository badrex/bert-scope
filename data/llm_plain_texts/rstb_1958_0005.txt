tldr: This article discusses the ecology and formation of lagoons along the Guinea Coast of West Africa. It explores the distribution of lagoons in relation to the coast-line and dominant wind direction, and identifies two types of lagoons based on the presence or absence of large rivers. The study also examines the role of sand movement and beach accretion in the formation and expansion of lagoons, and the impact of these changes on the surrounding fauna and flora.
