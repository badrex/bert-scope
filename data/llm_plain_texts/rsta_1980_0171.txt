revised_title: 'The Early Evolution and Formation of Galaxies: Gravitational Theories and Observational Tests'
semantic_tags:
  - Galaxy formation
  - Gravitational instability
  - Adiabatic perturbations
  - Isothermal perturbations
  - Dark matter
tldr: This article discusses two gravitational theories for galaxy formation: isothermal density perturbation and adiabatic density perturbation. It explores how these theories describe the process of galaxy formation and how they can be tested using observations. The article also touches upon the role of dark matter in galaxy formation and the challenges of understanding galaxy clustering.
