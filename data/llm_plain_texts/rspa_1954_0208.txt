revised_title: 'Surface Diffusion and Melting Point of Stearic Acid Monolayers'
semantic_tags:
  - Surface diffusion
  - Monolayers
  - Stearic acid
  - Mica
  - Melting point
tldr: The authors studied the process of surface diffusion and overturning of stearic acid monolayers on mica. They discovered a melting point for stearic acid monolayers on mica and found that the energy of activation for diffusion is 42 and below. The authors also compared the diffusion of stearic acid on different metals and discussed the transfer process in these systems.
