tldr: This article discusses the limitations of the 50/500 rule in conservation biology, which states that populations should have no fewer than 50 individuals for short-term maintenance of genetic variation and no fewer than 500 individuals for long-term maintenance. The author argues that these numbers are often invalid and misleading, and instead suggests that conservation biologists should recognize the role of biodiversity in management policies and consider novel approaches rather than relying on universal rules.
