tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the behavior of tuned rectangular frame aerials when receiving short waves. They discovered that the maximum current produced by the incidence of short wireless waves on a tuned rectangular frame aerial is very dependent on the dimensions of the frame. The authors developed a theory to explain these anomalous effects and tested it experimentally, finding that there are optimum dimensions for each area of the frame to achieve maximum current.
