tldr: The study examines the spatial variation in CO2 uptake within intact leaves and its significance in understanding the effects of environmental stress on photosynthesis. Techniques such as small chambers and simultaneous measurements of CO2, NaO, and HaO vapour allow for a separation of contributions made by different parts of the leaf to total CO2 uptake. The research focuses on Zea mays leaves, exploring heterogeneity in responses to light and internal air-space CO2 pressure fraction, as well as heterogeneity in susceptibility to photoinhibition during chilling.
