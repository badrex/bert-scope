tldr: The authors conducted a study on holmium vanadate using nuclear magnetic resonance to investigate its properties as a Van Vleck paramagnet. They found that the nuclear Zeeman interaction is greatly enhanced through the hyperfine interaction, and determined the parameters of the nuclear Hamiltonian. The study also analyzed the line width and quadrupole interaction, and estimated the anisotropy of the material.
