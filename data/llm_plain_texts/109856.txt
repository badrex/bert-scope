tldr: In 1811, A.F. Mornay discovered a large mass of native iron in Brazil, which was initially found in 1784. The iron block was highly magnetic and estimated to weigh around 14,000 pounds. Mornay also found a trace of nickel in the iron and observed a luminous plant with an acrid juice. The area was rich in geological features, including sandstone hills and conical hills inhabited by white ants.
