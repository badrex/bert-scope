tldr: The author, Robert Porrett, investigates the nature of salts called triple prussiates and the acids formed by combining certain elements with prussic acid. He proposes that these salts are binary, consisting of a single base and a complex acid containing iron and prussic acid elements. The author also discovers that substances like sulfur can form unique acids with prussic acid elements, leading to the creation of Chyazic acids. These findings contribute to a better understanding of acid-base chemistry and the properties of prussian blue.
