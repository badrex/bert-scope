tldr: This study investigates the surface potentials of dibasic esters, alcohols, aldoximes, and ketones. The researchers found that the surface potential does not depend on the closeness of packing of the molecules, as long as their orientation remains unchanged. The results suggest that the dielectric constant of the film is not affected by the crowding of the dipoles of the molecules. The main conclusion is that in gaseous films, the surface potential does not depend on the closeness of packing of the molecules, provided their orientation is not forcibly changed.
