tldr: The author, David Brewster, conducted experiments on the refractive and dispersive powers of various substances. He discovered that light transmitted through Iceland-spar and reflected light exhibited polarization. He also observed a unique color phenomenon in laminated agate and found that the colorless light transmitted through the agate was polarized. Brewster also discussed the high refractive power of chromate of lead and the existence of two dispersive powers in all doubly refracting media.
