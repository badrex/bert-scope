tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the normal viscosity of liquid helium II using heat conduction in capillary tubes. They found that the viscosity at low temperatures follows the theory of Landau and Khalatnikov, but the measured values of the slip correction were slightly larger than expected from theoretical phonon and roton mean free paths. This study provides insights into the behavior of helium II and its implications for understanding the properties of this unique fluid.
