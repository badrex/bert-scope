tldr: This article demonstrates that stomata, small openings on plant leaves, are the primary pathway for gas exchange in plants. The authors conducted experiments to show that carbon dioxide enters and exits the leaf through stomata, while cuticular exchange plays a minimal role. This finding is important for understanding how plants absorb carbon dioxide for photosynthesis and release waste gases like carbon dioxide.
