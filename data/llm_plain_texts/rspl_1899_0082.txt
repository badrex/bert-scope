tldr: The author analyzes the spectra of Piscian stars, which have predominant carbon absorption, and classifies them into seven species based on their spectral characteristics. They discuss the differences in spectra, such as the number of zones and the presence of secondary bands, and explain how these differences can be related to temperature variations and the cooling of meteoritic vapours.
