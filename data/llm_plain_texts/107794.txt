tldr: The author, James South, conducted observations of 458 double and triple stars between 1823 and 1825, with a re-examination of 36 previously studied stars. These observations aimed to determine the apparent distances and positions of these stars, as well as their proper motions. The findings have implications for understanding the nature of double stars, their positions, and the potential for parallax measurements. This work contributes to the broader field of astronomy and our understanding of the stars and their movements in the sky.
