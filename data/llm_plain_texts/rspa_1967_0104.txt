tldr: This article examines the high-temperature neutron diffraction measurements of fluorite structures, using a generalized structure factor approach that recognizes the antisymmetric properties of atoms in non-centrosymmetric lattice sites. The authors develop an anharmonic vibration formalism for effective one-particle potential fields and analyze the neutron data, finding that certain unusual features of the observations are accounted for by the antisymmetric components associated with the tetrahedral point symmetry of the anionic sites. The derived parameters reproduce the experimental observations over a wide range of elevated temperatures.
