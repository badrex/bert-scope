tldr: The authors studied the interaction between protein antigens and synthetic site-directed ligands using X-ray analysis. They observed conformational changes in both the ligands and proteins during binding, which could help in understanding the 'lock and key' or 'induced fit' models of ligand-protein interactions. The research focused on the immune recognition of a specific Fab (BV04-01) and a human Bence-Jones dimer, providing insights into the binding properties and structures of these proteins.
