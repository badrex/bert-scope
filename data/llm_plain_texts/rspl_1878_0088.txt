tldr: The author presents an easy and accurate method for determining the ratio of dispersion in glasses used for objectives, focusing on the construction of telescopes. The method involves using two prisms, one of crown glass and one of flint glass, and observing the secondary tints to ensure the best results in practice. This method allows for better achromatization and improved telescope performance.
