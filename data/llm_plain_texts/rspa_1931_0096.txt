tldr: 'The authors examine the effect of deep focus on reflected waves from earthquakes. They analyze the times of transit for both supplementary and normal waves, finding that the commencement of additional phases can generally be recognized on seismograms, and the times of transit are in reasonable agreement with calculated times. This provides definitive confirmation of the occurrence of deep focus earthquakes and offers a means of identifying them from records of a single station.'
