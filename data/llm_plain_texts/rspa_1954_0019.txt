tldr: This article studies the unsteady non-homentropic flow of a gas in one dimension following a normal shock of varying strength. The author presents an exact solution representing progressive waves and applies it to the problem of a shock advancing into a region with varying density and pressure. The discussion focuses on the case of a very strong shock, providing qualitative conclusions and a differential equation for further analysis.
