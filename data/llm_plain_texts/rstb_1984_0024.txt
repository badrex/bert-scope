tldr: The article discusses the structure, composition, and biosynthesis of soybean storage protein glycinin. It describes the subunits, molecular mass, and the disulphide linkages between the acidic and basic polypeptide components. The study also highlights the differences in primary structures and the non-random pairing of the polypeptide components, as well as the role of null alleles in the assembly of glycinin molecules.
