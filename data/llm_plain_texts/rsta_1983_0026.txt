tldr: The article discusses the properties and applications of thermotropic liquid crystal side-chain polymers, which combine polymer-specific properties with the anisotropic behavior of liquid crystals. The author focuses on the influence of the degree of polymerization and the state of order in these polymers, comparing them with low molecular mass liquid crystals. The article highlights the potential applications of these materials, such as optical storage and the production of anisotropic materials.
