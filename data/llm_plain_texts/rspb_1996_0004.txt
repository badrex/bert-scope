tldr: 'This study examines how different populations of birds adapt their egg-laying timing based on variations in photoresponsiveness. Researchers found that captive blue tits exposed to increased photoperiod in winter started laying eggs 1-4 months earlier than under natural conditions. The results suggest that differences in photoresponsiveness play a significant role in determining the timing of reproduction in bird populations.'
