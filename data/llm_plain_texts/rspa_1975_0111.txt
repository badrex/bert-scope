tldr: The authors studied the absorption spectrum of Tl I vapor in the vacuum ultraviolet range and observed new structure associated with the excitation of the 4f subshell. They also found a broad transmission window, similar to the one previously reported in the absorption spectrum of Hg I. The results have important implications for the interpretation of photo-ionization curves and the understanding of the transmission window in heavy atoms.
