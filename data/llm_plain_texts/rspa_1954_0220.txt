tldr: The structure of hydrazoic acid is described in terms of bond order, formal charge, and molecular orbital theory. Calculations using the molecular orbital method show that the bond orders in hydrazoic acid are N-N and N-N. The charge distribution on the N and N atoms is found to be +0.5 and -0.8e, respectively. The calculated values of interatomic distances and the heat of formation agree with the experimental values. The study provides insights into the factors affecting chemical bond formation and the importance of resonance in determining the structure of complex molecules.
