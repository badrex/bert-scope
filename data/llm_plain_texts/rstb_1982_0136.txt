tldr: The study examines the sensory innervation and structure of muscle spindles in cat hindlimbs. It investigates the form and distribution of sensory terminals in different muscle fiber types, including bag1, bag2, and chain fibers. The research uses reconstruction, electron microscopy, and analysis of silver preparations to understand the innervation patterns and functional significance of muscle spindles in various muscles.
