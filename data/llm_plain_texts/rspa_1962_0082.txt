tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the deformation and burst of fluid drops in electric and shear fields. They found that the deformation of conducting drops into prolate spheroids agreed with theoretical equations based on electrostatic theory, while dielectric drops showed deviations. The mode of electrical burst depended on the ratio of the velocity gradient to the electric field strength, interfacial tension, and the ratios of dielectric constants and viscosities of the two liquids.
