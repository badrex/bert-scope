tldr: The study investigates the changes in enzyme balances in bacterial cells that develop drug resistance through physiological adaptation. The results show that drug-resistant cells have an altered enzyme balance, with some enzymes being expanded or reduced. The findings suggest that drug adaptation causes significant changes in the general enzyme balance, which may involve the development of enzymes to destroy or neutralize the drug, expansion of enzymes that increase the internal supply of competing metabolites, or alterations in the balance of several enzymes to favor reaction paths less susceptible to drug interference.
