tldr: The authors conducted a comprehensive kinetic study of the polymerization of acrylonitrile, focusing on the behavior of free radicals in heterogeneous systems. They discovered that the reaction rate increases with time, and the molecular weights of polymers prepared at different temperatures show a maximum. The authors propose that the propagating free radicals become occluded in polymer aggregates during polymerization, affecting the rate coefficients and explaining the observed phenomena.
