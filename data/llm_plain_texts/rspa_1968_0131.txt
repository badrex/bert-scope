tldr: The authors developed a discrete atom model to study the nucleation and growth of interstitial aggregates in iron. They found that interstitials initially aggregate on specific crystallographic planes and observed changes in the structure and orientation of the aggregates during their growth. This research provides a consistent explanation for the formation and orientation of interstitial loops in iron after low-temperature neutron irradiation.
