tldr: This article explores the relationship between calcium concentrations in xylem sap and stomatal behavior in plants. High calcium concentrations in the xylem can lead to reduced stomatal opening, and the regulation of calcium delivery to the transpiration stream is crucial for proper stomatal function. The roots may play a significant role in controlling calcium delivery to the xylem, and disturbances in stomatal behavior can contribute to the physiological problems of plants in the presence of high rhizospheric calcium.
