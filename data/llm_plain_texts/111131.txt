tldr: The author presents a new explanation for the mysterious circles phenomenon, where a card is levitated and fixed by air currents. He suggests that the air is reflected and rises, carrying the interposing atmosphere and excluding the surrounding air, creating suction that draws up and fixes the card. This phenomenon is more powerful when the fixed card is larger than the other.
