tldr: This article presents a systematic mathematical study of the equations of motion of an aeroplane, focusing on longitudinal and three-dimensional phugoids. The author introduces a method of successive approximations to find first approximations for various types of aeroplane motions, including Lanchester's phugoids, extended phugoids, and three-dimensional phugoids, which give the Immelmann turn. The study aims to improve our understanding of aeroplane dynamics and provide a foundation for further research in the field.
