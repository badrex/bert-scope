tldr: This article discusses the multiple scattering of waves by weak random irregularities in the medium, extending the idea of single scattering and using the equation of energy transfer to describe the variation of average intensity in a randomly inhomogeneous medium. The author examines the conditions under which the single-scattering solution is valid and applies the cross-section obtained from the single-scattering solution to the scattering of energy confined to a small solid angle of directions at any point in the medium.
