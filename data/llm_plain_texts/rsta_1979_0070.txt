tldr: The article presents the orbit determination and analysis of Cosmos 462, a satellite launched in 1971. The authors used radar and optical observations to determine the orbital parameters and analyzed the variations in inclination and eccentricity to evaluate geopotential harmonic coefficients and the atmospheric rotation rate. The study also provides values of the atmospheric density scale height and assesses the accuracy of observing stations.
