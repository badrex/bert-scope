tldr: The authors present an exact method for solving unsteady convective diffusion boundary-value problems, focusing on dispersion from a prescribed concentration distribution in time variable flow. They demonstrate the method by analyzing dispersion from a partial step change at the inlet to a tube in steady laminar flow, providing a solution for the mean concentration distribution.
