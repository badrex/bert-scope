tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the influence of stress and strain on the physical properties of matter, specifically focusing on the moduli of elasticity and thermal capacity of various metals. They found that thermal capacity increases with temperature and that the rate of increase varies with the nature of the metal. The research also showed a relationship between thermal expansibility, thermal capacity, and bulk-modulus of elasticity.
