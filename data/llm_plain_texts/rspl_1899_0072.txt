tldr: This study investigates the morphology of blastomycetes found in carcinomata, confirming the presence of these organisms in breast and uterine carcinomata. The research focuses on isolating the organisms through culture, studying their staining reactions, and examining their morphological characters. The findings contribute to understanding the role of blastomycetes in cancer development and the tumor microenvironment.
