tldr: This article introduces the eigensymbol theory for representing vectors and matrices in Fermi systems. It develops a Feynman principle for these systems, showing how it can be formulated using eigensymbols and anticommuting canonical sets. The theory is applied to a simple Fermi oscillator, and the article concludes by discussing the classical analogue of the quantum Hamiltonian.
