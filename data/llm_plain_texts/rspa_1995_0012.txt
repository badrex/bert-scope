tldr: The authors propose a scale-invariant gravitational theory in the quasi-steady-state cosmology, explaining the genesis of the cosmological constant and the instability of Planck particles. They suggest that particle creation must be of an explosive nature and occur in the neighborhoods of highly compacted bodies, connecting cosmological theory with high-energy astrophysics.
