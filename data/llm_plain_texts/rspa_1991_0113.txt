tldr: The authors study the microwave loss in granular high temperature superconductors, using an effective medium theory that includes generalizations of classical My scattering theory for spherical superconductor grains and improvements due to electromagnetic coupling. They find that the loss for high-quality granular thin films is independent of frequency, suggesting that the current performance is unlikely to be significantly surpassed. The results confirm that the millimeter band is likely to remain the highest frequency region attractive for microwave applications.
