tldr: The author examines the structure and function of respiratory organs in various animals, including lampreys, lamperns, and other species, to understand the evolutionary development of respiration systems in the animal kingdom. They describe the differences in respiratory organs among different species and how these adaptations relate to the animals' habitats and feeding habits. This study contributes to the understanding of the uniform gradation of structures in the animal kingdom and the development of a general system of comparative anatomy.
