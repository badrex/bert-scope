tldr: The authors discovered that chlorophyll fluorescence quenching in anaerobic chloroplasts is a photosystem II effect. They found that inhibitors blocking electron flow between photosystems II and I increase fluorescence and prevent quenching. The study suggests that a main part of anaerobic fluorescence quenching is caused by the accumulation of reduced phaeophytin, which is prevented by electron transport inhibitors acting between photosystem II and I.
