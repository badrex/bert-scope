tldr: The authors calculated the quadrupole polarizabilities and nuclear shielding factors of the helium sequence using a combination of variational and perturbation methods. The results suggest that simpler methods used for computing polarizabilities are satisfactory, but less accurate for computing shielding factors. The study provides a more refined treatment of the helium sequence, which is important for understanding atomic systems and their interactions with external charges.
