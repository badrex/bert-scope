tldr: The authors study conical flows of fluid with variable viscosity and discover that a self-swirling jet flow develops when rotational friction is absent at the plane. This phenomenon can serve as a simple hydrodynamic model for some astrophysical and geophysical phenomena, such as jets near young stars and galaxy cores, as well as convergent wind-driven ocean currents.
