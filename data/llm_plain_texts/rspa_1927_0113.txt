revised_title: Total Ionisation and Average Energy Expenditure in Air Absorption of Slow Cathode Rays

tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the average ionisation produced by the absorption of slow cathode rays in air. They determined the average energy expenditure associated with the formation of a pair of ions and found that the average expenditure of electronic energy per pair of ions exceeded the ionisation potential, indicating that processes other than ionisation contribute to the dissipation of the initial kinetic energy of the electrons.
