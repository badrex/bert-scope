tldr: The authors studied the effect of ionizing radiation on unsaturated polyesters, discovering that it initiates polymerization and crosslinking between polyester chains. They found that the polymerization process occurs through a free-radical chain mechanism, and the degree of crosslinking or degradation depends on the total radiation dose rather than the radiation intensity. The authors also investigated the effects of various factors, such as additives, oxygen, and temperature, on the polymerization process.
