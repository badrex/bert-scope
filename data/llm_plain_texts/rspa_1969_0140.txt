tldr: This article describes the design and operation of a photoelectric pyrometer used to establish the temperature scale above the gold point. The International Practical Temperature Scale of 1948 was defined using the pyrometer, which compared two sources by placing them in the path of the detecting system. The effective wavelength of the system was set at about 660 nm using an interference filter with a bandwidth of about 12.5 nm. The temperature scale was realized in terms of the current passing through the black-body lamps. The sectored disks used for measuring energy ratios were calibrated using the time-ratio method, which is described in detail in the article. The new scale determined by this method is estimated to reproduce the I.P.T.S. to within a few degrees at the gold point and at other temperatures.
