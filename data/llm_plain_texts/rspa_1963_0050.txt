tldr: This study investigates heat flow in the Southern Karroo region through seven deep boreholes. The authors found that heat flow increases with depth and discovered that the effects of topography, uplift, and erosion on upper limit estimates are small compared to the observed variations. Reduction of air temperature during ice ages supports the observed heat flow patterns, suggesting that climatic changes may be the primary cause of the variations. The authors estimate equilibrium heat flows and discuss the implications of their findings for the region's geology and climate.
