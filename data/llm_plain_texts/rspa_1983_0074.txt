tldr: 'This article presents two methods for measuring scattering losses in thin dielectric films, using lateral wave and waveguide mode propagation. The methods were applied to magnesium fluoride and zinc sulphide films, investigating the dependence of scattering losses on deposition conditions. The results provide insights into the optical properties and potential applications of these films.'
