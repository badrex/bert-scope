tldr: This article reviews the geophysical constraints on the deep structure of the Tibetan Plateau, the Himalayas, and the Karakoram, and their tectonic implications. The authors discuss the thick crust beneath Tibet, the dynamic uppermost mantle, and the tectonic evolution of the region resulting from the collision of the Indian subcontinent with the rest of Eurasia. The study provides insights into the processes that created the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau, which are essential for understanding the formation of other mountain ranges and plateaus on Earth.
