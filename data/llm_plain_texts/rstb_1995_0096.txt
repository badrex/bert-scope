tldr: The authors present a molecular phylogeny for the zebrafish (Danio rerio) and 20 of its close relatives, based on homologous regions of the large (16S) and small (12S) mitochondrial ribosomal RNA genes. They argue that studying these closely related species in an explicitly phylogenetic context can help predict and characterize differences in developmental processes responsible for species differences and evolutionary trends. This connection between ontogeny and phylogeny can lead to a better understanding of developmental and evolutionary biology.
