tldr: The author presents a refined superposition solution method for analyzing radiative scattering in multiple sphere configurations. By simplifying the formulation and computation of addition theorems, this method enables efficient implementation of the order-of-scattering solution technique. The study focuses on the scattering cross section, extinction cross section, and absorption cross section of the ensemble, providing valuable insights for understanding light scattering in complex systems.
