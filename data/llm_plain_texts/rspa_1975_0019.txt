tldr: This article explores the phenomenon of degenerate modes in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide, particularly for radio waves in the v.l.f. or e.l.f. range. The authors study the properties of the system when conditions are near to degeneracy, discussing the consequences of this phenomenon on mode numbering, self-orthogonality, excitation factors, and reflexion coefficients.
