tldr: The author presents an in-depth analysis of the asymptotic expansions of Bessel functions for large orders. They discuss the mathematical methods used to derive these expansions and provide tables of numerical values for various Bessel functions. This work is essential for understanding the behavior of Bessel functions in applied mathematics and engineering.
