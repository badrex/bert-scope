tldr: This study examines the semidiurnal internal tides in the western North Atlantic during the Mid-Ocean Dynamics Experiment (MODE-I) in 1973. The research focuses on the energy content, bandwidth, and persistence of internal waves, as well as their propagation characteristics and potential energy sources. The findings reveal a dominant first baroclinic mode and a significant presence of deterministic internal tides, with the Blake Escarpment potentially acting as a major generation area for these waves.
