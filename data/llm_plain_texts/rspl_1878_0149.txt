tldr: The author conducted experiments using a Siemens dynamo-electric machine to study the spectral phenomena in the electric arc. They observed new and beautiful phenomena, including the differences in spectra between the positive and negative poles of the arc. The author also discovered a method to separate basic from non-basic lines in the spectra, providing valuable insights into the effects of temperature and electricity on the behavior of metal vapors.
