tldr: The article presents a genetic model that shows how male displays can evolve as a consequence of female choice even when the display is not the immediate object of choice. When females base their preferences on variance in a cue correlated with male viability, a rare display can evolve to fixation if it amplifies the differences in males, increasing the resolution power of females with respect to the original cue. This can lead to the evolution of choice based on the display's expression.
