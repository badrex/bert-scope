revised_title: 'Investigation of the Causes of Change of Friction with Velocity'
semantic_tags:
  - Friction
  - Lubrication
  - Surface Finish
  - Sliding Velocity
  - Boundary Film
tldr: The authors investigated the causes of friction changes with sliding velocity, examining dry, boundary, and fluid film friction. They found that changes in friction with velocity can be attributed to three sources: properties of clean metal surfaces, partial destruction of boundary films, and fluid film effects. The study also explored the effects of surface finish and previous sliding on friction and velocity relationships.
