revised_title: Representation Theory of Infinite-Dimensional Group in Tensor Analysis
semantic_tags:
  - Group Representation Theory
  - Tensor Analysis
  - Infinite-Dimensional Group
  - New-Tensors
  - Strings
tldr: The authors explore the representation theory of an infinite-dimensional group in the context of tensor analysis, new-tensors, and strings. They demonstrate that the study of these concepts is equivalent to studying the representation theory of this group, and discuss various representations and their properties.
