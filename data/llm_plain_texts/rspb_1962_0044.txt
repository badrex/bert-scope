tldr: The authors conducted experiments to induce specific immunological tolerance in adult mice by using sublethal irradiation and injecting donor-type spleen cells in high dosage. They found that this method led to a state of specific unresponsiveness, which could be equated to immunological tolerance. This discovery has implications for understanding the immune system and potential applications in transplantation.
