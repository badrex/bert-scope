tldr: The author presents a comprehensive analysis of quadratic forms containing more than three indeterminates, focusing on their invariants and concomitants. The study classifies these forms into orders based on their primitive concomitants and provides a method for determining their generic characters. This work expands the understanding of higher-dimensional quadratic forms and their properties.
