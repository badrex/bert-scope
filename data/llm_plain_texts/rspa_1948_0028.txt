tldr: The authors conducted an experimental and theoretical investigation of diffusion in a two-phase alloy, specifically a copper-nickel alloy. They found that Fick's equation can be applied to this case, with a modification that accounts for the difference in copper concentration from its equilibrium value. The experimental results support Becker's theoretical treatment of diffusion in binary alloys.
