tldr: The author's experiments demonstrate that adrenocortical tissue can be successfully transplanted after being frozen and thawed, using a glycerol-based preservation method. This research expands upon previous work with ovarian tissue and offers potential for preserving and transplanting other endocrine tissues. The study focuses on rats, but the findings could have implications for human medicine as well.
