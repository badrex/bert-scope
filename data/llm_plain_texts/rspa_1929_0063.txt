tldr: The author investigates the effect of hydrogen penetration into metal cathodes and its impact on the tensile properties and resistance to repeated stresses. They find that hydrogen affects the elongation of mild steel but does not diminish its tensile strength or resistance to repeated stresses. Nickel-plating reduces the resistance to repeated stresses, while acid corrosion affects the surface and lowers the resistance to torsional stresses. The study provides insights into the behavior of metals under stress and the role of hydrogen in causing brittleness.
