tldr: Thomas Nelson Marsham was a prominent figure in the development of nuclear power generation in the UK. He played a major role in the successful commissioning of the first generation of gas-cooled reactors at Calder Hall and Chapelcross, and was a persuasive advocate for the more efficient advanced gas-cooled reactors. Marsham also made significant contributions to the development of fast-neutron fission reactors, which he saw as essential for long-term gains to the national economy from nuclear power. He served in various managerial roles in the UK Atomic Energy Authority and was elected to the Fellowship of the Royal Society and the Fellowship of Engineering.
