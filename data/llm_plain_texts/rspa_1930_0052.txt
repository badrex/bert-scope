tldr: This study investigates the oxidation of gaseous benzene, a hydrocarbon with a different structure than previously studied hydrocarbons. The oxidation is found to be a homogeneous reaction involving chains, similar to the oxidation of ethylene. The reaction rate is influenced by the concentration of benzene and the ratio of benzene to oxygen. The primary oxidation product gives rise to chains when reacting with more hydrocarbon but not as readily with oxygen. This suggests that the oxidation of a substance containing oxygen in its molecule, like methyl alcohol vapor, would be an interesting subject for further study.
