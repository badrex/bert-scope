tldr: The authors studied the regional geochemistry of an area containing uranium mineralization to understand the processes controlling uranium distribution and deposit formation. They found that uranium enrichment occurred in areas with basement disrupted by magmatism or deep faulting. The study's findings can help establish exploration targets and improve understanding of uranium mineralization in the region.
