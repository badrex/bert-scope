tldr: The author investigates the resistance at a superconducting-normal interface at absolute zero temperature. They develop a three-dimensional theory to explain the enhanced interface resistance observed when bismuth is added to the lead superconductor. The theory predicts a linear variation of resistance with bismuth content, but the calculated resistance is still higher than the experimental measurements.
