tldr: This study investigates the impact of acids, alkalis, and carbon dioxide on electrotonic currents in nerve fibers. The results show that acids and alkalis affect the anodic and cathodic currents differently, while carbon dioxide typically causes a decrease in anodic currents and an increase in cathodic currents. These findings contribute to the understanding of nerve function and the effects of external factors on it.
