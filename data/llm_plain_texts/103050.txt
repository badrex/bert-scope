tldr: This article provides a historical account of the dispute between Mr. Leibniz and Dr. Keill regarding the right of invention of the method of fluxions, also known as the differential method. It discusses the Commercium Epistolicum Collinii & aliorum, a collection of letters and papers that reveal the development of a general method of resolving finite equations into infinite ones and applying these equations to solve problems using the method of fluxions and moments. The article highlights the contributions of key mathematicians, including Isaac Newton, John Collins, and James Gregory, and sheds light on the controversy surrounding the invention of this crucial mathematical concept.
