tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the thermo-electric action of metals and liquids, focusing on the effects of temperature and chemical reactions on the electrical state of metals. They used copper plates and various liquids to observe the deflections and currents produced, finding that the speed of corrosion generally increased with heat. The results showed that the hot plate was often positive, while the cold plate was negative, and the plates were mostly not tarnished.
