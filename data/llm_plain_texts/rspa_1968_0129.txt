tldr: The authors describe the performance of an electron spectrometer used to study total electron scattering cross-section functions in simple molecules. They analyze the structure in the cross-section functions and attempt to identify compound states, contributing to the understanding of compound negative ion states and their role in atomic collision processes and charge transfer spectra.
