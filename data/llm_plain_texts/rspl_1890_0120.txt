tldr: The author examines the color vision of three patients with tobacco amblyopia, a type of vision impairment caused by excessive tobacco use. The patients were tested for their ability to distinguish colors, luminosity of different parts of the spectrum, and total sensation of light. The results showed that one patient had lost all perception of green and red in the central part of their eye, while the other two patients had monochromatic color vision, distinguishing colors only by their luminosity.
