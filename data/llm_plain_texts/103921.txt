  - Planetary science
  - Gravitational attraction
  - Spheroids
  - Density variations
  - Geometric calculations
tldr: 'The author, Alexis Clairaut, investigates the figure of planets that revolve around an axis, considering the density's variation from the center to the surface. He develops mathematical formulas to calculate the attraction of spheroids with varying densities and applies this theory to the Earth and other planets. This research helps to understand the shape and gravitational forces of celestial bodies.'
