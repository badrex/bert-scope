tldr: In 1704, John Lafage dissected a dropsical body of a 52-year-old woman who suffered from a large swelling in her abdomen. The dissection revealed a viscous dark humor, containing 18 gallons, and numerous vesicles. The right kidney was affected by a particular dropsy, and two polyps were found in the heart. This case study provides insight into the understanding of dropsy and its effects on the body during that time.
