tldr: This article investigates the hydrogen bonding interactions in the gas phase between oxirane and hydrogen fluoride using infrared and microwave spectroscopy. The authors identify the geometry and electric dipole moment of the hydrogen bonded heterodimer, providing insights into the molecular structure and properties of the dimer. The findings contribute to the understanding of hydrogen bonding interactions and the behavior of molecules in the gas phase.
