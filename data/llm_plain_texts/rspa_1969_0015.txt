tldr: This study investigates the effects of irradiation, thermoluminescence, and heat treatment on the thermal conductivity of MgO crystals doped with chromous ions. The research concludes that the ion produced by irradiation is responsible for strong excess phonon scattering, with both resonant and non-resonant components. The thermal conductivity at low temperatures provides a useful method for determining the concentration of impurities in MgO.
