semantic_tags:
  - Electron motion
  - Gas discharge
  - Electric force
  - Magnetic force
  - Kinetic theory of gases
tldr: This article investigates the motion of electrons in gases under the influence of electric and magnetic forces. The authors describe their experimental setup and findings, which support the kinetic theory of gases and provide insights into the behavior of electrons in different gas environments. They also discuss the effects of water vapor and impurities on electron motion.
