tldr: The authors study the motion of a vortex filament with axial flow, focusing on long helical waves. They develop a method to obtain results for vortices of non-uniform structure and for displacements that are not necessarily small compared to the core radius. A general equation for the motion of a vortex filament is derived, valid for arbitrary shape and internal structure, and in the presence of an external irrotational velocity field.
