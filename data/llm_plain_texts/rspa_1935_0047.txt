tldr: The authors investigated the spectrum of selenium and focused on the structure of the singly ionized atom (Se II). They classified over 200 lines, which make up the quartet and doublet systems characteristic of Se II. The study provides insights into the atomic structure and spectral analysis of selenium, contributing to the understanding of its properties and potential applications.
