tldr: This study compares the infrared spectra of carbon monoxide chemisorbed on various metal films, including copper, silver, gold, iron, cobalt, and nickel. The results show that the adsorption of carbon monoxide on noble metals like copper and gold is weak, while on transition metals like iron, cobalt, and nickel, the spectra are similar to those found with silica-supported metals. The study provides insights into the chemisorption process and the relations between frequency, surface potential, and heat of adsorption on these metals.
