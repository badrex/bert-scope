tldr: The author conducted experiments on animals to study the influence of the brain on heart action and the generation of animal heat. They found that the brain is not directly necessary for heart action, and that artificial respiration can keep the heart beating after the brain is removed. The author also questioned the widely held belief that animal heat is dependent on chemical changes in the blood during respiration.
