tldr: The author conducted experiments on the inheritance of paternal and maternal characters in sea urchin hybrids. They crossed two species, Echinus esculentus and Echinocardium cordatum, and found that the hybrid larvae exhibited purely maternal characters, regardless of the male parent. This study provides insights into the mechanisms of heredity and hybridization in sea urchins.
