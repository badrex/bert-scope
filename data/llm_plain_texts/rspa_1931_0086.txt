tldr: The authors conducted experiments with a molecular beam of organic substances to study the exchange of energy between organic molecules and metallic surfaces. They found that the energy transfer from the metal surface to the organic molecules' internal degrees of freedom is significant. The experiments provide insights into the chemical decomposition of large molecules and the role of adsorption in collisions with heated metal surfaces.
