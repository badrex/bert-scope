tldr: The authors conducted a detailed study of the conditions under which water drops of varying radii coalesce or rebound at a clean air-water interface. They established relations between the drop radius, impact velocity, and angle of impact, and determined the critical values for coalescence between uncharged drops and plane or convex water surfaces. The study also explored the behavior of charged and polarized drops, finding that they coalesce more readily than uncharged drops.
