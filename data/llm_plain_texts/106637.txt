tldr: The author presents a new method for finding fluents by continuation, which involves resolving the given fluxion into a series of fluxions with decreasing or increasing indices. This method not only simplifies the process of continuing fluents but also offers a straightforward way to investigate the fluent of the given fluxion without continuation. The author demonstrates the utility of this method in various examples and hopes that it will contribute to the investigation of fluents in different cases.
