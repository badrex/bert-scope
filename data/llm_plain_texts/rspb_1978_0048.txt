tldr: The authors discovered that peripheral stimulation of turtle cones can evoke spikes through a feed-back synaptic mechanism involving a regenerative calcium conductance in the cone membrane. They found that spikes could be consistently observed under conditions that increase the membrane current through calcium channels, and that depolarization of the L-horizontal cells by pharmacological means suppressed the feed-back spikes. This suggests that the feed-back spikes result from the activation of a regenerative calcium conductance via a synaptic mechanism.
