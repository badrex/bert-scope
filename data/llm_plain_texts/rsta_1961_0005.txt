tldr: This article presents an approximate method for calculating the average behavior of two-valued response regulators in adiabatic calorimeters. The method is based on the concept of 'uniform operation' and uses an approximate description of the thermal conduction process. The analysis is applied to different types of adiabatic calorimeters and discusses the effects of time delay and auxiliary signals on the regulators' performance.
