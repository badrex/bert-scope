tldr: The author, John Tyndall, conducted experiments to study the blue color of the sky and the polarization of skylight. He discovered that a blue cloud, invisible in daylight, could be seen when illuminated by a powerful beam of light. This blue cloud exhibited polarized light, with the direction of maximum polarization being at right angles to the illuminating beam. The author also found that as the cloud texture became coarser, the polarization deteriorated, and the light discharged from the cloud changed from blue to white.
