tldr: The authors present a method for correcting wind tunnel measurements of lift and drag for aerofoils tested in a circular open jet tunnel with a reflexion plate. They develop a conformal transformation to account for the induced downwash effect on the aerofoil, which is essential for accurate wind tunnel testing of large-scale models.
