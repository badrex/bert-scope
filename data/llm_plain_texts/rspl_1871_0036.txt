tldr: The author conducted a series of experiments to test the theory of spontaneous generation, which suggests that life can arise from non-living matter. They used a refined experimental design to create a controlled environment free of living organisms and tested various solutions, including sodium phosphate and ammonia tartrate. The results showed no evidence of life emerging from these solutions, challenging the theory of spontaneous generation.
