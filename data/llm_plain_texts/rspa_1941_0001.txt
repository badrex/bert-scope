tldr: The authors investigated the equilibrium diagram of the silver-zinc system through various experimental methods, including thermal, microscopic, and X-ray techniques. They established that the depression of the freezing point of silver by zinc is slightly greater than that produced by an equal atomic percentage of indium. The study also found that the solidus and liquidus curves for the -phase do not coincide at 50 atomic% of zinc, and the freezing range of the equiatomic alloy is approximately 3Â°C. This research provides a detailed understanding of the silver-zinc system and its importance in material science and metallurgy.
