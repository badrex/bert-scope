tldr: The article discusses the development of effective insecticide control methods for locust hoppers, specifically using dieldrin. Dieldrin satisfies the requirements of being a stomach poison, persistent, cumulative, and safe for users and consumers. The Sayer exhaust sprayer and aircraft spraying methods are explored as efficient ways to distribute the insecticide. The use of dieldrin in locust hopper control has been exaggerated by propaganda, and a value judgement should be made considering the benefits and risks.
