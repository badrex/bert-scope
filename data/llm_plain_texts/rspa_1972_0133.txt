tldr: The authors studied the interaction between active nitrogen and carbon monoxide, discovering that adding small amounts of CO to active nitrogen induces strong emission of the CO fourth positive bands. They found that the energy transfer from singlet states of nitrogen to CO is an efficient process, and the excited triplet states of nitrogen contribute to the emission of triplet states of CO but not significantly to singlet CO emission.
