tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the flexor reflex and found that different afferent paths converge on the same motoneuron. They discovered the central excitatory state (CES) and its persistence, which allows for the summation of CES produced by individual centripetal impulses. They also studied the refractory period following a reflex discharge and the effects of antidromic volleys on CES and motoneurons.
