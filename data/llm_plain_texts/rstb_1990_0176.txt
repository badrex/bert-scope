  - Root:Shoot Ratio
tldr: The authors develop a mathematical model to understand the soil-atmosphere-crop relation and its impact on soil productivity and environmental pollution. They explore the relationship between crop growth, temperature, and light, and how the root:shoot ratio changes during a crop's growth. The model also considers the role of fertilizers and the growth of grains and tubers on the plant.
