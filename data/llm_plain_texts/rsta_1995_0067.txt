tldr: The article discusses the impact of polar processes on middle latitude ozone loss and the role of the Arctic polar vortex. Recent studies suggest that air, recently activated and torn from the edge of the polar vortex, contributes to the observed ozone decrease. Observational and modeling studies indicate that there is an important role for filaments of vortex air being stripped away from the vortex edge. The degree of mixing between the polar vortex and lower latitudes is crucial in understanding the chemical structure of the middle latitude lower stratosphere and its implications for climate change.
