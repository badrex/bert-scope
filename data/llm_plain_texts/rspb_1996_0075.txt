tldr: This study investigates the genetic variation and mobility of two Australian flying-fox species, Pteropus alecto and Pteropus poliocephalus. The researchers found high gene flow between populations, with an estimated exchange of 15 and 28 individuals per generation for P. alecto and P. poliocephalus, respectively. The low Wright's FST values indicate that these flying-foxes are essentially panmictic and should be treated as migratory species for management purposes.
