revised_title: 'The Synthetic Action of Acids and Enzymes: Synthesis of Maltose and Isomaltose'

tldr: The author investigates the synthetic action of acids and enzymes, specifically focusing on the synthesis of maltose and isomaltose from glucose. They discovered that both enzymes and acids can act as hydrolytic and condensing agents, but enzymes exhibit a more selective activity. The study provides insights into the behavior of glucose in solution and the role of enzymes in the formation of biose compounds.
