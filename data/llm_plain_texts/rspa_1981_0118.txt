tldr: The article presents a study on the growth of soot particles during the pyrolysis and partial oxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons. The authors develop two particle growth models, COAG and CONCO, based on various assumptions about condensation and nucleation. These models help predict the observed rates of increase in scattered-light intensity and provide insights into soot formation processes. The study demonstrates the validity of postulates related to the absorption and emission of gas-phase polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, which are intermediates in the soot formation process.
