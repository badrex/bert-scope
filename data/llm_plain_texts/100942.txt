tldr: This article describes two observations of stones found in a dog's bladder and a horse's backbone. The dog's stone was white with some reddish specks, and the horse's stone was olive-colored with red specks. The author notes that animals seem to know which herbs are beneficial for their health without any guidance from human experts. The dog's bladder also contained small white gravel, and the horse's stone was still warm 12 hours after the horse's death.
