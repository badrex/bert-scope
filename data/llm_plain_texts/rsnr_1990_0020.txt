tldr: During World War I, E.A. Milne, an astrophysicist and mathematician, joined a group of talented scientists called "Hill's Brigands" to develop air defense strategies. They tackled problems like measuring the height of invisible aircraft, improving fuses and guns, and creating new firing tables. Their work laid the foundation for modern anti-aircraft gunnery and had a significant impact on Milne's career.
