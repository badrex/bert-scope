tldr: The author proposes a new mechanism for sympatric speciation driven by beneficial mutations with habitat-specific effects. These mutations can lead to the evolution of habitat races, which are genetically isolated populations using different habitats. The study suggests that the conditions for sympatric speciation are less stringent than previously thought, as habitat-specific genetic variation in fitness can be maintained through beneficial mutations.
