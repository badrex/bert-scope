tldr: The authors studied the morphology of melt-crystallized polyethylene and discovered three main types of lamellar profiles in spherulites. These profiles include ridged sheets, planar sheets, and S-shaped sheets. The research helps classify the textures of melt-crystallized polyethylene and provides insights into the crystallography and growth conditions of polyethylene lamellae.
