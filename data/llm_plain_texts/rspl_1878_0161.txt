tldr: This article discusses the effects of the descent of the diaphragm on abdominal circulation and the role of respiratory forces in the human body. The author explains how the pressure created by the diaphragm affects the blood flow in the veins and arteries, and how this pressure balances the suction-action of the chest during inspiration. The author also explores the impact of various body movements on abdominal circulation and the movement of fluids in the abdomen.
