tldr: This study examines the stability of an electrically conducting gas rotating in the presence of a toroidal magnetic field and its own gravitational field. The research explores the effects of differential rotation and meridional gradients of the magnetic field on the system's instability. The authors discuss the impact of various factors, such as the strength of the magnetic field, the electrical conductivity of the fluid, and the thermal stratification of the gas, on the instability of the system.
