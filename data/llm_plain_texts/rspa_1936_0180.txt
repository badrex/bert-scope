tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the absorption of light in caesium vapour in the presence of various foreign gases. They found that these gases significantly reduced the absorption at all wavelengths, and the extent of reduction varied with the type of gas. The results provided insights into the interactions between caesium vapour and different gases, which could be useful for understanding the underlying mechanisms in spectroscopy and quantum mechanics.
