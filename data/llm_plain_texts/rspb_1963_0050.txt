tldr: This study investigates the production and induction of penicillinase by a strain of Staphylococcus aureus. The authors found that methicillin is more effective in inducing penicillinase formation due to its greater stability against the enzyme. They also describe a method for preparing cell-free penicillinase and discuss the significance of the Michaelis constants for various penicillins in relation to their effectiveness against penicillinase-producing staphylococci.
