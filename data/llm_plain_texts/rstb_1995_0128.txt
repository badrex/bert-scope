tldr: The article describes the embryonic development of the locust thoracic ganglia and the growth of a group of spiking local interneurons. The development is divided into three phases: initial slow growth, a period of extensive branch growth, and a maturation phase where branches are pruned away. The study shows that the organizational groundplan of these interneurons is established early in development without extensive growth into incorrect regions of neuropil. The findings provide insight into the early development of the insect central nervous system and the mechanisms shaping its structure and function.
