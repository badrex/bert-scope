tldr: The author presents a method for accurately measuring longitude using a theodolite fitted with a shutter eyepiece. This device allows for precise observations of star positions, overcoming issues with estimation and star motion. By comparing the observed time with rhythmic time signals, the Global Standard Time of a star's appearance can be determined, leading to more accurate longitude calculations.
