tldr: The authors studied the equilibria in the halogenation of organic substances in aqueous solutions, focusing on iodination and bromination reactions. They used measurements of redox potentials to determine the equilibrium concentrations of halogens and organic radicals. The results provide insights into bond strengths and can be used to derive information about the thermodynamics of halogenation reactions in solution.
