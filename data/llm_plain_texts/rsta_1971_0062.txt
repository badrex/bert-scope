tldr: This article discusses the manifold structure of the chromosphere and corona, focusing on solar studies and space observations. It explores the relationship between the solar magnetic field and the structure of the chromosphere, as well as the connection between coronal structures and magnetic fields. The authors also examine the role of spicules in chromospheric heating and the stability of chromospheric structures.
