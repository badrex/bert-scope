tldr: The author investigates the evolution of isotropic radiation from directionally dependent source distributions in multi-dimensional, dispersive media. They approach the radiation problem using a convolution principle and analyze the behavior of the radiation field, eventually leading to a purely pulsatory steady state. The study includes applications to vibrating elastic plates and internal gravity waves in Boussinesq fluids.
