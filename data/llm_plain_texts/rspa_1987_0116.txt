tldr: This article presents an analytical and numerical study of converging shock waves, focusing on the behavior of polygonal shock shapes. The authors develop an approximate theory of shock dynamics to analyze converging cylindrical shocks and find that regular polygonal shapes are stable, with the Mach number increasing according to the same formula as for a circular cylindrical shock. The study also explores the behavior of perturbed circular shapes and provides further analytical results for rectangular shapes.
