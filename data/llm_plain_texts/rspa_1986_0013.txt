tldr: The authors study the field-induced hot-electron emission from metal-insulator microstructures on broad-area high-voltage electrodes. They develop a detailed theoretical model based on the formation of conducting channels in a metal-insulator-vacuum (m.i.v.) micro-emission regime. This model provides experimentally verified quantitative relations for the current-voltage characteristic, spectral shape, and the field-dependence of the spectral full width at half maximum and shift. The study contributes to understanding the physical nature of these sub-sites and their emission characteristics.
