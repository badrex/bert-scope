tldr: 'The study investigates the growth and cell replacement in the new-born pig intestine, focusing on the changes in cell populations during the first 2 days of post-natal life. The research shows that crypt cells, formed before birth, never become vacuolated, and the main change in cell populations involves cells produced by mitosis. The findings provide insights into understanding how cellular replacement relates to changing intestinal function.'
