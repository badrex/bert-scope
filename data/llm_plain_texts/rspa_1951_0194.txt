tldr: The authors describe a method for determining the integral flash latent heat of a binary mixture at constant pressure using the ethylene-carbon dioxide system. They compare their experimental results with those calculated from the Duhem-Margules equation and discuss the limitations of the method. The study provides insights into the thermodynamics of binary mixtures and their applications in various industries.
