tldr: The authors present a detailed analysis of the Debye-Huckel theory of strong electrolytes, focusing on the effects of concentration on ionic interactions. They propose a new approach using a more general force law and the Gibbs phase-integral to extend the theory to stronger concentrations. The study aims to improve the understanding of electrolyte behavior and its applications in various fields.
