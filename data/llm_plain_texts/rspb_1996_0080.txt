tldr: Researchers trained hippocampal ablated and intact pigeons to find a reward in an outdoor arena with both sun compass information and color landmark beacons. Intact pigeons learned to rely on the sun compass while ignoring color beacons, while hippocampal ablated pigeons learned to use color beacons and ignored the sun compass. This study shows that the hippocampal formation is crucial for learning spatial navigation strategies in pigeons.
