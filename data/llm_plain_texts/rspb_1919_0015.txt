tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the periodic variations of conductance in the palm of the human hand and its relation to emotive phenomena. They observed a diurnal periodicity in conductance values, which was higher during the night and lower during the day. The author concluded that the emotive response is closely associated with nutrition and can be considered a type of trophic phenomenon.
