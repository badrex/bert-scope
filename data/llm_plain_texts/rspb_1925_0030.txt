tldr: The author investigates the conduction of excitation in the leaves of Mimosa Spegazzinii, finding that it does not depend on the transpiration current. The study shows that excitation is conducted up and down the leaf much faster than the water current, suggesting that the conduction is not related to the movement of a stimulating substance with the water. This research contributes to the understanding of plant communication and response mechanisms.
