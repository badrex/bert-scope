tldr: The author presents a method to measure the specific heat of a gas at constant volume using two spheres and a calorimeter. The experiments were conducted on air, and the results showed that the specific heat at constant volume is independent of pressure. The author also discusses the limitations of the method and plans to continue the experiments with other gases and lower pressures.
