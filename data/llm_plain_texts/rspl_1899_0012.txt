tldr: The authors describe the development of a quartz-thread gravity balance, an instrument used to measure small differences in gravity. They discuss the design, construction, and improvements made to the instrument during various journeys, and provide details on its accuracy and limitations. This instrument allowed for more precise measurements of gravity, contributing to the understanding of Earth's geophysics.
