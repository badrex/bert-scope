tldr: The author investigates the lift and moment on a flat plate in a stream of finite width, using a method of conformal transformation. The study considers an elliptic cylinder and its boundary conditions, providing expansions for lift and moment suitable for any position of the plate. The findings can be applied to understand the forces acting on a flat plate in various fluid dynamics scenarios.
