tldr: The author investigates the distribution and extraction of scandium from various minerals, including zirconium, beryls, titanates, columbites, and titanocolumbites. They also study the chemical properties of scandium, such as its iodate and sulfate compounds, and discuss the behavior of scandium in the presence of acids. The author concludes that scandium is widely distributed in the earth and has potential for further research and extraction.
