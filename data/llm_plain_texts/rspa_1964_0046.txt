tldr: The authors present a study on the inductive effects of substituent groups on the π-electrons of aromatic hydrocarbons using electronic spectroscopic data. They compare two methods to estimate the inductive effect and discuss its relationship to the electron spin resonance spectra of aromatic hydrocarbon ions.
