tldr: The study investigates the sensitivity of the sea anemone Metridium senile to light and its adaptation process. The author found that the sea anemone responds to illumination by contracting its longitudinal musculature, particularly the parietal system. The action spectra of white individuals show a maximum sensitivity at around 490-520 nm. The study also discusses the possible presence of two distinct photosensitive systems and how pigments in red and brown varieties act as filters, not as photosensitive substances. The findings provide insights into the photoreceptive system of sea anemones and their differences from vertebrate animals.
