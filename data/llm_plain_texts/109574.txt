tldr: This article describes the measurement of an arc of the meridian from Dunnose in the Isle of Wight to Clifton in Yorkshire, as part of the trigonometrical survey of England conducted between 1800 and 1802. The author, William Mudge, discusses the reasons for choosing the locations, the instruments used, and the calculations involved. The results show that the length of a degree on the meridian in latitude 52Â° 2' 20" is approximately 60,820 fathoms. The author also compares his findings with those of French astronomers who measured the arc of the meridian between Paris and Barcelona.
