tldr: 'The author, Rev. A. E. Eaton, describes the zoological collections made during the Transit of Venus Expeditions in 1874-75. He discusses the Neuroptera species found in Kerguelen's Land and Rodriguez, including the fly named H. amphibius, which spends a large portion of its life underwater. Eaton also mentions the uncertainty of the habitat of a Psocidce species, which may have accompanied the American Transit of Venus Expedition from Washington.'
