tldr: In this article, Michael Faraday investigates the nature of induction and the specific inductive capacity of different materials. He conducts experiments to determine if induction occurs in curved lines and finds that it does. Faraday also explores the inductive capacity of various dielectrics, including air, shell-lac, and other substances, and discovers that each material has a unique inductive capacity. This research challenges the existing theories of induction and contributes to the understanding of the fundamental principles of electromagnetism.
