tldr: The authors apply Van der Waals' equation to osmotic pressures of various aqueous solutions, including cane sugar, dextrose, galactose, and mannite. They find that the equation can represent the relationship between pressures, volumes, and temperatures of these solutions. However, the equation holds only over a limited range of values, and further experimental work is needed to refine the results.
