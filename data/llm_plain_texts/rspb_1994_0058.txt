tldr: The author examines the widely-accepted model of the evolution of functionally novel proteins after gene duplication, known as the mdn model. Contradicting this hypothesis, the author presents evidence from various sources, including the study of duplicate genes in the tetraploid frog Xenopus laevis, and the role of positive Darwinian selection in functional divergence within multi-gene families. The author then proposes an alternative model for the evolution of functionally novel proteins, which is consistent with current knowledge in molecular biology.
