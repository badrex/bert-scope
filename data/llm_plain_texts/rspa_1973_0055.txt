tldr: The authors measured the photoelectron spectra of thiocarbonyl fluoride and thiocarbonyl chloride, identifying ionization potentials and assigning molecular orbitals associated with lone pair electrons, C=S π orbitals, and σ-bonding electrons. They compared their findings with other related molecules, such as thioformaldehyde, carbonyl fluoride, and carbonyl chloride, and discussed the changes in geometry upon ionization.
