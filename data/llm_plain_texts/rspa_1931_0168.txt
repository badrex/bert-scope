tldr: This study investigates the deformation and breaking of water drops in strong electric fields, which is crucial for understanding phenomena in thunderstorms. The researchers found that water drops become unstable and form filaments when exposed to a certain field strength. The behavior of drops in vertical and horizontal fields, as well as the effect of reduced air pressure, was studied. The findings have implications for understanding the ionization and electrical discharges in thunderstorms.
