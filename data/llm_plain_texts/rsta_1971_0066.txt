tldr: The authors analyze time profiles of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and X-ray emissions during solar flares, concluding that soft X-ray emission is predominantly produced by thermal processes. They suggest a model in which cool plasma from low in the chromosphere passes through a region of magnetic instability and is heated during the passage, explaining the observed time profiles of EUV and X-ray emissions.
