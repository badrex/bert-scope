tldr: This article investigates the dissipation of energy in tidal currents, specifically in the Irish Sea, and proposes a method to estimate the friction of the sea on the bottom. The author compares the friction of the sea to the friction of the wind on the ground and uses this similarity to calculate the energy dissipated by tidal friction. The results show that the energy dissipation is significantly higher than previous estimates, highlighting the importance of understanding tidal friction for predicting and managing coastal processes.
