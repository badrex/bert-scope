  - Crystal axes orientation
  - Material distortion
tldr: This study investigates the distortion of aluminium crystals under compression, focusing on the distortion caused by double slipping and changes in the orientation of crystal axes. The author discusses the results' implications for the structure of rolled metals and compares different types of double slipping to determine the most likely to occur.
