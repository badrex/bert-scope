tldr: The authors demonstrate that catalase in erythrocytes protects haemoglobin from being oxidized to choleglobin. They also show that the stroma of erythrocytes contains a protective factor that influences the rate of choleglobin formation. Acid destromatization affects catalase activity by decreasing it and increasing the rate of inactivation of the remaining catalase by ascorbic acid.
