tldr: This article presents experiments on the solid densities of oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen at low temperatures. The author measures the volumes of gases that are liquefied and solidified under controlled cooling conditions. The results provide insights into the critical densities and molecular volumes of these substances at various temperatures, contributing to the understanding of physical constants at low temperatures.
