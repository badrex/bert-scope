tldr: The authors investigate potassium ferrioxalate as a potential standard chemical actinometer for use in photochemical investigations and other purposes. They compare its quantum efficiency with uranyl oxalate and find that potassium ferrioxalate provides a valuable new chemical actinometer, recommended for use in place of uranyl oxalate for many purposes. The study includes detailed working instructions for using the actinometer.
