tldr: This article explores the magneto-optic phenomena in iron, nickel, and cobalt, developing a theory to explain magnetic reflection and transmission through magnetized films. The author compares the theory with experimental results, finding good agreement. The study also investigates the Hall effect and its role in the magneto-optic phenomena.
