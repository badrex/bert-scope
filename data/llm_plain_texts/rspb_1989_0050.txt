tldr: The authors present a new model, the -model, for the assembly of ionic currents in a thalamic neuron. They demonstrate how the stability and state diagrams can be used to explain various firing patterns of thalamic and other neurons. The -model provides a better description of the double ramp response and is in agreement with the interpretation of the burst response mechanisms discussed by Jahnsen and Llinas.
