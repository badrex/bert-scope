tldr: The study investigates the formation of vesicles and hormone transformation in the distal part of a neurosecretory system in Squilla mantis. Using electron microscopy, the researchers found organelles with interconnected tubules that accumulate secretory material in the preterminal portions of neurosecretory fibers. These findings support the hypothesis that secretory material assembles within mitochondria or their derivatives in the preterminal portions of neurosecretory fibers, and that the distal part of a neurosecretory system plays an active role in hormone transformation or assemblage.
