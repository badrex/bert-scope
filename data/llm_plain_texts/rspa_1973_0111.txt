tldr: This article presents a thermodynamic approach to characterizing eutectic structures in binary alloys. The authors propose a classification scheme based on the entropy of solution and the relative volume of each phase, which helps predict eutectic growth and microstructure. The study covers 26 eutectic alloys, and the findings can be used to predict the structure of eutectic alloys at different growth rates, making it useful for structure-control applications.
