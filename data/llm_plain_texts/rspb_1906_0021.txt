tldr: The authors investigate the cytology of malignant growths, specifically carcinomata, and identify a unique type of nuclear division, heterotype mitosis, occurring in cancerous tissues. They observe early stages of cancer development and find that cancer cells directly alter and invade healthy tissue, suggesting a primary transmutation of normal cells into cancerous cells.
