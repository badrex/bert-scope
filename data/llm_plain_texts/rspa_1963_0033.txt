tldr: This study examines the effects of low doses of sulfur mustard on deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and its physical properties. The research shows that alkylation causes chain breakage and a decrease in molecular weight, with the rate of breakage being proportional to the extent of alkylation. The findings have implications for understanding DNA damage and the development of chemotherapy treatments.
