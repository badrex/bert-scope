tldr: The study investigates the reducing power of Bact. Lactis Aerogenes under various conditions, such as transitions from anaerobic to aerobic conditions and vice versa. Two types of adjustments are observed: rapid changes in active intermediates' concentrations and slow adaptive modifications of enzyme systems in response to the cell's needs. The research focuses on the development of extra reducing power when the cell uses nitrate as a source of nitrogen and when nitrate is reduced in the presence of oxygen.
