tldr: The article discusses the electronic structure and bonding of high-temperature superconductors, specifically focusing on cuprate materials. It explores the concept of doped Mott insulators and how the addition of holes to the planes in these materials leads to the formation of spin singlet states. The author also explains the reduction of the complex electronic system to a one-band model and its comparison with various experiments.
