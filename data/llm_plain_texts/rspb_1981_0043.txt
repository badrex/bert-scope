tldr: This study investigates the relationship between the insect-pathogenic nematode Neoaplectana carpocapsae and its symbiotic bacterium Xenorhabdus nematophilus. The authors found that the nematodes help the bacteria by excreting an immune inhibitor that selectively destroys certain immune proteins in the insect host, allowing the nematodes and bacteria to survive against the insect's immune system. This research contributes to understanding the mutualistic relationship between nematodes and their bacteria and its survival value against induced insect immunity.
