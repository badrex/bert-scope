tldr: 'William Michael Herbert Greaves was a distinguished British astronomer who made significant contributions to various fields of astronomy, including celestial mechanics, radio astronomy, and stellar spectroscopy. He worked at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, where he collaborated with C. R. Davidson and E. Martin on determining effective stellar temperatures and studying the effects of interstellar dust and gas on star colors. Greaves also analyzed proper motions and radial velocities of stars, and was an early advocate for radio astronomy.'
