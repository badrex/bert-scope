tldr: The authors investigate the Becquerel effect in the presence of dyestuffs and the action of light on dyes. They find that the dye may be either oxidized or reduced when illuminated, and the mechanisms of these reactions are different and can proceed independently. The study provides a logical explanation for all the photoelectric effects observed with dyestuffs and has implications for the fading of dyes and photo-sensitized tendering of textiles.
