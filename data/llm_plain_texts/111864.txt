tldr: The Stereotrope is an optical instrument that combines the principles of the stereoscope and thaumatropes to create a 3D motion experience. It uses persistence of vision to display eight stereoscopic pictures of an object in motion, giving the appearance of solid relief and real-life motion. The Stereotrope offers a new way to visualize and experience 3D motion, with potential applications in entertainment and education.
