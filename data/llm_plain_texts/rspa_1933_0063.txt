tldr: This article discusses the change of resistance in a semi-conductor when exposed to a magnetic field. The author explains the importance of considering the Fermi-Dirac statistics and the influence of the Hall effect in understanding the behavior of electrons in a metal. The study focuses on semi-conductors like germanium, tellurium, and molecular graphite, which are more amenable to mathematical treatment. The author concludes that the theory of resistance change in semi-conductors gives the correct form of the curve and the right order of magnitude for the resistance change, although the numerical values are lower than those found by other methods.
