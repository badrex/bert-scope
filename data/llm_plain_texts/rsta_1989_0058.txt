tldr: This article discusses the line plant for future local networks, focusing on optical solutions that use single-mode fiber. It explores various technical solutions to challenges such as low-loss components, bidirectional working, and keeping costs low for passive optical networks. The authors present an on-site demonstrator and examine critical components and issues to produce an overall expected power budget for the system.
