tldr: The authors study bifurcation problems on the hexagonal lattice in the context of the planar Benard problem, which deals with fluid convection and pattern formation. They use singularity theory and group theory to classify and analyze the bifurcation problems, finding stable roll and hexagon patterns, as well as other complex equilibrium solutions. The results have implications for understanding fluid dynamics, crystallography, and visual hallucination patterns.
