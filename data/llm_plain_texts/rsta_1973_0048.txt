tldr: The authors developed new vertical and horizontal quartz fiber accelerometers for measuring changes in Earth strain. These accelerometers are small, sensitive, and have strict control of internal temperature and pressure. They can detect teleseismic signals with a surface wave magnitude of 2.5 at a distance of 190 km and provide valuable data for studying earthquakes, tides, and other Earth movements.
