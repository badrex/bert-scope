tldr: The author discusses the structure of plant cell walls, comparing them to mucilage secretions and suggesting that they may be composed of a substance that transitions between mucilage and cellulose. They also present findings on the spectrum of the corona, using photographs taken during solar eclipses to differentiate between chromospheric and coronal phenomena.
