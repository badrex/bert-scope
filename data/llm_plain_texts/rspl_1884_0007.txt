tldr: The author conducted experiments to measure the electromotive force resulting from the difference in potential between saltwater and freshwater in tidal streams. They found that the difference in potential can cause a current to flow, and the resulting electromotive force can be used to study the behavior of various metals in different solutions. The research provides practical insights into the effects of tidal action on rivers and estuaries.
