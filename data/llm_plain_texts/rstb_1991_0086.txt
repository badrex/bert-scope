tldr: The authors explore methods to determine the indigeneity of amino acids in fossils using stable carbon and nitrogen isotope compositions of individual d- and L-enantiomers. They found that comparing the isotopic compositions of amino acids in fossils can help establish their authenticity, providing insights into the origin and preservation of ancient organic matter.
