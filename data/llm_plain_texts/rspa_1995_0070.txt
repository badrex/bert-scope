tldr: The author presents a unified formulation for plasticity models of granular materials, including the double sliding, free rotating model, the double shearing model, and the plastic potential model. The study demonstrates the relationship between these models and shows that they can be derived from a general kinematic rule, making them consistent with the continuum theory of constitutive equations.
