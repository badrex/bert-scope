semantic_tags:
  - Peptide hormones
  - Gastrin
  - Hormone structure
  - Hormone synthesis
  - Amino acid analysis
tldr: The authors conducted chemical studies on mammalian gastrins, focusing on their structures and synthesis. They discovered differences in the structures of gastrins from various species, such as human, porcine, ovine, and bovine. The authors also developed methods for synthesizing these hormones and confirmed their structures using fingerprinting techniques.
