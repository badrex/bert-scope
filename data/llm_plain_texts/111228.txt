tldr: M. Kamtz shares his findings on terrestrial magnetism, discussing the differences in horizontal and vertical force constants and the challenges of using older observations. He compares his calculations with various observers' data and suggests that more accurate observations are needed for better understanding. Kamtz also expresses his desire to publish his work but faces challenges due to political circumstances and language barriers.
