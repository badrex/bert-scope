tldr: This article examines the theories of adaptive sex ratio in outerossed vertebrates, specifically discussing the physiological theory by Trivers & Willard and the demographic theory by Verner. The author argues that evidence from vertebrates is unfavorable to both theories and supports a non-adaptive model, the purely random (Mendelian) determination of sex. The article also explores the implications of these findings on parental investment and offspring sex ratio in various vertebrate species.
