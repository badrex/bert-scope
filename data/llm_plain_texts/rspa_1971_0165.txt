tldr: The authors conducted experiments in a shock tube to study vibrational-rotational energy exchange in hydrogen mixtures. They measured relaxation times and found that both rotational-vibrational and translational-vibrational energy transfer are important. The results show that para-hydrogen is not an order of magnitude less efficient than ortho-hydrogen in deactivating the bending vibration, contrary to previous theoretical calculations.
