tldr: The article discusses the structure, activity, and evolution of phosphoglycerate kinase, an enzyme that plays a crucial role in glycolysis. The enzyme's molecular structure is conserved, with two separated domains that bind substrates and facilitate the high-energy phosphoryl transfer reaction. The author also explores the enzyme's catalytic mechanism, its interactions with substrates and anions, and its importance in various organisms.
