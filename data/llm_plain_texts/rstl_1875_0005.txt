tldr: The author calculates the annual contraction of the Earth's nucleus due to its refrigeration, estimating the thickness of the solid shell required to support volcanic activity. The study assumes the heat dissipated from the Earth's nucleus is derived from the center and transmitted through the shell. The author also considers the nature of the Earth's interior, including the density and specific heat of its nucleus.
