tldr: 'The authors studied the cells of the islets of Langerhans and found that their secretory activity is associated with changes in the form and size of the Golgi apparatus. They observed that during pregnancy and after exposure to heat, the islet cells show more uniform activity and distinct morphological changes. The authors suggest that the secretory products are formed within the Golgi apparatus and then discharged into the cytoplasm of the cell.'
