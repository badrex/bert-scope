tldr: The authors studied the magnetic and thermal properties of dysprosium ethyl sulfate, a salt with highly anisotropic magnetic ions. They found that the magnetic dipole-dipole coupling between the ions is unusually large, and the system behaves like an Ising model. The authors measured the specific heat and entropy of the salt using three different methods and found good agreement between them. Their work provides a better understanding of the magnetic and thermal properties of this unique salt.
