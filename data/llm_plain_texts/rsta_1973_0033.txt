tldr: Researchers used solid-electrolyte sensors to measure the oxygen and sulfur fugacities of magmatic gases in Mount Etna's active vents. The measurements showed that the gases had higher oxygen fugacities than those in Hawaii's Makaopuhi lava lake. The study provides insights into the behavior of gases in volcanic vents and helps understand the eruption dynamics of Mount Etna.
