semantic_tags:
  - Atmospheric diffusion
  - Diffusion equations
  - Distance-neighbour graph
  - Fluid dynamics
  - Turbulence
tldr: The author presents a method to comprehend atmospheric diffusion using a distance-neighbour graph. They discuss the challenges of other methods and propose a new approach, which can be applied to various circumstances. The graph provides a good impression of the size of the cluster and helps estimate the diffusion coefficient.
