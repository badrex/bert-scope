tldr: The authors conducted an X-ray investigation of a long-chain hydrocarbon crystal structure. They determined the crystal's unit cell size and found that it had 29 carbon atoms. The study focused on understanding the intensity distribution among the spots observed on the X-ray photographs, which provided insights into the crystal's structure and properties.
