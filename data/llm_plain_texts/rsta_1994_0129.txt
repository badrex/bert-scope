tldr: This article summarizes the knowledge of the intrinsic magnetic fields of the planets Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, as discovered by various space missions. It discusses the generation of these magnetic fields through dynamo processes within the planets' cores and the unique characteristics of each planet's magnetosphere due to their global fields. The article also highlights the challenges and future prospects for understanding these magnetic fields and their interactions with the solar wind.
