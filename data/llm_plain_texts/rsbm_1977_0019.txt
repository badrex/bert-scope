tldr: This biographical memoir recounts the life and scientific career of Robert Spence, a prominent chemist known for his work in physical-organic chemistry, oxidation reactions, and contributions to World War II efforts. Spence's research focused on the production and constitution of polynuclear compounds, and he later worked on vapor phase oxidation of organic molecules. During the war, he served as a Chemical Warfare Adviser and developed new methods for smoke and anti-malarial sprays. After the war, Spence joined the atomic research team in Montreal and contributed to the early development of nuclear energy.
