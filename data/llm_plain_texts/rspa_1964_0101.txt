tldr: The gaseous oxidation of acetone was studied at high temperatures, revealing two distinct oxidation regimes. The high-temperature reaction was found to be autocatalytic, involving degenerate chain branching with formaldehyde playing a significant role. The main products of the reaction were carbon monoxide, water, and methane, with minor amounts of other gases and peroxides.
