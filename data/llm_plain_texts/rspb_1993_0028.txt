tldr: The authors explain the replacement of red squirrels by grey squirrels in Britain due to feeding competition and the post-war decline in coppiced hazel. Grey squirrels have a strong competitive advantage over red squirrels in woods with oak trees, which provide acorn crops. The authors suggest that red squirrels can be preserved in mainland Britain by managing oak and hazel forests to maintain a balance between the two species.
