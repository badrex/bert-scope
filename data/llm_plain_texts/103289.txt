tldr: Antony van Leeuwenhoek examines the configuration of diamonds using a microscope and observes that the streaks or fibers in the diamonds are caused by the coagulation or augmentation of matter over time. He concludes that diamonds grow by the accession of new matter and compares their formation to the coagulation of many salts. Van Leeuwenhoek also discusses the possibility of finding small diamonds in the earth and the growth of larger diamonds over time.
