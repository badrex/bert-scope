tldr: The author, Frederick Skey, examines the microscopic structure of muscular fibers in animal and organic life. He finds that these fibers have an average diameter of one 400th of an inch and are made up of bands or fibrillae, which can be further divided into tubular filaments. These findings help distinguish between muscular and tendinous fibers and provide insight into the structure of heart fibers. Additionally, a related paper discusses the function of the medulla oblongata and medulla spinalis in the nervous system.
