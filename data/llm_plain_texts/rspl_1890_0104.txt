tldr: The authors describe a new test using salicyl-sulphonic acid to detect albumin and other proteids in various solutions. The test is sensitive and precise, even in dilute solutions, and can be used to identify minute amounts of proteids in samples. The test is particularly useful for detecting albumin in serum and white of egg solutions.
