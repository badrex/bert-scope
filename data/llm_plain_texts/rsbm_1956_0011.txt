tldr: 'George Hickling was a notable geologist who made significant contributions to the understanding of Upper Permian tracks, Old Red Sandstone, and coal mining in Lancashire. He created a contour map of a coal seam, which helped in identifying potential coal reserves and understanding the structure of the heavily faulted Lancashire Coal Field. His work laid the foundation for future studies on coal mining and geological mapping.'
