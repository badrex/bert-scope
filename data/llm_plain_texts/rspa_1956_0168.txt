tldr: The author discusses the phenomenon of addition polymerization and its importance in chemical kinetics. They explain the process of radical growth and the role of radicals in initiating polymerization. The author also highlights the use of radioactive tracers to study the fate of radicals and the introduction of new terminal groups to create block or non-random macromolecules.
