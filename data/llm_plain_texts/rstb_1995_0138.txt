tldr: 'This article discusses the complex network of signal transduction pathways controlling light-regulated development in Arabidopsis plants. It highlights the role of photoreceptors, such as phytochromes, in mediating light responses and the integration of various input signals to regulate plant development. The article also reviews recent genetic advances in understanding the mechanisms of light responses and the role of photoreceptor signaling intermediates.'
