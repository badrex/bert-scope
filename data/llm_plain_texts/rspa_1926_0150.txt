tldr: This article investigates the effect of temperature on the viscosity of air. The author compares their results with other researchers and addresses criticisms of their experimental method. They find that Sutherland's law holds approximately over limited temperature ranges, and discuss potential sources of error in their measurements. The article contributes to the understanding of air properties and fluid mechanics.
