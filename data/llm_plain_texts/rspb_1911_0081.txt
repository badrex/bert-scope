tldr: The authors investigated the refractive indices of the eye media in various Australian animals. They used an Abbe refractometer to measure the refractive indices of the aqueous humor, cornea, and lens. The results showed unique phenomena, such as the tendency towards a "negative eye" in some species, which is corrected by the lens's refractive index.
