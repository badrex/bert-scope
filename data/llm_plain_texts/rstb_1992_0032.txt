tldr: This study investigates the effects of forest disturbance on litterfall, leaf litter decomposition, and litter invertebrates in primary and selectively logged dipterocarp forests in Sabah, Malaysia. The research found that annual rates of litterfall, leaf litterfall, and leaf litter mass loss were not significantly different between primary and logged forest plots. Invertebrate abundance was higher in the primary forest, with a higher proportion of mites, pseudoscorpions, and termites. The study highlights the importance of understanding the relationship between tree species composition, litter invertebrate community, and decomposition in tropical rainforests.
