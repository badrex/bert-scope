tldr: This article explores the use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) microscopy to study the germination and early growth processes of castor beans. The authors investigate the location of water compartments and the anatomical changes that occur during germination. They find that water uptake is a triphasic process involving rapid rehydration, steady uptake during active metabolism, and a final rapid uptake during root system development. NMR microscopy offers a unique window into the water uptake process and can help understand the role of water in germination and growth.
