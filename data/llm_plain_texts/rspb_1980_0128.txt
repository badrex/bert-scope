tldr: The article discusses the nature of the earliest communicating cells and the role of neuroactive peptides in neuroendocrine cells. It speculates on the reasons for the existence of these peptides and their functions in various cell types. The author also highlights recent discoveries of Met-enkephalin in different cell locations and the distinct patterns of abnormality in multiple peptide production by endocrine tumors.
