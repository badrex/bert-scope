tldr: The author discusses the debate among philosophers about whether light travels instantaneously or requires time. M. Romer's observations of Jupiter's first satellite demonstrate that light takes time to travel, even over short distances. This discovery led to the establishment of the concept of the speed of light and its impact on time measurement.
