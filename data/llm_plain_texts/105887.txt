tldr: Joseph Priestley investigates the lateral explosion and electricity communicated to the electrical circuit in a discharge. He discovers that the lateral explosion does not transfer electricity to insulated bodies as previously thought, challenging the understanding of electricity at the time. This led to further experiments and discoveries, ultimately contributing to the advancement of knowledge in the field of electricity and magnetism.
