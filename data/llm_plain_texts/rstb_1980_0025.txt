tldr: The article discusses the petrology and formation of oolitic phosphorites found in Esprit, Aldabra. The phosphorites are divided into five petrographic groups, with oolitic phosphorites being the most common. The minerals identified are carbonatian hydroxyfluorapatites, and the primary source of the phosphate is thought to be avian guano. The phosphorites are tentatively dated as deposited 170-230 ka b.p.
