tldr: The authors studied the spatial properties of neurons in the monkey striate cortex and determined the contrast sensitivity as a function of spatial frequency for 138 neurons. They assessed the accuracy of three models, including the difference-of-Gaussians (DOG) function, in describing these functions. The DOG models were found to be superior to the Gabor function and the second differential of a Gaussian, providing a detailed description of the organization of subregions of the receptive field consistent with physiological constraints imposed by earlier stages in the visual pathway.
