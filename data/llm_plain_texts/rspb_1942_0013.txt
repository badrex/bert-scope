tldr: The study investigates the intra-uterine mortality and reproductive processes of wild rabbits. It found that between 42-56% of litters are lost before the 20th day of gestation, with most of the mortality occurring on the 11th and 12th days. The study also shows that the proportion of litters with losses increases with the initial size of the litter. The mortality rate varies depending on whether the animals are lactating, the cleaned body weight of the mother, and the month of pregnancy.
