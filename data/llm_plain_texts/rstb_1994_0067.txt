tldr: The article discusses the role of the endometrial oxytocin receptor in determining the length of the sterile oestrous cycle and ensuring the maintenance of luteal function in early pregnancy in ruminants. The oxytocin receptor plays a central role in controlling the endocrine function of the ruminant uterine endometrium. In non-pregnant cycles, the control of this molecule by circulating steroid hormones leads to the regression of the corpora lutea. In pregnancy, secretions of the trophoblast block endometrial oxytocin receptor gene expression, leading to luteal maintenance. Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the steroidal control of oxytocin receptor gene expression will provide insights into the relative constancy of oestrous cycle lengths in non-pregnant animals and the reasons for the high rate of embryonic loss in domestic ruminants.
