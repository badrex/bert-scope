tldr: This article examines the evidence from chimaeroids and fossil holocephalans to understand the origin and evolution of the Holocephali. The author discusses the hypothesis of a relationship between chimaeroids and ptyctodont arthrodires and reviews the evidence for a connection between Holocephali and selachians or arthrodires. The study concludes that chimaeroids are closest to the most primitive arthrodires, suggesting a common ancestor but not a direct relationship.
