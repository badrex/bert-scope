tldr: The authors developed a nonlinear probabilistic method to predict vessel capsizing in random beam seas, taking into account factors like sea wave spectrum, nonlinear righting moment, and nonlinear damping. They used a single degree-of-freedom model for roll motion and combined ideas from modern nonlinear dynamics and random vibrations. The study found an excellent correlation between the rate of phase space flux and the probability of capsizing.
