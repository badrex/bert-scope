tldr: The authors explore the group properties of Dirac's wave-equations and wave-operators, demonstrating that they generate groups of order 32. They also classify the operators of a group and show that any matrix can be expressed as a linear function of the 16 matrices of a fundamental set. Furthermore, they discuss the invariance of the wave-equation under transformations and the connection between the transformation matrix and wave-operators.
