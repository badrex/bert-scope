tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the character of muscular contractions resulting from the excitation of different parts of the motor tract. They found that the rhythm of muscular response maintains a constant rate of approximately ten per second, independent of the excitation rate. This research provides insights into the normal rate of discharge of nervous impulses and the rhythm of voluntary contractions in both animals and humans.
