tldr: The authors study the propagation of elastic waves in a homogeneous but anisotropic medium, using Fourier transforms to describe the waves produced by a local initial disturbance. The solution consists of a continuous wave and multiple sharp waves, with the nature of the waves being more complicated in highly anisotropic media. The geometry of the wave surface, which may be quite complex, determines the characteristics of the solution.
