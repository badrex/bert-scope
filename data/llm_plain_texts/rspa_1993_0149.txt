tldr: The authors derive the spectral representation of polynomial operator pencils using the Laplace transform. They convert the eigenvalue problem into an initial-value problem and obtain the spectral representation in the form of an inverse Laplace transform of the Green's operator associated with the operator pencil. This method provides a simple and systematic approach to non-standard eigenvalue problems for linear operators.
