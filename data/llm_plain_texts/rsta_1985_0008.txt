revised_title: Organic Superconductors: Low-Dimensional Conductors and Anomalous Superconductors
semantic_tags:
  - Superconductivity
  - Low-dimensional conductors
  - Organic compounds
  - Anomalous superconductors
  - One-dimensional physics
tldr: This article discusses the electrical and magnetic properties of low-dimensional solids, specifically organic superconductors. It explores the unique characteristics of TMTSF series conductors, which have open Fermi surfaces and exhibit one-dimensional properties. The article also reviews the anisotropic properties of these conductors and their relation to low-dimensional physics, focusing on the interplay between ground states of different natures and the influence of fluctuations on the electronic properties.
