tldr: Benjamin Wilson conducted experiments on electricity, focusing on the flow of the electric fluid through various materials and the effects of different circumstances on electrification. He discovered that a plus or minus electricity can be produced at will by carefully attending to the form of the bodies, their position, and the degrees of electrifying. This research helped improve the understanding of electricity and its applications.
