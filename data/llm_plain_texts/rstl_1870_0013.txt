tldr: The author discusses a distinct form of transient hemiopsia, a vision disorder affecting the retina, which has been overlooked by previous observers. The author describes the unique characteristics of this form, such as its gradual increase, motion, form, and color, and distinguishes it from permanent hemiopsia. This study contributes to the understanding of visual derangements and their causes.
