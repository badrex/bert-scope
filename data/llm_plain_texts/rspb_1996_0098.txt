tldr: Researchers developed a mathematical model to understand the differences in collagen fibre formation during foetal and adult dermal wound healing. The model focuses on the stimulus for collagen synthesis due to the secretion of transforming growth factor isoforms. Numerical simulations show a higher ratio of type III to type I collagen in adult wound healing, leading to thinner collagen fibres and scar tissue formation. The model suggests that topical application of TGF isoforms during healing could potentially improve adult wound repair.
