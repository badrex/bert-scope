tldr: 'The article explores the effects of dispersal on the stability of host-parasitoid systems. It shows that the existence of a "pool" of dispersing hosts and/or parasitoids can stabilize population models, even in the absence of spatial heterogeneity in birth and death rates. The study considers separate effects of host and parasitoid dispersal, and then analyzes the situation when both hosts and parasitoids move between patches, concluding that dispersal per se stabilizes the interaction.'
