tldr: This paper investigates the input limits of x-ray generators, focusing on line focuses on stationary and moving targets. The authors present calculations and an experiment with a rotating anode, showing that the formula for the input limit gives the correct order of magnitude. The study is relevant for applications of x-rays in various fields.
