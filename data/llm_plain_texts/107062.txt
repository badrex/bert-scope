tldr: In this article, William Herschel describes his experiments on solar and terrestrial rays that cause heat. He discovers that heat-making rays have a greater refrangibility than light rays, leading to the discovery of invisible infrared radiation. He also demonstrates that the dispersion of heat-making rays and light rays by a prism is different, and that achromatic refractions can be used to correct this dispersion. This work expanded our understanding of the relationship between heat and light and paved the way for further research in the field of optics.
