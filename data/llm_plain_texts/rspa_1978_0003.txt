tldr: This article explores the role of group theory in general relativity, specifically focusing on the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs group. It explains how studying the asymptotic symmetry group can provide insights into the energy, momentum, and angular momentum structure of curved space-times. The author argues that group theory is essential in understanding the covariance principles, highly symmetric solutions, and quantum field theory in curved backgrounds.
