tldr: The study investigates the taxonomic status of Leishmania peruviana, the causative agent of Peruvian 'uta', by examining its development in the sandfly Lutzomyia longipalpis. The research concludes that L. peruviana is distinct from L. tropica and L. major and is closely related to subspecies of L. braziliensis within the section Peripylaria, indicating its indigenous origin in the American continent.
