tldr: This article examines the geochemical differences among Hawaiian volcanoes, focusing on the intershield variations in major and trace element abundances, as well as radiogenic isotope ratios. The findings provide insights into the mantle sources and the processes associated with plume-related volcanism. The study reveals that each volcano has distinct magma ascent paths and that the sources of each shield contain isotopically distinct components, which contribute to the differences in composition and isotopic ratios of Sr, Nd, and Pb.
