tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the existence of potassium hyposulphite in the solid residue of fired gunpowder. They found that the discovery of hyposulphite in the powder residue is a result of slight variations during the explosion process. The authors also discovered that the method used by Bunsen and Schischkoff for treating powder residues may produce hyposulphite, leading to incorrect results.
