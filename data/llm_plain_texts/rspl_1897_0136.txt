tldr: The author conducted a series of experiments to determine if the velocity of light is affected by the presence of moving matter. They used various methods, such as rotating steel disks and a massive iron lump, and observed the light through interference fringes. The results showed that the velocity of light was not appreciably affected, suggesting that there is no significant mechanical connection between ether and matter.
