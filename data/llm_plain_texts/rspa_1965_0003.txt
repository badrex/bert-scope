tldr: The author presents a new class of solutions for the Klein-Gordon equation, free of singularities, involving an arbitrary constant in addition to the mass parameter. The model suggests a particle with half-life and a radius of 1. The author also explores the behavior of the field and its decay in time, as well as the numerical values for the mass and half-life of a meson.
