tldr: The author modifies the expansion method, a perturbative technique for nonlinear problems, to improve its convergence properties. The method is applied to a zero-dimensional field theory and the one-dimensional stationary Schrödinger equation, resulting in excellent numerical results. The modified expansion is a practical tool for solving nonlinear problems with high accuracy.
