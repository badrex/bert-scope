tldr: This article discusses the process of nerve-muscle signal transmission and the role of acetylcholine (ACh) in this process. ACh is released by the nerve impulse and acts as a powerful stimulant on the synaptic region of the muscle fiber, causing it to contract. The release and action of ACh are localized to the nerve-muscle junction, making it an essential part of the communication between nerve and muscle cells.
