tldr: This article investigates the noise generated by imperfectly expanded supersonic jets, focusing on the turbulent mixing layer and the interaction between the jet structure and the surrounding air. The authors analyze the dominant turbulent characteristics and the scattering of sound waves, providing insights into the mechanisms of jet noise and its potential applications in aviation.
