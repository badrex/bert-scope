tldr: The author investigates the scattering of protons by protons using the Moller-Rosenfeld version of the meson theory of nuclear forces. They analyze the interaction between two nucleons and compare the experimental results with the theory's predictions. The study helps determine the mass of the meson and provides insights into the relationship between neutron-proton and proton-proton interactions.
