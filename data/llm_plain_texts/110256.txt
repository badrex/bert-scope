tldr: The author, Robert Were Fox, observed that the magnetic intensity is subject to sudden and short variations, which he could not attribute to any obvious cause except when accompanied by the appearance of the aurora borealis. He inferred that the earth's magnetism might be derived from electric currents existing both under and above its surface, and that rapid fluctuations in its intensity are due to meteorological changes. Fox concluded that the aurora borealis is an electrical phenomenon, moving from north to south during the night and in the opposite direction during the day, and that it is of positive electrical nature, with an elevation above the earth of thousands of miles.
