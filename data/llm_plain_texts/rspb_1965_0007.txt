tldr: 'The authors discuss the development of soil profiles and habitats in the post-Glacial era. They analyze the time required for soil maturation and the factors influencing soil formation, such as climate, hydrology, and vegetation. The study of buried soils provides insights into the changes in soil genesis and the impact of human activities on the environment. The authors propose a mechanism for the degradation of ecosystems and the onset of podsolization due to human interference and changes in vegetation.'
