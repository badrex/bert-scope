tldr: Researchers discovered a spatial pattern in the orientation flight of the wasp Vespula vulgaris. During their first departure from a feeder, wasps perform a flight consisting of arcs roughly centered on the feeder. At the end of each arc, the wasp turns to face the feeder. These inspection points are precisely arranged along lines extending out from the feeder. The alignment of these inspections aids in the acquisition of spatial information about the goal's location.
