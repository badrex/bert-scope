tldr: 'The author, David Brewster, examines the development and extinction of doubly refracting structures in the crystalline lenses of animals after death. He observes the changes in lens structures over time, noting the differences in structure and refraction between various animals and ages. Brewster's findings contribute to the understanding of the optical properties of animal lenses and the role of light refraction in their function.'
