tldr: This study investigates the immunogenicity of antigens encoded by the murine major histocompatibility complex (H-2) and their capacity to induce neonatal tolerance. The authors found that Class I alloantigens (K and D region genes) are less effective as tolerogens compared to Class II alloantigens (I region genes). However, when Class I and Class II alloantigens are combined in the tolerizing inoculum, Class I alloantigens become better tolerogens. The I subregions responsible for this tolerance-promoting effect are IJ and/or IE.
