tldr: This study presents an approach to modeling single ion channels using alternating renewal theory, which allows for grouping individual states into classes based on independent and identically distributed sojourn times. The model considers the effects of limited time resolution on observable events and derives the cumulants and Laplace transform for a range of Markov and non-Markov models. The theory can be used for future inferential studies that account for limited time resolution in single channel records.
