  - Sartorius muscle
tldr: The authors studied the chemical energetics of muscle contraction in sartorius muscles. They found that the efficiency of these muscles was high, with the most energy being used for mechanical work. The efficiency was over 90% when using ATP as the only energy source. The amount of ATP used for processes other than mechanical work, like calcium pumping, was about one quarter of the total. The efficiency was highest at a constant shortening velocity of 2.
