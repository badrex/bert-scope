tldr: This article explores the historical context and legacy of Isaac Newton's Principia, specifically its impact on the understanding of comets. Newton's work in the Principia provided a foundation for understanding comets as celestial objects influenced by the Sun's gravitational force. The article delves into the correspondence between Newton and other scientists, such as John Flamsteed and Edmond Halley, and their discussions on cometary orbits, physical states, and the role of magnetism. The author highlights the significance of Newton's comet studies and their lasting impact on the field of cometary science.
