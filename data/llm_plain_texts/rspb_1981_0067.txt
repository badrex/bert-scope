tldr: This study investigates the organization and synaptic ultrastructure of glomeruli in the antennal lobes of the moth Manduca sexta. The antennal lobes receive input from olfactory neurons and contain all recognizable chemical synapses. The research explores the anatomical substrate for olfactory processing in Manduca sexta, providing insights into the functional specificity of glomeruli and their role in olfactory information processing.
