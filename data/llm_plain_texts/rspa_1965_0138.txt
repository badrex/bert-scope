tldr: 'The authors studied the thermal stability and rearrangement of field-evaporated tungsten surfaces. They observed edge atom displacements and changes in local curvature after heating. The results showed that heating caused flattening at specific crystallographic orientations and the formation of long straight sections of close-packed atoms at the edges of (011) layers.'
