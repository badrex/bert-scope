tldr: This study examines how honeybees recognize and analyze pattern orientation. The research shows that orientation discrimination improves with the length and collinearity of pattern elements and that bees can better distinguish patterns with homogeneous intensity bars. These findings suggest that orientation is analyzed globally, and the strength of the orientation signal increases with the length and collinearity of the pattern's elements.
