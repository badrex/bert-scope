revised_title: Combustion in Dried Oxygen: The Role of Water Vapour and Platinum
semantic_tags:
  - Combustion
  - Oxygen
  - Water Vapour
  - Platinum
  - Carbon Oxidation
tldr: This article investigates the chemical changes that occur during combustion, particularly in the oxidation of carbon, sulfur, and phosphorus. The author explores the role of water vapor and the influence of platinum on the combustion process. The findings suggest that water vapor plays a significant part in the oxidation process, and the presence of platinum influences the products of combustion but does not cause the union of dry carbon with dry oxygen.
