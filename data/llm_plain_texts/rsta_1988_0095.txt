tldr: The article discusses the challenges and benefits of solving scientific problems using multiprocessor machines, specifically focusing on reconfigurable transputer networks. It introduces the transputer, a powerful chip that provides processing power, memory, and communication hardware, and the programming language OCCAM, which supports concurrent computation and communication between processes. The author also highlights the importance of parallel programming strategies and potential issues like non-determinacy and deadlock in parallel computing.
