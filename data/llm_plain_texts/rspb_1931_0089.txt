tldr: The author conducted filtration experiments to determine the filtration end-point for the virus of infectious ectromelia. They found that a membrane of 0.2 µm effectively retained the virus. The author also developed a method to concentrate the virus and remove tissue proteins, which improved the optical transparency of the medium for microscopical studies. This research provided a better understanding of the virus and its detection through filtration and microscopy.
