revised_title: Radiation Field Problem and Uniqueness Theorem in Wave Equations
semantic_tags:
  - Wave equation
  - Radiation field
  - Uniqueness theorem
  - Holmgren's theorem
  - Characteristic initial value problem
tldr: The article discusses the radiation field problem and its relation to the wave equation. It introduces a new method using a simple transformation of variables and an appeal to Holmgren's uniqueness theorem. The author also extends the uniqueness theorem to characteristic initial value problems and demonstrates its application to the radiation field problem.
