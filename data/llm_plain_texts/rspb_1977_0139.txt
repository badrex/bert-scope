tldr: The study investigates the de-iodination of labelled protein during intestinal transmission in suckling rats. It found that a large proportion of the fed radioactive diiodotyrosine (125DIT) dose undergoes de-iodination, with no significant incorporation of 125DIT or inorganic iodide 125I into protein during transmission across the intestine. The main aim was to investigate whether iodine can be removed from iodo-protein during transmission in young rats and whether the released iodine or iodinated amino acids can be re-incorporated into protein.
