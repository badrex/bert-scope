tldr: The author, John F. W. Herschel, explores the chemical action of solar spectrum rays on silver preparations and discusses the development of photographic processes. He discovers that the intensity of chemical action is not always connected with the colorific impressions of the rays and discusses the use of hyposulphites for fixing photographic impressions. He also examines the reproduction of photographs and the scientific aspects of the photographic art.
