tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the excretion of nitrogen by the skin, challenging previous methods and findings. They developed a new method to measure the entire cutaneous excretion of nitrogen in a given time without reference to measurement or actual amount of sweat excreted. The results showed that the skin does excrete nitrogen, contributing to a better understanding of human physiology.
