tldr: The author discusses Arbogast's method of derivations, a technique for finding combinations of letters with given degrees and weights. The article demonstrates how to apply this method to form a single column of terms and explores the concept of expansions and contractions to manipulate these terms. The author also compares the process to genealogical trees and primogeniture.
