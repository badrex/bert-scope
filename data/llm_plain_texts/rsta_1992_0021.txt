tldr: This article explores the nonlinear dynamics of engineering systems and introduces the Birkhoff signature change as a criterion for the instability of chaotic resonance. The authors observe a relation between a specific homoclinic orbit and the primary chaotic escape event, providing a general criterion for chaotic escape that does not depend on the fine details of the system's location and nature. This criterion can be used to understand the complex behavior of engineering systems and improve their stability and performance.
