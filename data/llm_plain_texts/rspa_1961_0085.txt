tldr: The authors studied the peroxides formed during the slow combustion of hydrocarbons and their role in the oxidation mechanism. They identified and estimated the yields of peroxides in the combustion products of various hydrocarbons. The results suggest that peroxides play a significant role in the oxidation process, with chain branching due to homogeneous peroxide decomposition being important up to around 350Â°C.
