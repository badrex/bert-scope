tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the specificity and action of gastrotoxin in vitro. They discovered that two distinct immune bodies are produced during the process of immunization: an increase in the normal haemolysin of the rabbit and a newly-formed haemolysin complemented by guinea-pig serum. The author also demonstrated that gastrotoxin has the power to produce changes in soluble proteins, protoplasmic granules, and gastric cells. These findings have important implications for understanding the multiplicity of immune bodies and their actions.
