tldr: This article discusses the use of nuclear emulsion techniques in high-energy physics experiments, particularly in studying the properties of elementary particles. The high spatial resolution of nuclear emulsion allows for the measurement of particle tracks and the identification of hypernuclei and hyperfragments. The technique is particularly useful for experiments involving high-energy accelerators and has contributed significantly to the understanding of particle interactions and the binding of hyperons in matter.
