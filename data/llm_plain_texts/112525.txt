tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments to determine the specific heat of various mixtures of alcohol and water. They found that the specific heat of these mixtures, up to an alcoholic strength of about 36%, is higher than the specific heat of water itself. Two different methods were employed to measure the specific heat, and the results showed that the specific heat of the mixtures was above the calculated mean specific heat up to an alcoholic strength of about 74-80%.'
