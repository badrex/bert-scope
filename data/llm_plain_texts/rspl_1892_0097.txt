tldr: The author investigates the knee-jerk reaction and the correlation of action of antagonistic muscles. They discovered that the spinal center responsible for this reaction is located in the lumbar segments of the spinal cord. The afferent path, which consists of sensory fibers from muscles, is responsible for the knee-jerk reaction. The efferent path, which includes motor nerve fibers to the muscles, is responsible for the antagonistic muscle action. The author also found that these paths are interconnected and work together to create the knee-jerk reaction.
