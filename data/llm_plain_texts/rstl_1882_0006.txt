tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments to determine if the velocity of light depends on its color. They used an improved version of the Fizeau experiment, which involved using two distant reflectors and a rotating toothed wheel. The results showed that different colors of light travel at different speeds, with more refrangible rays traveling more rapidly through a vacuum. This discovery had significant implications for the understanding of the properties of the ether.'
