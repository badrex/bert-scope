revised_title: 'The Interaction of Short-term and Long-term Effects in Chaffinch Mobbing Behavior'
semantic_tags:
  - Animal Behavior
  - Habituation
  - Extinction
  - Adaptation
  - Fatigue
tldr: 'This study investigates the changes in the strength of a partially inborn response, such as the mobbing behavior of chaffinches, and the interaction of short-term and long-term incremental and decremental effects. The research shows that the initial presentation of a stimulus leads to diverse changes in the response characteristics, suggesting that concepts like habituation, extinction, adaptation, and fatigue may not represent a unitary underlying process.'
