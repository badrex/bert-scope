tldr: The authors investigate the spin-dependent changes in the electromagnetic energy of a system when a neutral atom is placed between infinite, parallel, perfectly conducting plates. They calculate the leading spin-dependent effects and find that the change in the magnetic moment of an electron bound in the atom is of the order of the fine structure constant. The change in the hyperfine splitting is of the order of the Bohr radius, which falls many orders of magnitude short of the experimental upper limit. The authors also discuss the differences between bound and free electrons and the need for a fully relativistic calculation for free electrons.
