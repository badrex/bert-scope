tldr: The author's study of 18 Heliconiini species and 10 non-heliconiine comimics found that morphological parameters related to flight biomechanics are associated with three escape tactics: evasive flight, distastefulness, and mimicry. The positions of centres of body and wing mass, as well as wing shape, were identified as key features. Mimicry groups, composed of more palatable species, had centres of mass closer to the wing base, which may increase flight speed and turning performance. This research suggests that convergent selection may enhance the morphological diversification of palatable and unpalatable butterflies within lineages that have more recently evolved distastefulness.
