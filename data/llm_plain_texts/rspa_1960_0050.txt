tldr: The article discusses the impact of environmental factors on molecular energy levels and spectra. It explains how the environment can affect the energy levels of a molecule, the observable spectrum of a molecular aggregate, and the interaction between molecules. The authors also explore the differences between the spectra of liquids, gases, and solids, and the effects of pressure and density on molecular spectra.
