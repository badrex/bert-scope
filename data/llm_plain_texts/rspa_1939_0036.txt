tldr: The authors conducted experiments on bismuth crystals to study the de Haas-van Alphen effect, which measures the change in magnetic susceptibility due to changes in magnetic field strength. They used a new method to measure the couple acting on the crystal in a uniform magnetic field, allowing them to study the effect at lower field strengths. The results were compared to Landau's theory, helping to deduce the effective masses, chemical potential, and number of electrons responsible for the de Haas-van Alphen effect in bismuth.
