tldr: The authors studied insect fossils found in deposits from the Tame Valley, Warwickshire, dating back to the last glaciation. They identified approximately 100 fossil insect species, many of which are now extinct in Britain. The insect fauna and the recovered climate data suggest a cooler and more continental climate than present-day Britain. The authors propose the name "Upton Warren Interstadial Complex" for these deposits, which provide valuable insights into the climate and environment during the last glaciation.
