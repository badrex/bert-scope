  - Stream Bed Equilibrium
tldr: This study investigates the conditions under which grains on the bed of a stream begin to move, considering factors such as the speed of the stream, the nature of the motion, and the size of the grains. The author develops equations to describe the equilibrium of grains and tests these equations through various experiments, providing insights into the forces at play in stream beds and the conditions necessary for sediment transport.
