tldr: The article discusses the progress made in understanding the biochemistry of nitrogen fixation. It covers the discovery of the role of ferredoxin as an electron carrier, the involvement of hydrogen metabolism, and the enzymic system responsible for nitrogen fixation. The author also presents a reaction series for nitrogen fixation and discusses questions and challenges related to the purification and function of the enzyme constituents.
