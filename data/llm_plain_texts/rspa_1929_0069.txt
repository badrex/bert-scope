tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the interaction of ions and the "clean up" of gases at glass surfaces under the influence of electrical discharge. They found that the quantity of gas disappeared was directly proportional to the quantity of electricity transferred across the glass walls, and the disappearance of gas depends on the previous treatment of the glass, following similar laws to Faraday's laws of electrolysis.
