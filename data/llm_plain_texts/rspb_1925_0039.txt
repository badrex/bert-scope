tldr: The author discovered a respiratory pigment called cytochrome, which is present in a wide range of animals, yeast, and higher plants. Cytochrome has a unique absorption spectrum with four bands, and it is a complex compound made up of three distinct haemochromogen compounds. This pigment is essential for understanding cellular respiration and energy production in living organisms.
