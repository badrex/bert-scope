tldr: This article is an erratum for a previous paper on truncation theorems for spinodals and critical points of mean-field models for polydisperse polymer solutions. The authors corrected an incorrect statement in the original paper and provided a correct form of the theorem. The usefulness of the work remains unaffected as long as the corrected theorem is used.
