tldr: The article investigates the effects of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) on synaptic acetylcholine receptor-channels in rat muscle fibers. The study found that CGRP significantly increased the variance of the acetylcholine receptor-channel amplitude distribution at the synaptic region of muscle fibers. This suggests that CGRP may regulate the synaptic acetylcholine receptor-channel conductance through second messenger systems.
