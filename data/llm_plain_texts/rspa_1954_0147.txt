tldr: The authors examined the absorption spectrum of gaseous aluminium monofluoride in the Schumann region and discovered six new singlet band-systems. They also analyzed the vibrational and electronic constants of the singlet states and discussed the atomic products of dissociation of these states. This research contributes to the understanding of the chemical bonding and electronic transitions in aluminium monofluoride.
