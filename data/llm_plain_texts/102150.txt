tldr: 'The author describes a new type of horse-drawn vehicle called a Calesh, invented by someone they met in London. This Calesh has two wheels and is lighter and more stable than a common coach. It can easily handle uneven terrain and can be disengaged from the horse with ease if needed. The author and their friends were impressed with the invention and decided to order one for themselves. The Calesh weighs around six to eight pounds and is considered a useful and innovative addition to transportation.'
