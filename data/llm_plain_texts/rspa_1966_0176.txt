tldr: The authors present an expansion method to improve the Hartree-Fock approximation for calculating atomic properties, specifically transition matrix elements. They discuss the limitations of the Hartree-Fock approximation and propose a generalization to reduce the first-order error. The method is applied to helium, and the results show improved accuracy for electric dipole transitions.
