tldr: This article discusses the unique micrometeorological behavior of forests and their impact on the surface energy balance. It presents a coupled model that accounts for the interaction between surface fluxes and the overlying planetary boundary layer, including the entrainment process at the top of the boundary layer. The model considers factors such as net radiation, sensible and latent heat flux, and soil heat flux, and is designed to describe the stable, unstable, and neutral atmospheric conditions.
