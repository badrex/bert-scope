tldr: This article discusses the development of face perception and recognition in children and how it improves with age. It highlights the differences in encoding faces between young children and adults, and how the inversion effect increases with age. The author argues that part of the improvement in face recognition is due to the acquisition of knowledge specific to faces, which cannot be applied as efficiently to inverted faces.
