tldr: This study investigates the hydrogenation of ethylene and propene, focusing on the mercury-photosensitized hydrogenation process. The researchers determined the disproportionation-to-combination ratio of ethyl and isopropyl radicals, finding that under suitable conditions, the ratio agrees with values obtained from other sources. The hydrogenation of propene was studied using vapor-phase chromatography and mass spectrometry, revealing that the disproportionation-to-combination ratio for isopropyl radicals varies with pressure, similar to ethyl radicals. The results indicate that hot radical effects increase the ratio at lower pressures.
