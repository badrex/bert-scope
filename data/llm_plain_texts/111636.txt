  - Vapour condensation
tldr: The author, Thomas Hopkins, argues that the heat from condensing vapour is the cause of great currents in the air and ocean. He explains that these currents are created by vacua in specific locations where much vapour has been condensed, leading to an imbalance in atmospheric pressure. Hopkins also discusses how primary ocean currents are influenced by winds, which can force water to move as currents. He concludes that heat from vapour is the main force responsible for the continuous movements in both the atmosphere and the ocean.
