tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of centrifugal fields on turbulent flame structure and burning velocities. They found that centrifugal fields can cause hot gas pockets to coalesce in vortex cores, which can enhance flame stability and control mixing of hot products with cold reactants. The results showed that promoting the drift of hot gas and radicals into the reactants can produce a slight augmentation of the reaction rate.
