tldr: The author developed a new liquid interferometer that overcomes the limitations of traditional glass plate interferometers, allowing for higher resolving power and sharper interference bands. The device uses a thin layer of liquid, such as water or castor oil, and employs a unique mounting system to minimize surface tremors and improve stability. This innovation has significant implications for the field of optics and interferometry.
