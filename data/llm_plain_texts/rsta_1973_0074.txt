tldr: This article presents numerical solutions to the kinematic dynamo problem, focusing on the expansion method of Bullard and Gellman. The author investigates the efficiency of the dynamo, the expulsion of magnetic flux, and the structure of the magnetic field. The study provides insights into the Earth's magnetic field and its potential maintenance by a dynamo mechanism in the core.
