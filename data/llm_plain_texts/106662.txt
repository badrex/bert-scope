tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the acidity principle, decomposition of water, and phlogiston. They discovered that the decomposition of dephlogisticated and inflammable air produces an acid liquor, which contains nitrous and marine acids. The author also found that different substances from which dephlogisticated air was extracted may affect the resulting acid composition. The experiments provide insights into the chemical reactions and processes involving air, water, and metal corrosion.
