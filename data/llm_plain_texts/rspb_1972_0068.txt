tldr: The article describes a direct method for reconstructing three-dimensional structures from projections in electron microscopy. The method, known as back-projection, involves summing projected densities and subtracting a constant term. The authors show that this method is equivalent to Fourier synthesis using central sections of the Fourier transform of the object. The method is suitable for specimens with rotational or helical symmetry and can be used to improve the resolution of electron micrographs.
