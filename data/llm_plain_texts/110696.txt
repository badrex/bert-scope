tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the electro-chemical equivalents of sodium and potassium. They used a solution of dichloride of copper in muriatic acid and found that the equivalent of copper was approximately double its atomic weight. This research was communicated by Michael Faraday and was based on numerous observations made at the P. Louis Observatory in Mauritius.
