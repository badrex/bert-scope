tldr: Thomas Simpson's paper presents a general rule for resolving isoperimetrical problems of all orders. He introduces an elegant method that can be applied to various cases in natural philosophy, providing a way to find maximum or minimum values for quantities depending on a line, space, or body with unknown figures. This method is based on calculus and involves finding the fluxions of the given expressions and using them to create an equation that expresses the relation between the variables.
