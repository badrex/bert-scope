tldr: The Earl of Rosse conducted experiments to determine the source of heat coming from the moon. Using a thermopile and a telescope, he found that the moon's heat mainly comes from the sun's heat being absorbed by the lunar surface and then radiated back to Earth. This research helped to understand the composition of the moon's heat and its relationship to solar radiation.
