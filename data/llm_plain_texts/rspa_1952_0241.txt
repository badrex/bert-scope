revised_title: 'A Discussion on Friction: Reply to Professor Simon's Comments'
semantic_tags:
  - Friction
  - Energetics
  - Rolling friction
  - Gliding friction
  - Mechanical equivalent of heat
tldr: The authors discuss the transformation of free energy into heat during the frictional process. They address questions raised by Professor Simon about the mechanism of energy transformation and the difference between rolling and gliding friction. They also mention the work of Taylor and Quinney on the liberation of heat during the deformation of metals.
