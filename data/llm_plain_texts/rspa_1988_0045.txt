tldr: The sound field generated by an elliptic cylinder moving in a rectilinear motion is analyzed. The study focuses on the fluid dynamics and acoustics of the system, with the cylinder's movement characterized by a small Mach number. The research determines the potential of the sound field at great distances from the cylinder, describing it in terms of moving line source and multipole potentials with singularities at the center of the cylinder.
