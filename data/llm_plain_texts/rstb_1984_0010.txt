tldr: This article investigates the effects of various drugs on the high-pressure neurological syndrome (h.p.n.s.) in animals. The authors found that some drugs protect against h.p.n.s., while others have no effect or exacerbate the syndrome. They also discovered that drugs interacting with neurotransmitter systems, such as catecholamine and GABA, play a significant role in h.p.n.s. The study emphasizes the importance of considering both non-specific and selective actions of drugs under high-pressure conditions.
