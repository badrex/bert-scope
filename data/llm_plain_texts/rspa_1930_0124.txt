tldr: The authors conducted experiments with amines to study the stability and behavior of unimolecular films. They discovered that solid condensed films of amines can have two different areas depending on the temperature and solution's pH. This dimorphism is similar to crystal forms in three dimensions, and the cause of the different tilts is still under investigation.
