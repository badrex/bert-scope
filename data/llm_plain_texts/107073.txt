tldr: The author observed the transit of Mercury over the sun's disk and investigated the causes that often prevent the proper action of mirrors. They found that atmospheric conditions, such as fog, moisture, and frost, can significantly impact the performance of telescopes and mirrors. The author also discovered that damp air does not affect the specula, while frost and ice can hinder vision.
