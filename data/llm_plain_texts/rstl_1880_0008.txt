tldr: The authors conducted extensive experiments on various types of gunpowder to analyze the gaseous and solid products of their explosions. They discussed the chemical reactions, heat generation, and pressures involved in the process. The authors also examined the formation of potassium hyposulphite and its role in the explosion of gunpowder. Their research aimed to improve understanding of the composition and effects of fired gunpowder for practical applications.
