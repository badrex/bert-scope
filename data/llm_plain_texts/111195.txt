tldr: The author conducted experiments to create a new form of instrument for correcting compass errors caused by the presence of iron in ships. They investigated the nature of iron attraction on the poles of magnets and designed a compound needle that could help determine the amount of deviation due to iron masses. The author believed that further experiments were needed to make the instrument simple and accurate enough for general use.
