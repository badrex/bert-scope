tldr: This article introduces a new theory of asymptotic series and their characteristics, which helps in understanding the behavior of functions with non-convergent series. The author discusses the work of Poincaré and Borel, and proposes a new approach using the concept of "orders of infinity" to analyze and define the characteristics of asymptotic series. The theory has potential applications in expanding functions in series of inverse factorials and determining the number of terms needed for accurate approximations.
