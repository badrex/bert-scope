tldr: This article explores the importance of the temporal context of spatial memory in animal intelligence, specifically in foraging strategies. The author discusses various experiments with different species, examining memory processes such as primacy, recency, proactive interference, retroactive interference, decay, consolidation, and chunking. The results provide insights into the types of memory animals use when searching for food and demonstrate the value of combining psychological and ethological approaches in studying animal intelligence.
