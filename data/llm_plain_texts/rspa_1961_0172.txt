tldr: This study investigates the deformation of solids caused by high-speed liquid impact, focusing on the behavior of a liquid jet projected against a solid surface at velocities up to 1200. The research explores the impact load, deformation patterns, and the role of the liquid's compressible behavior and high-speed flow on solid surfaces. The findings have implications for understanding the erosion of aircraft and turbine blades.
