tldr: This article discusses the reaction between zinc and a mixture of iodide of ethyl and oxalate of methyl, resulting in the formation of a crystalline mass and the production of an ethereal body. The authors analyze the composition and properties of this new ether, which they find to be the methylic ether of an acid similar to leucic acid. They also compare this acid to another related acid in the lactic series.
