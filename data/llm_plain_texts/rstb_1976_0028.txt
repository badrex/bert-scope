tldr: This article discusses the role of plant hormones, particularly cytokinins, in plant water relations and responses to environmental stress. The authors explain how cytokinins can help plants adapt to varying environmental conditions by regulating processes such as leaf ageing, stomatal opening, and protein degradation. They also present evidence that shows how stress, such as water deficits or salinity, can reduce the levels of cytokinins in plant exudates, leading to changes in plant metabolism.
