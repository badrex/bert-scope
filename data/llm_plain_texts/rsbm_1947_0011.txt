tldr: 'Thomas Hunt Morgan was a renowned American geneticist and embryologist who made significant contributions to the fields of genetics and embryology. He is best known for his work with Drosophila melanogaster, which led to the discovery of sex linkage and the understanding of genetic linkage through chromosome mapping. Morgan also made important contributions to experimental embryology, challenging the mosaic theory of differentiation and demonstrating the concept of regulation in early development.'
