tldr: This study investigates a chemical reaction system with two-stage decay, where each stage exhibits Arrhenius temperature dependence. The authors use degenerate bifurcation theory and numerical analysis to explore the system's behavior across the entire parameter space. They identify various degenerate bifurcations and find that the system exhibits 16 distinct phase portraits. The research reveals some unique behavior in phase and parameter space, which seems to be common in thermokinetic systems with more than one Arrhenius nonlinearity.
