tldr: The authors conducted experiments using a transparent sapphire cutting tool to study the frictional interactions between the chip and rake face during continuous chip formation. They discovered two distinct zones along the rake face, with the first zone showing relative movement at the chip-tool interface and the second zone experiencing gross transfer of material onto the tool. The study provides insights into the contact conditions and tool wear in machining processes.
