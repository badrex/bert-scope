tldr: The study investigates the convergence and divergence of cones onto bipolar cells in the central area of the cat retina. It reveals that each type of bipolar cell has access to all the cones, with an average convergence of 5.1, 6.0, and 5.7 for types b1, b2, and b4, respectively. The dendrites of these bipolar cells connect with all the pedicles within their reach, without skipping any. The study provides insights into the potential advantages of encoding the cone signal into multiple, parallel, narrow-field pathways, such as tuning of pathways for different temporal frequencies, using ion channels with widely separated equilibrium potentials, and forming different regulatory circuits in the inner plexiform layer.
