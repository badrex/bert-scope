tldr: In this letter, Mr. Newton further explains his theory of light and colors, particularly the concept of whiteness. He also discusses the possibility of perfecting telescopes by using reflections instead of refractions. He shares his experiments and findings on the properties of light and colors, as well as his thoughts on the challenges and potential solutions for improving telescope design.
