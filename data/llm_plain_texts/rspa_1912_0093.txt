tldr: The authors describe improvements made to a measuring machine based on the principle of electric touch, which allows for more accurate dimensional measurements of regular solids. The new machine features increased strength and rigidity, improved table design, enhanced measuring ends, an innovation for making absolute measurements, and side girders to reduce friction and strain. This machine is designed to overcome the limitations of traditional engineering machines and provides a more precise and reliable method for measuring dimensions.
