revised_title: 'The Effect of Light on Organic Compounds and Photosynthesis in the Presence of Inorganic Colloids'

  - Nitrite formation
tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of light on organic compounds and the role of inorganic colloids in photosynthesis. They discovered that scattered light is almost completely polarized and that the blue color of the sky is due to the scattering of light by air molecules. Additionally, they investigated the formation of nitrites from nitrates in aqueous solutions and their assimilation by green leaves in sunlight.
