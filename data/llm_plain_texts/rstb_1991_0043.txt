tldr: The author discusses the energetics of intramolecular reactions and enzyme catalysis. They explain that the efficiency of intramolecular reactions is due to differences in entropy and strain energy. Enzymes do not solely rely on chemical mechanisms for rate enhancement; the forces of interaction between non-reacting parts of the substrate and enzyme also contribute to lowering the activation energy of the reaction.
