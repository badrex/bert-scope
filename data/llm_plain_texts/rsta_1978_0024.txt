tldr: The article discusses the evolution of continental crust through the study of isotopic ages and initial Sr and Pb isotopic ratios of rock formations. It suggests that the continental crust has grown through time by the accretion of island arcs and the addition of the andesitic volcanic suite. The irreversible differentiation of the mantle has produced new continental crust during several short episodes separated by time, possibly of global extent.
