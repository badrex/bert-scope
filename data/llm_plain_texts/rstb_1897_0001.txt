tldr: The author conducted experiments on isolated nerves to study the effects of carbon dioxide and fatigue. They discovered that carbon dioxide reduces nerve excitability and causes a decline in the negative variation of nerve current. This research helped to understand the differences between nerve and muscle fatigue and the role of carbon dioxide in nerve function.
