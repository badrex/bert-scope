tldr: This study investigates the connection between sunspot frequency and terrestrial magnetism using data from various locations between 1836 and 1901. The author examines different measures of magnetic disturbance and their relation to sunspot frequency, finding a remarkable uniformity in the values for declination. The results suggest that the formula E = a + 6S, where E is a magnetic quantity and S is sunspot frequency, can be applied to various magnetic data, but its accuracy decreases with more disturbed magnetic quantities.
