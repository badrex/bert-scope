tldr: The author explores passive dynamic running in a simple bipedal model, demonstrating that it can be achieved without any control or active intervention. The model reveals the central role of the hip spring's scissor motion in generating the gait, and suggests that elastic elements in animals, such as tendons and aponeurosis, govern the dynamics of their locomotion. This study contributes to understanding natural locomotion and could be applied to the design of mechanical runners.
