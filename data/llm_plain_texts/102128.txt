tldr: This article describes a case study of a man who was bitten by a mad fox and developed hydrophobia, a condition characterized by fear of water and severe muscle spasms. The author, Dr. Roger Howman, documents the patient's symptoms and treatment, including bleeding, antispasmodic remedies, and antiparalytic medications. The patient eventually died from the disease, and the author discusses the possible reasons for the paralysis and other symptoms observed during the course of the illness.
