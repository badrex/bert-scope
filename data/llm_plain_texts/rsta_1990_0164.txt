tldr: This article explores the Lagrangian approach to solving the Euler equations for fluid motion, focusing on the use of Lagrangian invariants and topological structure. The author discusses the helicity invariant for convected vector fields and its significance in understanding the topological properties of fluid flows. The article also reviews methods for determining steady Euler flows and their stability, as well as the formation of tangential discontinuities in fluid dynamics.
