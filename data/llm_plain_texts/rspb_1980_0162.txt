tldr: The article investigates the blocking action of D600 on acetylcholine-induced channels in frog endplates. D600, a calcium channel blocker, can be applied iontophoretically and rapidly blocks active channels. The blocking action persists for a long time, and the recovery process takes around 12-20 seconds. The study suggests that uncharged molecules of D600 enter the lipid phase of the membrane and bind to a site on the active ACh-receptor-channel complex, causing it to close rapidly.
