tldr: This article discusses the energy of deformation during sliding and its relation to friction. The authors analyze the deformation produced by sliding and equate it to the frictional work. They find that the surface zone absorbs a large amount of deformation energy, which is dissipated as heat. The authors also compare the work done in rolling friction and sliding friction, highlighting the differences between the two.
