tldr: An anonymous student in medicine presents the anatomy of a monstrous pig, which had an unusual reproductive and digestive system. The pig's guts were distended and transparent, with no visible signs of sex. The rectum was closed, and the ureters were inserted into the rectum. The stomach was full of a hard substance resembling curds. The student could not find a bladder or uterus and could not identify a valve in the digestive system.
