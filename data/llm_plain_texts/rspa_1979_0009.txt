tldr: The study investigates the evolution of a small amplitude initial disturbance in a straight uniform vortex sheet. It proposes an approximation to the exact evolution equation for the Fourier coefficients and demonstrates, through an asymptotic analysis, that the solution develops a singularity at a critical time. The findings suggest that the class of vortex layer motions modeled by replacing the vortex layer with a vortex sheet is limited, and the sheet is an inadequate approximation unless it is everywhere undergoing rapid stretching.
