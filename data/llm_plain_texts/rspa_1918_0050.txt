tldr: The author investigates the effect of electric waves on the Earth's surface, specifically the diffraction of radio waves by the Earth. They analyze the problem using mathematical methods and find that the physical assumptions do not account for the observed amount of action, suggesting that further physical factors, such as ionization of the upper atmosphere, may play a significant role.
