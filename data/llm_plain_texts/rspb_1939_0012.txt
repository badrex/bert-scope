tldr: This study investigates the directional sensitivity of the retina and the spectral sensitivities of rods and cones. Researchers used a new type of threshold measurement to determine the liminal brightness increment (l.b.i.) and found that the directional sensitivity of the parafoveal retina varies depending on the brightness of the conditioning stimulation. The study also provides information about the spectral sensitivities of different types of cones in foveal vision.
