tldr: This article presents a theoretical study of light scattering in binary liquid mixtures near the critical mixing point. The authors develop a theory of light scattering due to concentration fluctuations and apply it to the phenomena of critical opalescence in two-component liquid mixtures. They find that mixtures belonging to class I have a correlation function with a range of negative correlation, while those belonging to class II have a correlation function of nearly Gaussian shape. The authors also discuss the connection between light scattering and density fluctuations in fluids.
