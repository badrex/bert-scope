tldr: 'The authors studied the effects of Sepedon hæmachates venom on various animals, including frogs, rabbits, rats, cats, and pigeons. They found that the venom primarily affects the respiration, causing respiratory paralysis and leading to death. The lethal doses for different animals were determined, and the effects on the nervous system, circulation, and temperature were analyzed. The study provides insights into the venom's action and potential applications in understanding its toxicity and therapeutic uses.'
