tldr: The study investigates the behavior of kidney slices from adult rats in media that mimic the cation ratios of extracellular fluid but vary in osmolar concentration. The results show that the oxygen consumption and water content of the slices are not significantly affected by the osmolar concentration of the medium. This suggests that cells are not in osmotic equilibrium with their surroundings and that the osmotic pressure of cell fluids is typically 50 to 100 times greater than that of extracellular fluids.
