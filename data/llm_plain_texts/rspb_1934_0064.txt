tldr: 'This study investigates the measurability of visual sensation, focusing on brightness perception. The authors conducted experiments using white light and a method called bisection to determine if it is possible to create a sensation scale for brightness. They found that observers could estimate brightness, but the results did not support the creation of a scale based on just-perceptible-differences, questioning the measurability of visual sensation.'
