tldr: This study investigates the rotation and orientation of rigid conducting rods and spherical doublets in a dielectric liquid under combined shear and electric fields. The research provides a theoretical analysis and experimental results, which help to understand the behavior of particles in electrical and streaming double refraction, and the rheology and stability of sols, emulsions, and suspensions.
