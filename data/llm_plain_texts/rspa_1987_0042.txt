tldr: The authors explore the changes in chiroptical properties caused by intermolecular coupling between a chiral molecule and an achiral molecule. They use quantum electrodynamics to study the modified properties and develop a theory for calculating the changes in the rotational strengths of the chiral molecule. The theory is applied to a model one-dimensional mixed crystal, showing significant modifications in chiroptical properties.
