tldr: The author, Fra. Hauksbee, conducted experiments on the production and propagation of light from phosphorus in a vacuum. He discovered that phosphorus became luminous when placed in a vacuum and that the luminosity increased as the air was further exhausted. The light was visible until air was reintroduced, after which it vanished. This research contributed to the understanding of light production and the properties of gases in a vacuum.
