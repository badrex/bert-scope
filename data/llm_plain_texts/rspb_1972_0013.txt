tldr: The authors used gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to study the pattern of sterols in meconium and faeces from newborn infants. They found that meconium contained various metabolites from the biosynthesis of cholesterol, including lanosterol, 24,25-dihydro-A8-lanosterol, and 20($),22-dihydroxycholesterol. These findings provide a more detailed understanding of naturally occurring sterols and steroids in newborns, and their potential role in steroid hormone synthesis and bile acid metabolism.
