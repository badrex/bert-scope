tldr: The author suggests an alternative interpretation of the thermodynamics of elasticity in biological tissues, specifically muscle contraction. They propose that crystallization may play a role in the observed thermoelastic phenomena, which could explain the heat absorption and evolution found in muscle tissue. This alternative explanation challenges the existing theories and invites further research into the complex processes of muscle contraction and elasticity.
