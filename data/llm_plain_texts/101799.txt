tldr: This article describes two separate observations: the occurrence of "bloody snow" in Genoa and the anatomical structure of the nose. The bloody snow was a red-colored snow that fell on the mountains called Le Langhe and left eye witnesses. The second observation, made by Mons. du Vernay, explains the structure of the nose, which is filled with cartilaginous laminae that support the inner tunic responsible for the sense of smell.
