tldr: The author, Thomas Henshaw, conducted experiments on may-dew, a type of dew collected in the month of May. He observed that may-dew putrefied and produced various life forms, such as insects and small aquatic creatures. These creatures eventually gave birth to gnats, which multiplied in large numbers. Henshaw also extracted a grayish earth from the putrefied dew, which turned spring water purple when mixed.
