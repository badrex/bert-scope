tldr: 'Oscar Werner Tiegs was a renowned biologist who made significant contributions to the fields of zoology, invertebrate embryology, muscle physiology, arthropod evolution, and histology. His work led to the division of the Arthropoda phylum into two distinct parts, the insects and myriapods, and the Trilobites, Crustacea, and arachnids. He also discovered the helicoidal striation in muscle fibers, which he believed played a role in muscular conduction. Throughout his career, Tiegs conducted extensive research, made valuable contacts, and formed lasting friendships in the scientific community.'
