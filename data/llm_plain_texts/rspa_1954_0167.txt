tldr: The authors studied the oxidation of cyclohexyl methyl sulphide when interacting with hydroperoxides in hydrocarbons. They found that the reaction follows a different mechanism in hydrocarbon solvents compared to alcohols. The reaction with cyclohexenyl hydroperoxide in benzene or cyclohexane is insensitive to oxygen and has orders of one with respect to sulphide and two with respect to hydroperoxide. The reaction with t-butyl hydroperoxide in benzene proceeds faster in air than in a vacuum, and the oxygen catalysis is less in cyclohexane and absent in cyclohexone.
