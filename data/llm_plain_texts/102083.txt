tldr: The author describes a unique design for a 70-foot long timber bridge without any pillars under it, which can be useful in places where building pillars is inconvenient. The bridge consists of two arches of timber, with walls at each end and braces to support the structure. This design can be laid with planks and railing, and the length of the bridge is 70 feet with a height of 19 feet.
