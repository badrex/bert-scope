tldr: The authors engineered resistance against potato virus X and fungi in commercial potato cultivars using genetic engineering technology. They achieved this by expressing viral coat protein genes and antifungal proteins in transgenic plants. Four years of field trials demonstrated the commercial feasibility of improving potato cultivars by selectively adding new traits while preserving their intrinsic properties.
