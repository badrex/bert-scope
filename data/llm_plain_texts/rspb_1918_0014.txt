tldr: The author investigates the production of anthocyanins and anthocyanidins in plants, focusing on their relationship with flavonols. They provide evidence that supports the idea that anthocyan pigments may be formed through flavonols in plants. The author also discusses the presence of yellow sap-pigments, flavones, or flavonols, in flowers containing anthocyanins and the potential for further research in this area.
