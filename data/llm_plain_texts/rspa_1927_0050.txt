revised_title: Reevaluation of the Law of Flame Speeds in Gaseous Explosions
semantic_tags:
  - Combustion
  - Gas explosions
  - Flame speed
  - Chemical reactions
  - Oxygen mixtures
tldr: This article examines the supposed law of flame speeds in gaseous explosions and challenges its validity. The authors argue that the law does not hold true for complex mixtures containing two combustible gases with different properties. They present experimental results that contradict the law and suggest that further testing is needed before reaching a final conclusion on its validity.
