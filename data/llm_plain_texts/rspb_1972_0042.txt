tldr: 'This study investigates the correlation between nuclear DNA content and minimum generation time in herbaceous plants. It shows that species with shorter life cycles have a shorter mean cell cycle time, shorter mean meiotic duration, and a lower mean nuclear DNA content compared to species with longer life cycles. The research suggests that nuclear DNA content, along with its physical-mechanical effects, can determine the minimum generation time for each plant species.'
