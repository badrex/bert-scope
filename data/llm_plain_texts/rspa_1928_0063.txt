tldr: The authors conducted an x-ray study on simple derivatives of ethane to analyze their crystal structures and molecular symmetries. They discovered that the molecules possess a real plane of symmetry and a pseudo-center of symmetry, which affects the reflection patterns observed in the x-ray diffraction experiments. The study provides valuable information about the arrangement of atoms and the unit cell parameters of these compounds.
