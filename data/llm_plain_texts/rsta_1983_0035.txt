tldr: This article discusses the physical properties and intermolecular interactions of thermotropic liquid crystals, focusing on the influence of short-range antiparallel dipole correlation in mesogenic compounds with strong terminal dipole moments. The author presents evidence from dielectric studies and explains the sometimes unexpected phase behavior and physical properties of these substances using a qualitative monomer-dimer equilibrium model.
