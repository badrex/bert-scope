tldr: Mr. Leewenhoeck conducted a series of experiments to study the structure and function of the optic nerve. He observed that the nerve's fibers shrink after being cut from the eye, revealing a hollow center. By drying and examining the optic nerve, he discovered numerous holes resembling a leather sieve. Leewenhoeck concluded that the nerve's fibers are made up of soft fluid globules, which are exhaled during drying. He proposed a model for how the optic nerve transmits visual information to the brain, similar to water in a glass being disturbed by a finger.
