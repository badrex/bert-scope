tldr: 'This study investigates the hydrodynamic forces on submerged oscillating cylinders at forward speed using linearized potential theory. The authors develop a numerical method that combines a finite-element approximation of the velocity potential near the cylinder with a boundary integral equation representation of the outer region. The results show excellent agreement with analytical solutions and reveal the influence of forward speed on the hydrodynamic forces acting on the submerged cylinder.'
