tldr: The authors conducted an investigation of collisions between alpha-particles and fluorine nuclei using an expansion chamber. They established the range-velocity relation for carbon recoil atoms and found that conservation of kinetic energy and momentum holds in these collisions. The study did not provide any positive information about inelastic (disintegration) collisions, which are known to occur.
