tldr: 'The author investigates the effects of evaporation and precipitation on ocean currents in a hypothetical ocean bounded by shores extending from pole to pole along meridians. The study shows that these processes can produce currents similar to those observed in the Earth's oceans, with clockwise circulation in the Northern Hemisphere and a notable current along the western boundary, resembling the Gulf Stream.'
