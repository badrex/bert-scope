tldr: The author presents a new method for demonstrating Euclidean geometry propositions, focusing on the 32nd, 47th, and 16th propositions of the first, third, and sixth books, respectively. The method involves using simple figures and mathematical definitions to prove the properties of angles, circles, triangles, proportions, and solids. This approach also applies to algebraic problems and provides a clearer understanding of mathematical concepts.
