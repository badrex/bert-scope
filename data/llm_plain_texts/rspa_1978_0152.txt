tldr: This article examines the meteorological aspects of the 1975-76 drought in England and Wales, exploring various factors that contributed to the drought, including unusual coldness in the North Pacific ocean, stronger upper winds in the Central Pacific, and the quasi-biennial oscillation. The author also discusses feedback mechanisms involving Atlantic sea temperatures and the drought's impact on rainfall. The study concludes that the drought appears to be a rare event rather than a symptom of climatic change.
