tldr: The authors studied the distribution of oxydases in plants and their role in pigment formation, particularly in flowers. They discovered two types of peroxydases in plants, epidermal and bundle peroxydases, which play a role in the formation of flower color. The research also sheds light on the phenomenon of dominant whites and ever-sporting strains in flowers, which are characterized by the sporadic appearance of color patches on a white or self-colored ground.
