tldr: The author conducted experiments to measure Poisson's ratio, a measure of the ratio of transverse strain to axial strain in materials. They used two instruments to measure the cross contraction of test pieces while subjected to a longitudinal pull. The results showed that Poisson's ratio varied for different materials, such as cast iron and copper. This research helped to improve the understanding of material properties and their behavior under stress.
