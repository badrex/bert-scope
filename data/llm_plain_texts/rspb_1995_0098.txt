tldr: The authors conducted a study comparing parasitism rates in unisexual and bisexual geckos. They found that unisexual geckos, which have maximally heterozygous genotypes, were more resistant to parasitism than bisexual geckos. This supports the idea that unisexual species can have increased fitness due to their resistance to parasites, which can help them survive and evolve in their environment.
