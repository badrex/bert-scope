tldr: The author discovered a new chromic oxalate salt, potassio-calcium chromic oxalate, with unique optical properties. The salt exhibits pleochroism, meaning it can transmit different colors of light depending on the angle of observation. The author also found that the salt is a powerful polarizer, with blue rays being more completely polarized than green rays. This discovery has implications for understanding the optical properties of minerals and the development of new materials.
