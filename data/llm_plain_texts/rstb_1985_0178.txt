tldr: The article discusses the process of neurogenesis in insects, focusing on the development of the grasshopper central nervous system. It explains how 150 neurogenic ectodermal cells give rise to a stereotyped pattern of 30 identified neuroblasts, which then generate a chain of ganglion mother cells and ultimately produce pairs of sibling neurons. The study highlights the role of cell interactions and cell lineage in generating neuronal diversity and specificity during insect neurogenesis.
