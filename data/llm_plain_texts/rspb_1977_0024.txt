tldr: The study demonstrates the anatomical representation of the vertical and horizontal meridians in areas V2 and V3 of the rhesus monkey visual cortex. The researchers used a double-labeling technique to identify the representation of both the vertical and horizontal meridians. The findings show that the lower visual field representation in V2 is a mirror image of its representation in V1, and the lower visual field representation in V3 is a mirror image of its representation in V2. This study provides a better understanding of the organization of the visual fields in the monkey brain.
