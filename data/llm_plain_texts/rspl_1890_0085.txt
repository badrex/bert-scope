tldr: The author discusses the bridge method for measuring periodic electric currents and its sensitivity. They explore ways to improve sensitivity by adjusting resistance and inductance in the circuit, considering factors like electromagnets, condensers, and the number of windings. The author also compares the effects of resistance and inductance on the bridge's performance.
