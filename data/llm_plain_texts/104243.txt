tldr: The author, Granvile Wheler, conducted experiments on electrical circular motion using Stephen Gray's method. He discovered that human motion and posture can significantly impact the direction and regularity of the circular motion. Wheler also found that wetting the thread and ball improved the experiment's success, and he observed oscillatory and convulsive motions during the experiment.
