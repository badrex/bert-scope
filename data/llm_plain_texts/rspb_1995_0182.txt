tldr: The authors critique a study by Godin and Davis, claiming that their experimental evidence for a predator pursuit deterrence function of predator inspection in guppies is flawed and correlational. They argue that the methods used in the study are problematic and do not provide clear evidence for the predator-deterrence hypothesis of predator inspection.
