tldr: The author presents a new theory for calculating strains in beams, focusing on the weight of the beam and its load. The theory considers the effects of compression and tension forces on the beam's interior and provides a method for solving differential equations to determine the strain on each point within the beam. This theory can be applied to various engineering applications and helps in understanding the forces acting on beams and their structures.
