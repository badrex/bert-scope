tldr: The author examines the structure and development of the Cysticercus cellulosae, a type of parasitic cyst found in pigs. The cysticercus consists of a cyst with a hollow neck containing calcareous bodies and hooklets. The cysticercus develops from a fusiform collection of cells that penetrate between muscular fibers using cilia-like processes. The author also describes the growth and development of the cysticercus, including the formation of suctorial disks, hooklets, and laminated bodies.
