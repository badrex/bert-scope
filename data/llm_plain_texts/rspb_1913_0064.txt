tldr: The authors conducted experiments using a calorimeter to measure the heat production associated with muscular work. They studied the effects of various sources of heat, such as incandescent lamps, electromagnets, and a fan, to improve the accuracy of their measurements. The results provided a better understanding of the energy transformation and heat production during physical activity.
