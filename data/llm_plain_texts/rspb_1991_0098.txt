tldr: The study investigates steady-state currents through voltage-dependent calcium channels in GH3 pituitary cells using the nystatin-modification of the patch-clamp technique. The results show that these currents are dihydropyridine-sensitive and play a role in the generation of action potentials in pituitary cells. This research provides evidence for the importance of calcium channels in the electrical activity of these cells.
