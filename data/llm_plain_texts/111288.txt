tldr: The author, John Tomes, discovered that dentinal tubes in teeth contain fibrils of soft tissue, which play a crucial role in the sensitivity of teeth. These fibrils connect the dental pulp to the dentine, allowing the tooth to feel pain or sensitivity when exposed to foreign objects or disease. The presence and integrity of these fibrils are necessary for the normal functioning of teeth.
