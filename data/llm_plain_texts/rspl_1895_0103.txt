tldr: This article investigates the gas obtained from uraninite and conducts experiments to determine its composition. The author, J. Norman Lockyer, examines the behavior of the gas under different conditions and compares it to solar and stellar results. The findings support the idea that the component giving rise to the D3 spectral line is lighter than the one producing the line at 5015.7, contradicting previous research by Runge and Paschen.
