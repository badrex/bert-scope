tldr: This article presents a method to determine the air density and scale height of the upper atmosphere using satellite observations. The authors calculate the changes in air density and orbital elements for six different satellites and discuss the effects of oblateness and temperature variations on the atmosphere. They also analyze the data from various satellites, including Sputnik 1 and Explorer 1, to study the variation of air density with height.
