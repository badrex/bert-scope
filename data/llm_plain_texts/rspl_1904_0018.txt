tldr: The authors conducted experiments with different methods of culturing fungi to study their infection mechanisms. They discovered that the restricted powers of infection, characteristic of "biologic forms," can break down when the vitality of the host-leaf is interfered with. This research suggests that injuries to leaves, caused by natural factors, may render the injured leaf susceptible to a fungus otherwise unable to infect it. The authors also explored the concept of chemotaxis in fungal infection, showing that certain substances in plant cell-sap can attract or repel fungal germ-tubes.
