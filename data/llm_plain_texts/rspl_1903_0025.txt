tldr: The authors investigated the optical activity of thymus-nucleic acid and found that it is dextrorotatory. They also discovered that the optical activity is influenced by the acidity or alkalinity of the solution. The addition of acids or alkalies can change the optical activity, but the original activity can be restored by adding an acid or an alkali, respectively.
