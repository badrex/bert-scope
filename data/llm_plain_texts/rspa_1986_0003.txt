tldr: This article presents an analysis of the steady free convection flow around a vertical flat plate embedded in a saturated porous medium. The authors obtain similarity solutions for a class of problems where the wall temperature varies as a power of the distance from the plate's leading edge. They also investigate the temporal development of the flow when the plate's temperature is impulsively increased and provide a numerical solution that matches the small and large time solutions. The study has applications in geophysical and engineering contexts, such as estimating the rate of cooling of vertical intrusions in aquifers and heat loss from underground energy transport and storage systems.
