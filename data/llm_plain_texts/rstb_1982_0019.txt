tldr: The article discusses the role of nitrification in forested ecosystems and the factors that regulate nitrate production. Nitrification, the microbial oxidation of ammonium, plays a crucial role in the nitrogen cycle in these ecosystems. Factors such as soil moisture, temperature, C:N ratio, pH, allelochemicals, and nutrient supply can affect nitrate production. The author suggests using relative nitrification as a measure to evaluate the importance of these factors in situ and make cross-system comparisons.
