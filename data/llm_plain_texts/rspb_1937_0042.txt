tldr: This study investigates the effects of pituitary gland removal on gastric secretion and blood flow in animals. The results show that the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland plays a role in regulating gastric secretion. The experiments reveal alterations in the relationship between gastric secretion and blood flow in hypophysectomized animals compared to normal animals. The findings suggest that the pituitary gland's influence on the digestive system is more complex than previously thought.
