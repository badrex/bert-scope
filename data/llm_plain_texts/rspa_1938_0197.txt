revised_title: Hamilton-Jacobi Theory and Quantization of a Dynamical Continuum

tldr: The authors extend the Hamilton-Jacobi theory to a dynamical continuum, leading to the quantization of the system. They demonstrate that the classical laws of a continuum, expressed in terms of Poisson brackets, have the same form as the quantum laws. This approach allows for a consistent method of quantization for both point dynamics and continuum dynamics.
