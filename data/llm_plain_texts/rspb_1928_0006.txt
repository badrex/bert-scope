tldr: The authors conducted experiments to analyze the effects of individual ions in three-salt solutions on the growth of potato plants. They found that potassium, calcium, and magnesium ions positively affected growth, while sulfate and phosphate ions had little to no effect, and nitrate ions had a positive effect. This study provides valuable insights into understanding the complex interactions of nutrients in plant growth.
