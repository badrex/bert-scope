tldr: The authors present a new method for calculating surface tension from measurements of pendant drops, improving upon previous methods. They use mathematical equations and numerical integration to calculate surface tension, providing accurate results for a range of values. This method offers a reliable alternative to traditional capillary elevation methods, but requires stringent control over experimental techniques.
