tldr: In this article, Fr. Hauksbee describes his experiments with different types of sulphur to produce light and electricity. He found that common sulphur produced a stronger and more vibrant light than flowers of sulphur. The light was visible both inside and outside the glass globe, and its strength was influenced by the thickness of the sulphur lining. Hauksbee also observed that the properties of the light and electricity could be affected by the preparation and management of the sulphur.
