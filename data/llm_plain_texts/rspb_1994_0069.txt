tldr: The author investigates how low levels of immigration between chaotic populations can reduce system extinctions by inducing asynchronous regular cycles. They find that populations in a weakly linked system often exhibit simple cycles or remain at a stable level, with a reduced probability of falling to low population levels. This effect allows for recolonization following the extinction of a subset of the populations, making it more difficult for all populations to go extinct.
