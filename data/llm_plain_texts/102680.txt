tldr: The author provides a detailed account of the dissection of John Bayles, a man who was reputed to be 130 years old. The dissection reveals the physical condition of an elderly person, including the emaciated state of the body, the distended stomach, and the hardness of the aorta. The author discusses the possible causes of Bayles' death, such as the weakness of the stomach and the loss of elasticity in the aorta. The author also compares Bayles' condition to that of old Parre, as described by the famous Harvey, and draws conclusions about the effects of aging on the human body.
