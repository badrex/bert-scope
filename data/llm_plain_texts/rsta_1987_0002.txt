tldr: This article discusses the tectonic settings of regional metamorphism in rift zones and the implications for lithospheric heating. The authors propose that dynamic topography, caused by horizontal extension and varying lithosphere thickness, contributes to flanking uplifts and central subsidence in rift zones. This may reduce the amount of heating required to explain uplift and subsidence in rifts.
