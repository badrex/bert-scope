tldr: The author, Fr. Hauskbee, conducted an experiment to determine the angle required to suspend a drop of oil of oranges between two glass planes. He found that the angle increased as the distance from the axis increased, and the drop's shape changed from round to oblong as it ascended. The experiment demonstrated the principles of surface tension and capillary action.
