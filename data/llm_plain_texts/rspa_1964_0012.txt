tldr: The authors conducted flame photometric studies on reactions induced by nitric oxide in hydrogen-oxygen-nitrogen flames. They discovered that nitric oxide acts as an effective catalyst for the recombination of atomic hydrogen and hydroxyl radicals in fuel-rich flames. The study found that nitroxyl (HNO) is the most probable intermediate in the catalysis process.
