tldr: This study investigates the transition from laminar to turbulent jet diffusion flames using a flame surface model with infinite chemical reaction rate and unit Lewis number. The time-dependent compressible Navier-Stokes equation is solved numerically, considering the temperature dependence of viscosity and diffusion coefficients. The results show that the radial distributions of density and transport coefficients play a dominant role in the transition mechanism, with the increase in diffusion coefficient having the most significant effect.
