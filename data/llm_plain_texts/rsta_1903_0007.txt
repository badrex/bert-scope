tldr: The author investigates the stability of the pear-shaped figure of equilibrium in a rotating mass of liquid. They use ellipsoidal harmonics and mathematical analysis to determine the energy lost during the concentration process and find that the pear-shaped figure is stable. This study contributes to the understanding of fluid dynamics and celestial mechanics.
