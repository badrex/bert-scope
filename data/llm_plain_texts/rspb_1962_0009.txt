tldr: Researchers isolated and synthesized queen substance, a honeybee pheromone, which inhibits queen rearing and worker bee ovary development. The substance has been identified as 9-oxodec-trans-2-enoic acid, and its biological activity has been confirmed through various tests. This discovery sheds light on the complex mechanisms of honeybee colony organization and the role of pheromones in regulating insect behavior.
