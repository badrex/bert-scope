tldr: Joule's experiments investigated the relationship between the induction of magnetism in iron bars and the electrical currents passing through them. He found that the magnetism induced in the bars was nearly proportional to the square of the diameter and the length of the wire and the intensity of the current. Joule's work contributed to the understanding of electromagnetic induction and laid the foundation for future research in this field.
