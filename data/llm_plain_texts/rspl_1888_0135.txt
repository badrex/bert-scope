tldr: The author discusses the effects of clamping the descending aorta on the heart's function and concludes that the observed effects are due to properties of the heart itself rather than extra-cardiac nerves. The study uses tracings of auricles and ventricles to analyze the heart's movements and contraction during the experiment.
