tldr: The authors investigate the mechanism of the enzyme catalase in breaking down hydrogen peroxide. They demonstrate that catalase reduces the iron in its structure, which is essential for its catalytic activity. The decomposition of hydrogen peroxide is achieved through a reversible reduction process, where the catalase iron is reduced by hydrogen peroxide and then reoxidized by molecular oxygen. This process is inhibited when oxygen levels are low, suggesting that molecular oxygen is necessary for the reaction to occur.
