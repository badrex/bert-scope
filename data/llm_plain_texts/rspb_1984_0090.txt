tldr: The study investigates the retinal visual fields and a schematic eye model for the Humboldt penguin, Spheniscus humboldti. The findings suggest that the penguin's eye is aquatic in design, being emmetropic in water and myopic in air. The research also reveals that the penguin lacks binocular vision, which is an unexpected property for an animal that feeds underwater and whose predators typically attack from below the water surface.
