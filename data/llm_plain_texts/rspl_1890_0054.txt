tldr: This article investigates the chemical reactions between nitric acid and certain metals, such as copper, mercury, and bismuth. The authors found that the presence of nitrous acid affects the dissolution of these metals in nitric acid. They also discovered that the amount of metal dissolved and the amount of nitrous acid present are related variables when the nitric acid is in excess. The study provides insights into the chemical changes and reactions that occur during these processes.
