tldr: This study develops a theory of food chain lengths in large community food webs using a mathematical model called the cascade model. The authors analyze the behavior of chain lengths in webs with a large number of species and derive a theoretical mean and variance of the length of chains. They also find that the mean length of chains in large webs is approximately equal to the mean number of predators and prey of any species in the web. This analysis provides a quantitative explanation for why the longest chains are very short compared to the number of species in a web, even when the number of species is very large.
