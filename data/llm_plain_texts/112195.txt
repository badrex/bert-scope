tldr: The author examines the conditions and geological age of drift deposits containing the remains of extinct mammals and flint-implements. They argue that these deposits were formed through long-term river action and are not the result of a cataclysm or a sudden excavation of valleys. The author also discusses the structure and origin of these deposits in various river valleys in England and France.
