tldr: The author describes a method to create an active modification of nitrogen through an electric discharge and its chemical reactions. The nitrogen is purified using phosphorus, and the author investigates the effects of impurities, such as oxygen and hydrogen, on the active nitrogen. The chemical reactions of active nitrogen with various metals, such as mercury, zinc, and cadmium, are explored, resulting in the formation of nitrides. The author also studies the reaction of active nitrogen with carbon disulfide, iodine, and other substances.
