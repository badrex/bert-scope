tldr: This article investigates the kinetics of gaseous oxidation reactions involving methane, methyl alcohol, and formaldehyde. The authors found that these reactions possess a complex chain mechanism, with the rate of reaction being highly influenced by the concentration of the hydrocarbon and the surface area of the reaction vessel. The findings suggest that the propagation of chains is more dependent on the energy available than the exact chemical configuration of the molecules.
