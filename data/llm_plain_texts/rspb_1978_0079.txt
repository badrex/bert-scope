tldr: The authors analyzed the ribosomal ribonucleic acids (rRNA) of Cyanophora paradoxa and its endosymbiotic cyanelles, Cyanocyta korschikoffiana. They discovered four species of rRNA in the host, with two species specific to the cyanelles. The lability of the 23S rRNA from the cyanelles and its degradation patterns suggest a possible connection to the endosymbiotic theory of cellular evolution.
