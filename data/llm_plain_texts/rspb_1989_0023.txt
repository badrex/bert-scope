tldr: The article investigates the development of chemical and electrical synapses in pairs of identified leech neurons in culture. The study shows that the tip of a neuron represents a preferential site for the formation of chemical synapses, with chemical transmission establishing more rapidly and reliably when cells are plated in culture with their stumps touching. The main emphasis is on the mixed chemical-electrical synapse that forms between Retzius cells.
