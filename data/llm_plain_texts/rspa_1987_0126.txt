tldr: The authors introduce a new set of transformed composition variables for representing reactive-phase diagrams, which are more convenient than mole fractions. These variables help in defining non-reactive limits, making equilibrium surfaces tangent at azeotropic states, and simplifying the material-balance equations for reactive mixtures.
