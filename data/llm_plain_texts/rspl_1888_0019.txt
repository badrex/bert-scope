tldr: The author examined the photographic capacities of two silver on glass mirrors with different focal lengths. They found that mirrors with longer focal lengths provided better image quality and were more suitable for astronomical photography. The study also highlighted the challenges faced in maintaining steady motion and exposure times for accurate imaging.
