tldr: This article investigates the finite-amplitude behavior of non-isothermal flow instabilities in a vertical annulus. The authors find that the instability is supercritical and that the velocity waves exchange energy with the thermal field at the same wavelength and in the direction of the body force. The theoretical predictions of Nusselt numbers and friction coefficients agree well with experimental results.
