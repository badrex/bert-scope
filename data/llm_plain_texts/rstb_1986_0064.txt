revised_title: Hormonal and Developmental Control of Gene Expression in Wheat: Insights from Aleurone Cells

tldr: This article investigates the hormonal and developmental control of gene expression in wheat, focusing on aleurone cells. The authors found that gibberellic acid triggers the expression of many genes in aleurone cells, and they discuss the mechanisms involved in coordinate regulation of gene expression. They also explore the expression of hydrolase genes in non-aleurone cells, which requires different regulatory strategies.
