tldr: The article investigates the coupling of m2 and m4 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes to Ca2+-dependent K+ channels in transformed NL308 neuroblastoma x fibroblast hybrid cells. The results suggest that m2 and m4 receptors activate a Ca2+-dependent K+ current through a PTX-sensitive G-protein, while m1 and m3 receptors activate a similar process through a different, PTX-insensitive G-protein.
