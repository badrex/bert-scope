tldr: The author presents a method for calculating stress in frameworks using systematic relaxation of constraints. The method is applicable to three-dimensional frameworks with rigid and frictionless joints, and accounts for torsional and flexural rigidity. The author derives formulae for applying the relaxation method to various types of problems and provides an example of a two-dimensional framework to illustrate the process.
