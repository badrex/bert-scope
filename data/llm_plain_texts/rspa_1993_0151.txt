tldr: This article presents the development of a Fourier integral representation of the Green function for an anisotropic elastic half-space. The author derives the representation, which is composed of two terms: the Green function for an infinite anisotropic medium and a term accounting for the effect of the traction-free surface. The author also applies the Fourier integral representation to determine the exact displacement caused by a two-dimensional periodic vertical force distribution in a half-space with cubic material symmetry.
