tldr: 'The article discusses the damage caused to living cells and tissues by freezing, focusing on the denaturation of lipid-protein complexes. The authors explain that freezing causes changes in the physical environment, such as increased ionic strength and pH changes, which can damage lipid-protein complexes. They provide examples of how different lipid-protein complexes respond to freezing and suggest that the removal of water during freezing may be a significant factor in the damage caused to these complexes.'
