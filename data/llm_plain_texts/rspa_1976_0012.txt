revised_title: 'Reevaluation of the Momentum of Light in a Refracting Medium'

tldr: The author examines the momentum of light in a refracting medium, challenging the results of Minkowski and Abraham. They find that neither answer gives the total momentum density and that both relate to physically interesting quantities. The correct answer for a broad wave in a uniform medium is given by a specific formula, and for weak refraction, it is approximately equal to the average of the Abraham and Minkowski results.
