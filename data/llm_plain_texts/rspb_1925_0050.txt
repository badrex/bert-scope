tldr: This study investigates the inhibitory effect of blood serum on hemolysis using saponin and sodium taurocholate as hemolytic agents. The results show that two samples of human serum can produce different inhibitory effects, even when present in the same amount. The research also demonstrates that the reaction between serum and saponin or sodium taurocholate is not significantly influenced by temperature within the experimental range.
