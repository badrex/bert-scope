tldr: The authors conducted experiments with ionium and radiothorium to study the excitation of beta rays by alpha rays. They discovered that beta rays are emitted from ionium and radiothorium, and the amount of beta radiation is very small compared to the amount of alpha radiation. The results suggest that beta rays are excited by alpha rays, either from the ionium itself or from surrounding thorium atoms. The absorption of each type of radiation was studied, and the absorption curves were obtained.
