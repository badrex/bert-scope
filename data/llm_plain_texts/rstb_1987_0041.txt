tldr: This article investigates the molecular, cellular, and physiological effects of oil-derived hydrocarbons on marine molluscs and their use in impact assessment. It explores various biological effects measurements used in developing early-warning systems for reactions to hydrocarbon-induced damage. The study focuses on the use of marine molluscs as sentinel organisms for assessing pollutant effects and linking the responses at different levels of biological organization to strengthen their use in impact assessment.
