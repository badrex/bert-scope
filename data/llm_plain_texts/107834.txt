tldr: The author presents a new method for measuring the resistance of fluids to bodies passing through them, focusing on overcoming errors and inaccuracies in previous experiments. The new method involves using a spring weighing-machine and a specific setup to measure resistance at different velocities, providing more accurate results for understanding fluid dynamics and navigation.
