tldr: The article discusses the genetical activity of heterochromatin, which is found in chromosomes that are not essential for normal growth and survival. Heterochromatin has properties similar to polygenic combinations, carrying non-essential genes that balance the effects of essential genes in the regular chromosomes. This balance is achieved through intrachromosome adjustment, making heterochromatin an essential part of an adaptively adjusted individual.
