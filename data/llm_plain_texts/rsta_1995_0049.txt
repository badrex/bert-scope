tldr: This article discusses the development of multiphase intermetallic materials for high-temperature structural applications, focusing on ordered compounds like nickel, titanium, iron, and niobium aluminides. The research aims to improve the strength, ductility, and creep resistance of these materials for use in jet engines and other high-temperature environments. The article highlights the potential of multiphase alloys to overcome the brittleness of single-phase intermetallics and presents advances in nickel aluminides and iron aluminides as promising materials for high-temperature applications.
