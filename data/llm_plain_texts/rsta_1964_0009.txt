tldr: The authors measured the diamagnetic anisotropies of various organic molecules, including aromatic and aliphatic compounds, and determined the principal molecular susceptibilities. The study found that the molecular anisotropy is related to the molecular shape, constitution, and bond character. In aromatic compounds, the anisotropy is influenced by substitution, which generally decreases the anisotropy. This decrease depends on the nature and position of the substituents.
