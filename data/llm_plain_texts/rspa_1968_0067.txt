tldr: The authors studied the ferromagnetic domain structure of haematite crystals, observing changes in the domain structure and remanent magnetization as the temperature approached the low-temperature transition. They found that the domain walls on synthetic crystals disappeared at temperatures below about -12°C, while natural crystals showed domain walls at all temperatures down to -40°C. The study provides insights into the behavior of haematite's domain structure and its magnetic properties.
