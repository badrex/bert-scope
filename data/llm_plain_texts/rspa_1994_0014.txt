tldr: The authors present a method to obtain closed-form elastic fields due to inclusions in transversely isotropic solids. They introduce a new stress vector function, the hexagonal stress vector, and use Green's functions for double forces and double forces with moment to solve the inclusion problem. The elastic field inside the inclusion is expressed in terms of newtonian and biharmonic potential functions, while two more harmonic potential functions are introduced for the solution outside the inclusion.
