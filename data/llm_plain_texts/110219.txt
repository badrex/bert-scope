tldr: The author, James Horsburgh, discusses the observation of icebergs in unusually low latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere. He suggests that these icebergs may have originated from a large tract of land near the Antarctic Circle, carried by prevailing currents, winds, and waves. The author also speculates that the recent increase in icebergs could be due to a rare event, such as an earthquake or volcano, disrupting ice masses in the inaccessible regions of the south.
