tldr: The author describes a method for gilding gold onto silver by using a duck feather, aqua regia, and spittle. The process involves dissolving the feather in aqua regia, drying it, and repeating until all the liquid is absorbed. The feather is then burned to create a tinder, which is used to rub the gold onto the silver surface. This method is known to only a few goldsmiths in Germany.
