tldr: John Knox observed new color phenomena in thin plates of glass and investigated the effects of different surfaces and angles on these phenomena. He discovered various fringes and rings of colors caused by the interaction of light with the surfaces of the plates. Knox also found that the presence of air or other fluids had little effect on these phenomena, and he proposed that the cause of these effects was the interference of reflecting and refracting layers in the plates.
