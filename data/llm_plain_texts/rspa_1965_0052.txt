tldr: The authors use the Wiener-Hopf technique and the generalized factorial function to solve a mixed boundary value problem of plate flexure in the form of an infinite strip. They find the deflection by evaluating a Fourier integral and obtain the deflection at various points using eigenfunction expansions. The study provides a rigorous solution to the problem, considering the change in boundary conditions and the nature of the singularity.
