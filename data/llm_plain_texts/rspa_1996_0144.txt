tldr: This article investigates double-impact periodic solutions in periodically forced impact oscillators, focusing on the Duffing oscillator. The authors analyze the behavior of these solutions, including non-physical and unstable orbits, and explore the existence and stability of double-impact orbits for odd values of the forcing frequency. The study also examines the impact of varying parameters and presents numerical calculations for more general cases of impacting systems.
