tldr: 'In this study, researchers investigated male mating preferences in the Majorcan midwife toad. Contrary to their predictions, males did not prefer low-frequency calls, suggesting stabilizing selection on call frequency and directional selection on call intensity. The results indicate that male midwife toads may base their mating decisions on factors other than call frequency, such as call intensity and female size.'
