tldr: The article discusses electron spectroscopy of surfaces using de-excitation of metastable noble gas atoms. The technique is highly surface-sensitive and provides information on the valence electronic properties of surfaces without interference from bulk contributions. The two main de-excitation mechanisms, Auger de-excitation and resonance ionization followed by Auger neutralization, are explained, and examples of their applications are provided.
