tldr: The article describes various techniques for using multi-wavelength anomalous scattering data to determine protein structures. The authors explore different methods, including Patterson-like functions and analytical methods like AGREE and ROTATE, and discuss the importance of data consistency and preprocessing with the REVISE procedure. These techniques were applied to the core streptavidin data, demonstrating their effectiveness in solving protein structures.
