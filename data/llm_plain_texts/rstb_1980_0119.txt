tldr: This article discusses the study of elementary excitations in liquid helium using neutron scattering techniques. The authors explore the density and spin fluctuations in liquid helium and compare their findings with theoretical predictions. The results show that the density fluctuation spectrum can be explained using the Random Phase Approximation (RPA) theory, while the spin fluctuation spectrum aligns with the paramagnon model, suggesting that the nuclear spin system in liquid helium is close to ferromagnetic.
