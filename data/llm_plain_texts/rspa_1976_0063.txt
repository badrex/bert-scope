tldr: The authors propose the use of ellipsoidal harmonics to expand the electrostatic potential and isotropic magnetic shielding outside non-spherical molecules. This method improves the representation of the external molecular potential and provides a better level of accuracy for a given number of harmonic terms compared to conventional multipolar expansions. The ellipsoidal harmonics can be used for potential problems in molecular physics, even for inhomogeneous and irregularly shaped molecules.
