tldr: The author conducted experiments to induce melanism and albinism in the geometrid moth Selenia bilunari. They discovered that melanism could be induced through a specific diet and that albinism occurred when the larvae were fed a different type of food. The author also observed that the induced traits were inherited, but could not fully confirm the mode of inheritance due to the loss of some critical broods.
