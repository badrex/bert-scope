tldr: This article presents a complete solution to the two-dimensional hydrodynamical problem of a cylinder's motion in an incompressible and inviscid fluid. The authors determine the fluid's potential and stream function, as well as the energy and forces exerted by the liquid on the cylinder. They use the Lagrange-Kirchhoff method and Blasius contour integral expressions to calculate these forces, considering the effect of variable circulation. The discussion of surfaces of discontinuity is postponed for a future note.
