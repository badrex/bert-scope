tldr: This article investigates the effects of compressive stress on the magnetic qualities of nickel. The author, J. A. Ewing, and his students, Mr. W. Low and Mr. D. Low, found that compressive stress significantly increases the magnetic susceptibility and retentiveness of nickel. This discovery highlights the importance of understanding the relationship between stress and the magnetic properties of materials.
