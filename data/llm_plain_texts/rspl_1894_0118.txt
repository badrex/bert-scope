tldr: The author examines the structure and affinities of Heliopora cerulea, a type of colonial coral, and compares it to the structures of Xenia and Heteroxenia. They describe the coenenchymal coeca, the corallum structure, and the presence of an ectodermic skeleton in these organisms. The author also proposes the classification of Heliopora and its allies as Cainothecalia, distinguishing them from Autothecalia forms like Syringolites, Favositidae, and others.
