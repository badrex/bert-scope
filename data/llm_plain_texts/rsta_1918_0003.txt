tldr: The author investigates the origin and development of pleochroic haloes, which are formed by radioactive elements like uranium and thorium. They discover that the same course of development occurs for both types of haloes and explain the observed structural features of haloes by introducing the concept of "reversal" or "solarisation." The author also discusses the methods used for measuring haloes and the ionizing effects of alpha rays.
