tldr: The authors present two different Lagrangian formulations for localized buckling in a strut on a nonlinear softening foundation. They compare a 'fast space' Lagrangian with a'slow space' Lagrangian, which incorporates both periodic and localized responses. The study provides a deeper understanding of the complexities of localized buckling and its implications for practical applications such as pipeline and railway track design.
