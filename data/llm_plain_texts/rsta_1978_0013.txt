tldr: This article discusses the phenomenon of geological faults and their role in crustal deformation. It reviews the various physical processes of faulting and the limitations of Anderson's fault classification. The author highlights the importance of understanding fault mechanics for effective earthquake prediction and emphasizes the need for further study of complex fault systems.
