tldr: This article presents an accurate method for measuring the thermal conductivity of metals, specifically tin, at low temperatures. The authors analyze experimental curves for tin specimens with different crystal structures and impurity contents in both superconducting and normal states. They find that at low temperatures, the conductivity is mainly due to the lattice, and the electronic contribution to the thermal conduction in the superconducting state falls very rapidly. The effects of magnetic fields on thermal conductivity measurements are also discussed.
