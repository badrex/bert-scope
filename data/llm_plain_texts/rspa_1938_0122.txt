tldr: The authors conducted an X-ray diffraction study to determine the structure of a new form of resorcinol. They found that the molecules in this form have a more compact and parallel arrangement compared to the original resorcinol. The transformation from the original form to this new form involves several factors and causes deformation of the resorcinol molecule. This research provides insights into intermolecular bonding in hydroxy compounds.
