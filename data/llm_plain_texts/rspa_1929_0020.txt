tldr: This article investigates the compressibility and intermolecular forces in gaseous mixtures of helium and hydrogen. The authors found that the experimental coefficients represent a complex set of happenings, including encounters between like and unlike molecules. They also studied the influence of temperature on the constants of the isotherms and compared their results with other researchers' data. The study confirms that the intermolecular forces in helium and hydrogen are symmetric around each molecule.
