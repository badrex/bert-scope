tldr: This article investigates the dynamics of charged liquid drops near the Rayleigh limit, where the drop's net electrical charge exceeds the stability threshold. The authors use a combination of domain perturbation and multiple timescale methods to compute the evolution of axisymmetric, inviscid oscillating drops and show that the Rayleigh limit corresponds to a transcritical bifurcation point between static spherical shapes and oblate and prolate axisymmetric forms. The study provides insights into the break-up dynamics of charged drops and the stability of their shapes.
