tldr: The author examines the brain structure of Ornithorhynchus paradoxus, a unique monotreme, and discovers that while it shares some mammalian features, it also has distinct characteristics. The study reveals that the brain lacks the corpus callosum and has a different pattern of commissures compared to other mammals, which could be due to its unique evolutionary history.
