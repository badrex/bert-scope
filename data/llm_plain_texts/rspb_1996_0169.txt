tldr: The study examines the functional significance of the cocoon in two arctic moth species, Gynaephora rossii and G. groenlandica. The experiments reveal that the pale cocoons of G. groenlandica accelerate pupal development, while the dark cocoon of G. rossii does not have a detectable effect. The warming effect of sunlight is the main factor influencing the enhanced development in G. groenlandica. The results provide evidence that cocoons can enhance a fitness correlate in insects.
