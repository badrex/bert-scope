tldr: 'This study investigates the refractivity of para-hydrogen, a modification of hydrogen discovered in 1929. The authors found that the refractivity of para-hydrogen, when adsorbed in charcoal at the temperature of liquid oxygen, does not differ significantly from that of ordinary hydrogen at room temperature. The experiments had a margin of error of about 3 parts in 14,000, indicating that any difference between the two types of hydrogen is minimal.'
