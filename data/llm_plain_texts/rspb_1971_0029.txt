tldr: The article discusses the development of standardized bioassay methods to measure the effects of pollution on aquatic organisms. These methods help determine allowable waste concentrations in the aquatic environment, ensuring water quality standards are met to protect aquatic life. The focus is on short-term and long-term bioassays, using various test organisms, and establishing uniform procedures for testing the effects of different pollutants.
