tldr: The authors analyzed the dendritic morphology and electrical properties of retinal ganglion cells in cats using passive cable theory and histological data. They found that different types of ganglion cells have distinct electrical properties, which are likely relevant to their physiological functions. The study suggests that specific branching patterns and synapse distribution may support complex information processing operations on incoming signals.
