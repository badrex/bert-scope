tldr: The article presents a general theorem on the analyticity of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a linear homogeneous second-order differential operator with respect to a parameter. The theorem is applicable to various categories of problems, including semiclassical problems and -matrix theory of scattering. The theorem is proven using the theorem on implicit functions of analytic variables and the concept of analyticity in the variable and boundary conditions.
