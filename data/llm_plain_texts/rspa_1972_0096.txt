tldr: The authors develop a novel approach to correlate the isothermal mechanical behavior of compressible rubberlike solids. They expand the strain-energy function to account for volume changes and compare predictions with experimental data. The study focuses on the strain-energy function for compressible rubber materials, considering the effects of volume changes and providing a better understanding of the mechanical response of these materials.
