tldr: This study presents determinations of the lunar atmospheric tide at twenty-seven stations worldwide, analyzing the amplitude and phase angle of the tide. The results show a notable reduction in the tide's amplitude on the western coast of the United States and a general decrease in amplitude with increasing latitude. The study also discusses the influence of the moon on atmospheric pressure and its potential impact on climate science.
