tldr: The author, Mr. Caswell, describes the invention of a new baroscope, a device for measuring atmospheric pressure. The baroscope is more accurate and cost-effective than previous models, and it works by measuring the depth of a water-filled bucket and the contraction of air within the instrument. The author also discusses the effects of wind and weather on the baroscope's readings.
