tldr: Researchers have developed a method to assign maternity in social wasps using microsatellite loci. This method allows for effective maternity assignment even when candidate mothers are related and fathers are unknown. The study focuses on the wasp species Polistes annularis and demonstrates the practical application of this method, revealing a high number of changes in reproductive dominance within the colonies.
