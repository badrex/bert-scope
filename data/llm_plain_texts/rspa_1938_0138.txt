tldr: Barrer and Rideal studied the sorption of polar and non-polar gases in zeolites. They found that zeolites selectively adsorb polar gases, while non-polar gases are less likely to be adsorbed. The study provides insights into the adsorption process and potential applications of zeolites in gas separation and purification.
