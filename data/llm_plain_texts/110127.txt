tldr: The author, Thomas Drummond, discusses the challenges of observing distant stations in geodetical operations, particularly in Ireland's hazy conditions. He proposes using the intense light emitted from heated quicklime to improve visibility. The light's intensity is found to be 83 times greater than an Argand burner's flame. Drummond successfully tests this method on Slieve Snaght, a hill in Northern Ireland, and suggests further applications for lighthouses.
