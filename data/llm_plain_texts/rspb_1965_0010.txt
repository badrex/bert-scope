tldr: Researchers discovered a new pigment produced by a Streptomycete, a nitrosophenol cobalt chelate, in a chemically defined medium. The pigment contains three molecules of the same ligand found in ferroverdin, bound to a cobalt ion. The chemical structure and properties of the cobalt chelate were analyzed and compared to ferroverdin, revealing a close chemical similarity.
