tldr: In 1900, a team of astronomers led by W. H. M. Christie and F. W. Dyson observed the total solar eclipse in Ovar, Portugal. They took photographs of the corona and the spectrum of the "flash" during the eclipse. The observations provided valuable data for understanding the structure and behavior of the corona, as well as the relationship between coronal streamers and solar prominences.
