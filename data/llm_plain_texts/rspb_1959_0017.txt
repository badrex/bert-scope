tldr: The author's study of the locust auditory ganglion using electron microscopy revealed the presence of collagen-like connective tissue fibrils. These fibrils have a similar macroperiod length to rat-tail collagen and show a series of bands in a polarized manner. The discovery of these fibrils in insect material could help explain the scarcity or absence of collagen fibers previously considered characteristic of the insect class.
