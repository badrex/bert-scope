tldr: The author, George Biddell Airy, presents corrections to the computed lengths of light waves published in the Philosophical Transactions of 1868. He uses a table of corrections to improve the accuracy of wave-lengths in the solar spectrum, specifically for spectral lines produced by the atmosphere and various metals. The author also discusses the lack of a mechanical explanation for the origin of these lines.
