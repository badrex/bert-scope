tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the second virial coefficient of benzene at low pressures using a microbalance method. They improved the accuracy of the method by compensating for adsorption and carefully controlling the experimental conditions. The results provide a more accurate understanding of the behavior of benzene vapor at low pressures.
