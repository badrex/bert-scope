tldr: The author investigates the effect of ozone on the nuclear activity of volatile oils in supersaturated Glauber's salt solutions. They find that ozone weakens the cohesive force of volatile oils, making them more effective nuclei for solidification. This discovery helps explain the varying results of previous experiments and sheds light on the role of ozone in the solidification process.
