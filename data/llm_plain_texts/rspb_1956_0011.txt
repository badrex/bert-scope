tldr: 'This study examines the formation and growth of collagen fibrils in avian tendons using electron microscopy. It shows that collagen fibrils are formed both inside and outside cells, and that they gradually enlarge and become orientated into extracellular bundles. Each individual fibril is surrounded by interfibrillar substance, which is crucial for the formation and growth of collagen fibrils. The research supports the idea that fibrogenic cells synthesize the necessary precursors of the collagen complex, which are then transformed by reaction with interstitial fluid.'
