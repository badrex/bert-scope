tldr: This article describes the fossil remains of the Equine family found in the Bruniquel Cave. The author compares these fossils with existing species of Equus and previously defined fossil species of Equidae. The study reveals that the fossils belong to a species or well-marked race within the true Horses, which were smaller than the average-sized horse of the present period. The author also discusses the evidence of the people who inhabited the cave and hunted these wild horses for food.
