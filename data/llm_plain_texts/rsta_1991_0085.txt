tldr: The Hinotori satellite observed over 700 solar flares, revealing that flares produce plasmas as hot as 10^7 K and have varying characteristics depending on the environment of the flaring regions. The satellite's hard-ray telescope and high dispersion soft-ray crystal spectrometer provided valuable insights into the location and behavior of high-energy particles during solar flares, leading to a better understanding of the solar atmosphere and the processes occurring within it.
