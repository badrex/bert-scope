tldr: The author, Charles Hatchett, conducted experiments on zoophytes, which are marine organisms that form a colony, such as corals and sponges. He discovered that their shells and bones are made of similar materials, primarily composed of carbonate of lime and a gelatinous substance. This research helped improve the understanding of the classification and formation of zoophytes.
