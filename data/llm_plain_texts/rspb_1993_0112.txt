tldr: Researchers have identified a new member of the pentraxin family in the frog species Xenopus laevis. This novel protein, called XL-PXN1, is a fusion of an amino-terminal peptide and a carboxy-terminal pentraxin. The discovery of this new pentraxin provides insights into the evolution and functions of pentraxins in vertebrates.
