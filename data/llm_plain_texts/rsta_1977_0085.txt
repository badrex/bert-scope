tldr: This article presents a new microprobing procedure to analyze the physical and chemical properties of extraterrestrial dust grains on a microscale. The authors apply this technique to study lunar weathering effects and infer the irradiation history of a 22Ne-rich fraction of the Orgueil meteorite. The research provides insights into space weathering processes and the composition of extraterrestrial materials.
