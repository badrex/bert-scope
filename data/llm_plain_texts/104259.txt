tldr: The author conducted experiments to test the ability to transmit electricity over long distances using a packthread string. They successfully transmitted electricity over 420 feet, attracting a thread of trial near the other end. The experiment was more successful when the string was wet, suggesting that moisture in the air may have played a role in the conductivity.
