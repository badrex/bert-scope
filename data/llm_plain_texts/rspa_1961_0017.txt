tldr: The authors present a method to calculate the friction and diffusion coefficients of the Fokker-Planck equation in a plasma. They consider the electric micro-field as a superposition of fields due to individual particles and use dielectrically screened potentials to evaluate the coefficients. The method is applicable when the distribution functions are independent of time and space, and the plasma is stable against growing electric oscillations.
