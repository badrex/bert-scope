tldr: The author, Martin Barry, presents evidence supporting his theory that animal and vegetable fibre is originally composed of twin spiral filaments. He explains how these filaments form the cell membrane and other structures, and how the nucleolus plays a crucial role in the process. Barry's observations were later confirmed by Agardh in 1852.
