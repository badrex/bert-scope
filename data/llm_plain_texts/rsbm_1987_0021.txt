tldr: 'David MacLeish Smith was a renowned engineer who made significant contributions to the design of steam turbines and rotor dynamics. He worked at Metropolitan Vickers and its successors, where he developed methods for calculating stresses and deflections in turbine diaphragms, designed high-stability journal bearings, and studied blade and rotor vibrations. His work on rotor dynamics and steam turbine design was groundbreaking and influenced the industry for decades.'
