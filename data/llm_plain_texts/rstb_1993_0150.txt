tldr: This article discusses the process of pre-mRNA splicing in plants, focusing on the components and mechanisms involved. The authors analyze intron sequences and structures, as well as the major components of the spliceosome, which play a crucial role in accurate intron removal and gene expression regulation in plants. The study highlights the differences between plant and animal introns and the importance of understanding plant splicing for transgenic plant production and gene expression regulation.
