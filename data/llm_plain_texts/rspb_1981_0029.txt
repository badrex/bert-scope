revised_title: 'Investigating Non-Quantal Transmitter Release in Motor Nerve Impulses'
semantic_tags:
  - Neurotransmitter release
  - Motor nerve impulses
  - Acetylcholine leakage
  - Averaging techniques
  - Calcium-deprived medium
tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine if motor nerve impulses evoke 'non-quantal' transmitter release. They used averaging techniques in frog and mammalian endplates in calcium-deprived medium but failed to observe any non-quantal endplate response. The limit of detection was always less than 10 pV, suggesting that the continuous leakage of acetylcholine from nerve endings may not be directly influenced by the membrane potential.
