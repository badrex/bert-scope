tldr: The author presents cytological evidence of genetic crossing-over in meiosis, specifically through the observation of chiasmata in tetrasomic hyacinths. Chiasmata are crucial for understanding chromosome behavior and the exchange of genetic material during meiosis. The author concludes that the assumption of "partial chiasmatypy," where crossing-over occurs between two of the four chromatids at every chiasma, is the most plausible working hypothesis for correlating cytological and genetical observations.
