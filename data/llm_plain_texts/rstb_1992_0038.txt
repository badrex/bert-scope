tldr: This article discusses the structure and mechanism of kinesin and myosin, two molecular motors that use ATP hydrolysis to drive movement in biological systems. Both enzymes have a dimeric structure with two heavy chains and three domains. The binding and hydrolysis of ATP are rapid, but the steady-state ATPase rate is limited by a slow step in the region of product release. Interaction with actin or microtubules accelerates the slow release of products. The article also explores the role of additional subunits in the regulation and modulation of these molecular motors.
