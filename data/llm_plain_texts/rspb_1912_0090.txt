tldr: The authors discovered a new species of gregarine, Steinina rotundata, in the mid-gut of bird-fleas of the genus Ceratophyllus. They found that the gregarine has a unique structure and life cycle, and it is different from other known gregarine species. The researchers also observed that the gregarine is not found in pairs, and it has a brief intra-cellular phase, which is difficult to identify due to the resemblance with other cells in the gut.
