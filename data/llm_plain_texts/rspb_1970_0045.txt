tldr: The author discusses gene action and control in the fungus Aspergillus nidulans, focusing on the mechanisms regulating gene activity. They explore the role of the nuclear membrane, the control of nitrate reduction, and the existence of nuclear permeases in Aspergillus. The study provides evidence for nuclear permeases and the localization of some control systems within the nucleus, while also highlighting differences in gene regulation compared to bacterial and viral systems.
