tldr: The authors analyze the stability of spiral flow between rotating cylinders, considering the effect of an axial pressure gradient. They use the narrow gap approximation, axisymmetric disturbances assumption, and the assumption of same-direction rotation to study the problem. The onset of instability depends on the Taylor number and axial Reynolds number. The study provides a comprehensive understanding of the stability boundary in the Taylor number plane and discusses the limitations of existing experimental data.
