tldr: The author, Everard Home, describes the fossil skeleton of the Proteo-Saurus, a prehistoric animal, and discusses the discovery and classification of its bones. He also corrects previous errors in understanding the skull's anatomy and notes the differences in size among various specimens. The author highlights the importance of the discovery of the animal's posterior and anterior feet and the fact that the bones found in the blue lias near Bath belong to the Proteo-Saurus, not the Crocodile.
