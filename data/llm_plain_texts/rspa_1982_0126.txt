tldr: This article investigates the folding process of inextensible sheets to create developable surfaces. The authors identify the geometric constraints and theorems associated with curved-line folding, which can be used to design sheet-metal products that use these surfaces. This expands the range of engineering products that can be made by folding and bending a single inextensible sheet.
