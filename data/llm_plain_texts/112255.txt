tldr: The Royal Society discussed the establishment of a powerful telescope in Melbourne, Australia, for observing southern nebulas and the progress of a manuscript catalogue of scientific memoirs published between 1800 and 1860. The telescope would be housed in the Melbourne Observatory, and the catalogue aimed to provide easy access to scientific titles for researchers.
