tldr: The authors apply the quantum theory of collisions to the motion of gas atoms using the rigid sphere model. They determine the range of validity of the classical theory of free paths, viscosity, and diffusion, and show how quantum mechanics improves the applicability of the model to the viscosity of helium. They also discuss the possibility of experimental proof of Bose-Einstein statistics through the study of scattering.
