tldr: The authors conducted an experiment to study the nuclear scattering of electrons and positrons at low energies using radioactive sources and anthracene crystals. They found that their results were in accordance with the predictions of the Dirac theory, with the experimental values of the electron-positron ratio being within the experimental accuracy of about 5%.
