tldr: The author investigates the distribution of oxydases in Cytisus Adami, a graft-hybrid plant, and its component species, Cytisus purpureus and Cytisus laburnum. The study confirms Baur's hypothesis that Cytisus Adami is a periclinal chimera, meaning it is a dual organism composed externally of one species and internally of another. The research also provides evidence that oxydases can migrate from one part of a plant to another, which may help explain the differences in flower forms between Cytisus Adami and its component species.
