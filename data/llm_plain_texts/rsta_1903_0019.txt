tldr: This article explores the concept of differential invariants of a surface and their geometric significance. The author defines differential invariants as functions that remain unchanged in value through all changes of variables on the surface. The study reveals new relations among the intrinsic geometric properties of a curve on a surface, providing a deeper understanding of surface theory and its applications.
