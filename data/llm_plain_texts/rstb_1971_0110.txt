tldr: The article describes the fine structure and development of the zygospore in Rhizopus sexualis using light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The study provides a detailed account of the structural changes during zygospore initiation and maturation, including the dissolution of the fusion wall, delimitation of gametangia by septa, and formation of the complex zygospore wall. The behavior of nuclei and organelles, as well as the probable functions of cytoplasmic organelles and possible mechanisms controlling development, are also discussed.
