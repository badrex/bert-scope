  - Compton Effect
tldr: The authors explore the range of frequencies within the group of mechanical waves of an electron. They propose a principle of reciprocal duality between matter and radiation and discuss the implications of this concept on the behavior of electrons and photons. They also analyze the Compton effect and the scattering of X-rays by electrons, suggesting that the distance between maxima in the wave group has a definite physical significance in the phenomenon.
