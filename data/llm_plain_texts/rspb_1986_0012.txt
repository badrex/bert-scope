tldr: The study examines the relationship between sensory and motor events in spinal dogfish, observing changes in motor output when sensory activity from body movement is reduced, abolished, or modified. The research reveals a close relationship between movement amplitude and tail-beat frequency, and shows that sensory input has a strong impact on spinal cord activity, which is dependent on the intrinsic activity of the cord.
