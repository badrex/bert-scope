tldr: This article investigates the steady radial flow of viscous fluid between two inclined plane walls, focusing on the mathematical aspects of the problem. The author provides a general solution in terms of elliptic functions and discusses various types of flow, including symmetrical and non-symmetrical cases. The study also explores the relationship between Reynolds number and flow behavior, as well as the role of boundary conditions and pressure distributions in real-world experiments.
