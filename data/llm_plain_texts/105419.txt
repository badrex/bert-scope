tldr: Dr. Joseph Bruni describes the hot baths of Vinadio, their healing properties, and their effects on various ailments. The warm waters, rich in sulfur and salt, helped the Chevalier Ossorio regain feeling in his fingers and legs, and improve his overall health. The baths also provided relief for other patients with skin disorders, rheumatic complaints, and even paralysis. Bruni also mentions the weather conditions in the region during 1759, including the highest and lowest states of the barometer and thermometer.
