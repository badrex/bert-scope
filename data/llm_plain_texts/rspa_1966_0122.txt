tldr: The authors explore the use of non-metric connexions in the quasi-static plastic-elastic deformation of crystalline solids containing a continuous distribution of dislocations and extra-matter. They emphasize the importance of non-metric connexions in measuring dislocation density and describe the process of associating differentiable manifolds with each state of the solid. The study focuses on the geometrical aspects of the theory and its applications in crystal lattice deformations.
