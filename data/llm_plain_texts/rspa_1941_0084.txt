tldr: The authors discovered that visual purple, a protein found in the retina, maintains its stability and absorption spectrum at low temperatures. They also found that the photodecomposition of visual purple at low temperatures produces a photostable primary product, which is different from the thermal decomposition product, known as indicator yellow, formed at room temperature. This research provides insights into the photochemical kinetics of visual purple and its potential applications in the study of the human eye.
