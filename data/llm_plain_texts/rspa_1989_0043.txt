tldr: The authors conducted light-scattering studies on the aggregation of model colloids and immune complexes, discovering that the aggregates formed have a fractal nature. They measured the fractal dimensions and found that the aggregation followed 'Smoluchowski-like' kinetics. The results provide insights into the understanding of random aggregates and their properties.
