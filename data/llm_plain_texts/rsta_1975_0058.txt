tldr: This article discusses the geological history and fauna of the Sandettie-Fairy Bank area in the southern North Sea. The authors describe the sediment layers, fauna, and pollen found in the area, providing insights into the region's geological past and its connection to other European regions. The study reveals that the area was filled with a sequence of late Pleistocene sands overlain by Holocene sands, and the fauna and pollen found in the area suggest influences from both the English Channel and nearby European regions.
