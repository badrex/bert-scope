tldr: This article presents numerical simulations of galaxy mergers and their early evolution, focusing on the formation of elliptical galaxies. The simulations show that mergers occur from bound pairs in highly eccentric orbits, resulting in angular momentum consistent with observed rotational velocities of elliptical galaxies. The study also provides insights into the mass-radius relation and the angular momentum of merged objects.
