tldr: The author discusses recent discoveries of paleolithic tools and fossilized animal remains in Africa, which provide evidence of the presence of early humans in the region. These findings support the idea that paleolithic tools are from the same time period as the fossils, and suggest that early humans lived alongside now-extinct animals in Africa.
