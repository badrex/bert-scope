tldr: 'The article discusses the natural history of fish, focusing on the question of whether cartilaginous and spinose fish have the sense of hearing and the organs for it. The author, Mr. Klein, examines the anatomy of fish heads, identifying auditory bones and passages, and concludes that fish have the ability to hear through these organs.'
