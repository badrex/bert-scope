tldr: The author examines the sanguiferous system in Terebratula and certain other Brachiopoda species. They discovered that the perforations in the shells are occupied by membranous ceca, which are extensions of the external surface of the mantle. These ceca contain blood-corpuscles and are similar to the vascular prolongations in Ascidian and Lamellibranchiate Mollusks. The author suggests that this system may be responsible for a more specialized means of aerating the blood in these species.
