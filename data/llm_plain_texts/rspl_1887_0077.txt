tldr: This article investigates the thermal radiation in absolute measure and the electromotive properties of the electrical organ of Torpedo. The author conducts experiments to understand the changes in the organ due to mechanical injury, heat, and stimulation of its nerve. The study also examines the after-effects of passing voltaic or induction currents through the organ. The author believes that these physiological effects are all phenomena of excitation.
