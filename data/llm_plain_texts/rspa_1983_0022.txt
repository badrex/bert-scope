tldr: The authors derive the Power-Zienau-Woolley Hamiltonian in quantum electrodynamics using gauge transformation theory. They show that different gauge transformations produce different forms of Hamiltonians, and they focus on the transformations that result in the Coulomb-gauge and Power-Zienau-Woolley Hamiltonians. The study emphasizes the importance of understanding the physical significance of the Hamiltonian after the unitary transformation has been made.
