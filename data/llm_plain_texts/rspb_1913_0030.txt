tldr: 'The author discusses the fossil plants found in the Mount Potts beds of New Zealand, collected by D. G. Lillie during Captain Scott's Antarctic expedition. The plants are determined to be of Mesozoic age, either late Triassic (Rhaetian) or early Jurassic period. The discovery of these plants contributes to understanding the geological age and the possible connection of New Zealand to the Gondwana supercontinent.'
