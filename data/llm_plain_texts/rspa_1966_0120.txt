tldr: The authors extended Frenkel molecular exciton theory to include the effect of retardation on the mixing of exciton bands arising from different electronic states. They calculated the Hamiltonian and exciton energy levels to the fourth order in electronic charge, demonstrating that retardation replaces instantaneous dipole potentials with retarded resonance potentials. This study has implications for understanding the transport of electronic excitation energy and pressure broadening of absorption bands in pure gases and liquids.
