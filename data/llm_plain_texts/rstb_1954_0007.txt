tldr: This study investigates the structure and function of the male reproductive system and seasonal reproductive cycle of Elephantulus myurus jamesoni. The testes are retained in the abdominal cavity and show no seasonal variation in size or activity. The accessory sexual organs, including prostate glands, Cowper's glands, and a bilobed uterus masculinus, are active from July to January. The study provides insights into the reproductive biology of this small mammal and contributes to understanding the reproductive cycles of Insectivora.
