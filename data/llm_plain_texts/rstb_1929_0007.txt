tldr: The author investigates chromosome linkage in Oenothera hybrids and discovers that the failure of these hybrids to segregate in Mendelian fashion has a cytological basis. They find that different chromosome linkages occur in the hybrids, leading to unique inheritance patterns. This research sheds light on the potential for wild Oenothera species to have arisen through natural crossing and form true-breeding species due to chromosome linkages.
