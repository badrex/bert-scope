tldr: The authors investigated the direct conversion of cellulosic biomass to ethanol using thermophilic and anaerobic bacteria, Clostridium thermocellum and Clostridium thermosaccharolyticum. They achieved high ethanol yields by utilizing both the cellulosic and hemicellulosic fractions of biomass and improving the strains' ethanol tolerance. The process offers potential economic advantages over multi-step methods and can contribute to renewable energy production.
