semantic_tags:
  - DNA sequence evolution
  - Natural selection
  - Codon usage
  - Mutation patterns
  - Eukaryotic genes
tldr: The article discusses the evolution of eukaryotic cellular processes by analyzing DNA sequence evolution and the sounds of silence in genes. It explores how natural selection shapes synonymous codon usage patterns and reveals underlying mutational patterns. The study compares the patterns in yeast, humans, and other species, highlighting the differences and similarities in their genetic makeup and evolution.
