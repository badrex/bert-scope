tldr: The author proves Shinbrot's conjecture that weak solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations have fractional derivatives in time of any order less than 1. The proof is based on the Hardy-Littlewood maximal theorem and is valid for the two-dimensional case. In the three-dimensional case, the result is shown to be true conditionally.
