tldr: The authors develop the split-p-orbital (s.p-o) method, which allows for better inclusion of electron correlation in molecular orbital calculations. This method is applied to acetylene, showing improved agreement with experimental data and suggesting that it may provide a non-empirical treatment for unsaturated compounds. The s.p-o method simplifies calculations by using correlated orbital functions and considering vertical correlation of electrons in p-orbitals.
