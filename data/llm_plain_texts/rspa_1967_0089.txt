tldr: The authors measured the far-infrared spectra of various substituted benzenes and assigned vibrational frequencies to their fundamental vibrations. They also analyzed the intensity of the lowest frequency vibration in the p-substituted benzenes, finding a marked variation with different halogen substituents. This study provides a better understanding of the vibrational properties of substituted benzenes and their chemical structure.
