tldr: The author conducted an experiment where they injected mercury into a dog's bloodstream and observed its effects on the lungs. The dog experienced difficulty breathing, coughing, and eventually died. Upon autopsy, the author found mercury-filled blisters on the lungs and in the blood vessels. This experiment demonstrated the danger of using mercury in the human body, especially in the lungs, which are unable to effectively clear the toxic substance.
