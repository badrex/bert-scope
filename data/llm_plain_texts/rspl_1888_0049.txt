tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the plasticity and stretching properties of glacier ice. They discovered that glacier ice is composed of irregularly arranged crystals and can stretch under both tension and pressure. The rate of stretching depends on the structure and arrangement of the crystals, with some ice samples stretching at a rate of up to 0.1 cm per hour per length of 10 cm. These findings challenge common notions about glacier ice and its behavior under stress.
