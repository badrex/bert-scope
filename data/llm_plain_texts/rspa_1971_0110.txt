tldr: The authors developed an expression for predicting the variation of gas solubilities in non-polar liquids with temperature. They adapted Kirkwood and Boggs' chemical potential expression and used radial distribution functions and a molecular coupling parameter. The equation can predict the temperature coefficient of solubility for gases dissolved in common liquids with practical accuracy. This method can be useful for understanding and predicting the behavior of gases in non-polar liquids.
