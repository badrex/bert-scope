tldr: This article explores the phenomenon of exceptionally fruitful plants and its biological significance. It examines the factors that contribute to high seed production, such as soil fertility, environmental conditions, and plant competition. The author suggests that while these exceptional plants may not significantly impact plant frequency, they could play a role in restoring depleted populations and adapting to changing environments.
