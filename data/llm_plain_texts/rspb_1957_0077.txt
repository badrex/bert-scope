tldr: The article discusses the process of reviving mammals from extremely low body temperatures, focusing on techniques used to cool and resuscitate rabbits and primates. The authors describe various methods of inducing hypothermia, including using ice-cold water and internal cooling with an ice cream mixture. They also discuss challenges faced during the resuscitation process, such as damage to the stomach and the need for specialized equipment to thaw frozen animals. The research raises questions about the potential for storing and reviving larger mammals, as well as the possibility of using hypothermia in medical treatments.
