tldr: The authors report the preparation and electron spin resonance (ESR) studies of a series of crown ether complex cations and nitrido-technetium anions. They describe the structure of [Cs(18-crown-6)][TcNCl4] and [Rb(15-crown-5)2][TcNCl4(OH2)] and discuss the properties of these complex compounds, including their ESR spectra and the presence of exchange interactions in the linear chains of [Tc=N-Tc=N] units.
