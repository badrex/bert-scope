tldr: The author discusses the developmental history of mollusks and the formation of the gastrula, a crucial stage in embryonic development. They explore the process of invagination, where a hollow sac is formed by the folding of the embryo's outer layer, and its role in the development of various species. The author also examines the differences in development based on the presence of deutoplasmic matter in the egg and the importance of further research in understanding these processes.
