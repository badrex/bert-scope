tldr: 'The author examines the morphology of Trypanosoma evansi, a parasite responsible for the disease Surra in various animals. The study provides a detailed description of the parasite's size, shape, and internal structure, as well as a comparison of its distribution in India and Sudan. The author concludes that the similarities in the distribution of the parasite's length in both regions provide evidence that the disease in both locations is caused by the same species of trypanosome.'
