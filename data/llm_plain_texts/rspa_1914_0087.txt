tldr: The authors studied the properties of aluminium-gold alloys with less than 5% aluminium by weight. They created a concentration-temperature diagram and discovered that alloys can be solid below 525Â°C. They also observed a phenomenon called recalescence, where alloys with a specific aluminium content undergo a temperature increase and structural change. This change is due to a reaction between the components of the alloy and results in a new, stable state.
