tldr: The article presents a psychophysical study on a human observer with an abnormal visual response to moving and colored stimuli. The study demonstrates that time-dependent spreading of inhibition around a colored stimulus is disinhibited by a moving stimulus, suggesting interactions between cortical mechanisms sensitive to movement and those sensitive to color. The findings provide evidence of a central origin for these response abnormalities.
