tldr: The authors developed a linear model of a wave packet in a boundary layer on a flat plate, which was artificially excited by a localized pulsed perturbation at the wall boundary. They compared the model's behavior with experimental measurements and found that the overall shapes of the disturbed region and the way it spread out as the packet traveled downstream were well predicted by the model. However, detailed comparisons of the wave motion within the wave packet showed some discrepancies far downstream.
