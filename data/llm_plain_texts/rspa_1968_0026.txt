tldr: The authors investigated the temperature dependence of the spin wave energy in the itinerant electron model of ferromagnetism. They found that the spin wave energy follows a specific law at low temperatures and calculated its numerical values for a single tightly bound energy band corresponding to a simple cubic lattice structure. The results provide insights into the behavior of ferromagnetic materials and can be used to analyze experimental data related to spin wave resonance methods.
