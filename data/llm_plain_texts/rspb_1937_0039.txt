tldr: This study investigates the effects of posterior pituitary extract on the stomach health of various animals. The administration of the extract causes changes in the stomach, including engorgement, hemorrhage, and erosion of the mucosa. The researchers also observe that the presence of acid-secreting oxyntic cells is essential for the production of these gastric lesions. The findings suggest that the pituitary gland plays a significant role in regulating alimentary blood flow and secretion.
