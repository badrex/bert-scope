tldr: This article discusses the effects of vagus stimulation on ventricular contractions and the determination of melting points of organic substances. The author demonstrates that vagus stimulation reduces the excitability and tonicity of the ventricle when it reduces the force of contractions. The article also presents a new method for determining melting points using a simple apparatus and discusses the identification of series by melting points.
