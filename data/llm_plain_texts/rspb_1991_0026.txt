tldr: The authors analyze the distribution of species abundances in large species assemblages and find that it follows a lognormal distribution, truncated on the left at the "veil line." They use Sugihara's model to predict and explain the left-skewness observed in the distribution of British bird species abundances, providing a better understanding of species abundance patterns in communities of various sizes.
