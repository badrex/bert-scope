tldr: The authors describe the wave-speed camera, a photographic method for measuring the velocities of shock waves and detonation rates in gases and solid explosives. They also discuss its applications, such as studying the flight of bullets and analyzing the after-movements of flames and gases. The camera uses the Schlieren method, which involves photographing the horizontal movement of atmospheric disturbances on a vertically moving film.
