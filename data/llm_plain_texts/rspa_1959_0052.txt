tldr: The authors used paramagnetic resonance experiments to study exchange interactions in antiferromagnetic chloroiridate salts. They found that the isotropic part of the Ir-Ir exchange is antiferromagnetic and of magnitude 6, and there is an anisotropic part with rhombic symmetry and a magnitude of about 1. The results provide a basis for discussing the bulk magnetic properties of the salts.
