tldr: This article discusses the structure and function of chromomeres in eukaryotic chromosomes. The author argues that chromomeres are not functional units themselves but are passively generated by the transcriptional activity of interspersed functional units. The author also compares chromomeres in lampbrush chromosomes and polytene chromosomes, highlighting their differences and the need for further research to understand their roles in gene organization and function.
