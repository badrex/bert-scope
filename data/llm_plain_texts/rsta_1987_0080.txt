tldr: This article summarizes the progress and potential of accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) in various fields, including dating, archaeometry, and environmental studies. AMS has improved the accuracy and efficiency of radiocarbon dating, making it a promising alternative to conventional methods. Additionally, AMS has been used to study environmental tracers like 10Be, 26Al, and 36Cl, offering insights into geological processes. The article also discusses the development of laser spectroscopy techniques, such as resonance ionization spectroscopy, which could complement AMS in the future.
