tldr: The authors conducted experiments on mild steel to study its torsional hysteresis behavior under various stress conditions. They designed a sensitive torsion machine to measure the stress-strain curve and observed the existence of hysteresis loops in mild steel. The study also investigated the effects of plastic overstrains, rest, and mild heat treatment on the hysteresis behavior.
