tldr: The authors identified and analyzed the morphological and electrophysiological properties of inhibitory interneurons in the recurrent collateral network of the Mauthner cell. They discovered that these neurons produce both electrical and chemical inhibitions of the Mauthner cell and have unique axon terminations that form large bulbs surrounding the axon cap. This research provides insights into the complex network of inhibitory interneurons and their role in the nervous system.
