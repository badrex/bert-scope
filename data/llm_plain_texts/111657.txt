tldr: The author, Edward Sabine, studied the diurnal variation of the magnetic declination at Pekin and observed a double progression in the 24 hours. This double progression was found to be related to magnetic storms, which affected the Earth's magnetic field. The study aimed to understand the influence of these storms on the Earth's magnetic field and its variations.
