  - Temperature effects
  - Interference method
  - Gas density
tldr: The author conducted experiments using the interference method to study the refractive index of gases and its dependence on temperature. They found that the refractive index of gases is proportional to their density and demonstrated the superiority of the coefficient 0.0360. This research provided a better understanding of the relationship between gas properties and temperature.
