tldr: 'John Smeaton observed and compared the temperature of the air at Edystone and Plymouth between the 7th and 14th of July 1757. He found that the temperature varied significantly within a small distance and noted how squalls of wind can be confined to small spaces. This study highlights the importance of local weather conditions and their variations.'
