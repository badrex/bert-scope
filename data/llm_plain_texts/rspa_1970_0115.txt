tldr: This study investigates vibrational relaxation in pure CO2 and CO2-N2 mixtures using a shock tube. The laser-schlieren method was employed to measure relaxation times from 360 to 1500K. The results show that relaxation times are a function of translational temperature and do not depend on the system's equilibrium state. The findings challenge current theories of vibrational relaxation and provide insights into the collision processes important in lasers.
