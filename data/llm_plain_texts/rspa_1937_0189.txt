tldr: The authors conducted experiments using a radioactive vapor to study the continuous spectrum of thorium C. They discovered the shape of the spectrum and found that the majority of emitted particles were thorium atoms. The study also observed the association between disintegration electrons and -rays, providing evidence for the branching of the thorium series at thorium C.
