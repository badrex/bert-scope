tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine if domestic fowls in Uganda could act as reservoirs for the virus of sleeping sickness (Trypanosoma gambiense). They found that fowls could be infected by the bites of laboratory-bred and laboratory-infected Glossina palpalis, but they were unable to transmit the virus to clean laboratory-bred Glossina palpalis. This suggests that domestic fowls may not play a significant role in the transmission of sleeping sickness.
