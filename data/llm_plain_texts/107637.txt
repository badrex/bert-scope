tldr: The author examines the heights of places in the Trigonometrical Survey of Great Britain, focusing on the latitude of Arbury Hill. They use accurate levelling to determine the height of Arbury Hill and other stations, comparing their findings with the published data. The author suggests that more observations with the zenith sector at other stations would help clarify the ambiguity in the survey's results.
