tldr: This article discusses the evolution and structure of the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, focusing on the geological and geophysical data collected during the International Indian Ocean Expedition. The authors use the theory of seafloor spreading and plate tectonics to explain the formation and development of the Gulf of Aden, which links the East African rift valley system and the Red Sea with the Carlsberg Ridge in the NW Indian Ocean. They analyze bathymetric and magnetic data to understand the crustal structure and the role of transform faults in the region.
