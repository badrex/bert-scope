tldr: The authors studied the oxidation behavior of Fe-Ni-Cr alloys, focusing on the non-protective oxide growth. They used transmission electron microscopy to investigate the microstructure and microchemistry of the scales formed on the alloys. The results showed that both outward and inward growth of chemically and structurally different oxides occurred in various ways, sometimes with lateral and temporal instability. This research provides insights into the understanding of the oxidation process and potential applications in material science.
