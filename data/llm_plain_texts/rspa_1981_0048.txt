tldr: This article explores the uniform asymptotics for spherical and cylindrical nonlinear acoustic waves generated by sinusoidal sources. The study focuses on the propagation of sound waves in thermoviscous fluids and provides expansions for the problem that are uniformly valid in the parameters space and space-time. The results are applicable to both spherical and cylindrical waves, and the article discusses various asymptotic domains and their corresponding solutions.
