tldr: This article explores the role of the prefrontal cortex in self-consciousness, specifically in the case of auditory hallucinations experienced by patients with schizophrenia. The author proposes that hallucinations occur due to disordered interactions between the prefrontal cortex and posterior brain regions. The study suggests that abnormal experiences in auditory hallucinations arise in the same systems engaged when people listen to external speech or generate inner speech.
