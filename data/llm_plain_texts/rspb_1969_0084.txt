tldr: The authors studied the boring mechanisms of two wood-boring bivalves, Martesia striata and Xylophaga dorsalis. They discovered that both species use a cyclical repetition of movements called the boring cycle to penetrate wood. Martesia striata and Xylophaga dorsalis have different boring cycles, with the latter having more elaborate contractions of the adductor muscles. The material abraded from the burrow is collected and ejected as pseudofaeces or stored as faecal pellets to plug the burrow. The pressures developed during boring are small compared to burrowing forms but play a crucial role in the hydraulic system of these wood-boring bivalves.
