tldr: In 1695, Nicolas Witsen reported on the devastating volcanic eruption on Mount Gounong Apy in the Banda Islands. The eruption caused a series of earthquakes, the spewing of hot stones and flames, and the destruction of trees and farmland. The volcanic activity also affected the local climate, causing sickness and a significant decrease in crop production. Witsen's account highlights the importance of understanding the impacts of natural disasters on the environment and human life.
