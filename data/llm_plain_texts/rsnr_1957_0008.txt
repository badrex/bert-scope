tldr: 'Edmond Halley, a versatile man with a strong interest in astronomy, made significant contributions to the field. He observed and cataloged southern stars, made improvements to the tables of planets, and observed a solar eclipse. Halley also planned and undertook an expedition to St. Helena to observe the southern sky, where he made important observations and discovered the first complete observation of a transit of Mercury. His work helped improve the understanding of the positions of stars and the accuracy of astronomical observations.'
