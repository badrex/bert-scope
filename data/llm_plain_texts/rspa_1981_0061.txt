tldr: The study examines the effect of finite thickness on the stability of a stretching vortex sheet in an inviscid fluid. A uniform circular cylindrical vortex layer of constant vorticity undergoes radial expansion driven by a concentric line source. The stability analysis reveals that the layer remains stable provided the stretching rate is faster than the time scale of the disturbances. The results show that the expansion of the vortex layer delays the appearance of the instability and damps out short waves.
