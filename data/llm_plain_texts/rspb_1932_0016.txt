tldr: The authors investigated the nervous control of carbohydrate metabolism and localized the diabetic center in the brain. They used decerebration and various brain operations to study the effects on blood sugar levels. The results showed that the floor of the fourth ventricle played a significant role in the nervous control of carbohydrate metabolism. The authors also found that other forms of experimental hyperglycemia could still occur even with anesthesia, indicating the complexity of the nervous system's control over metabolism.
