tldr: This article discusses the nature of fiber reinforced plastics and their implications for structural design. It examines three phenomena: compressive behavior, tensile notch sensitivity, and transverse cracking in multidirectional laminates. The authors explore the effects of temperature, moisture, and environmental exposure on the performance of these materials, and provide design considerations for improving their structural integrity.
