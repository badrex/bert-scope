tldr: The author presents a design for a percussion shell that can explode at the bottom of the sea. The shell contains a rod of iron suspended within a tube, which, upon impact with the sea floor, falls and triggers the percussion and explosion. The author also suggests using percussion powder made from silver, which can explode even when mixed with water, to improve waterproofing.
