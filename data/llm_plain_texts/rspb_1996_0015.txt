tldr: 'Researchers analyzed mitochondrial and microsatellite DNA variation in common cuckoos parasitizing different host species. They found no significant genetic differences between cuckoos from various hosts, suggesting that egg color variation may be facultative or that gene flow between host-specific groups is high. This study helps to understand the coevolutionary interactions between hosts and parasites in birds.'
