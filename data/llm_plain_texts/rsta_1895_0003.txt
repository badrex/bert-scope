tldr: This article investigates the propagation of magnetization in iron and its relation to electric currents. The authors conducted experiments using an electromagnet and observed the changes in magnetization at different depths in the iron core after reversing the electric current. They found that the initial change of induction was significantly affected by the small non-magnetic space between the pole pieces, which led to an unequal distribution of induction over the whole surface. The authors also attempted to obtain an approximation to the cyclic curve of induction from the experimental data but were unsuccessful due to imperfections in the fit of the pole pieces.
