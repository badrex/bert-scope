tldr: This study examines the relationship between fluctuating asymmetry, competition, and dominance in European starlings. Researchers found that levels of fluctuating asymmetry in the birds' primary feathers were influenced by nutritional and energetic stress. The results showed that dominant birds exhibited higher levels of fluctuating asymmetry, suggesting that they may only benefit from their social status during severe competition conditions.
