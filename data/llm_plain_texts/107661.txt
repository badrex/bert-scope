tldr: The author, George Knox, conducted experiments to determine the presence of bitumen in various types of stones. Through distillation and ignition processes, he found that bitumen exists in several stones, including Pitch-stone, Basalt, Green-stone, and Wacke. The study also revealed the formation of pumice and the potential role of bitumen in the natural formation of pumice. The author did not support any specific theory but shared his findings and methods for future research.
