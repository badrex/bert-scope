tldr: The author discusses the mystery of the vast amount of salt in the Mediterranean Sea. He examines water samples from various depths collected by Captain Smyth. The sample taken from a depth of 670 fathoms had a density exceeding that of distilled water, supporting the theory of a denser current carrying salt westward into the Atlantic Ocean.
