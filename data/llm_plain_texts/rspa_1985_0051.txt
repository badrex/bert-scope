tldr: This article investigates the Gortler vortex instability mechanism in three-dimensional boundary layers, focusing on the flow over an infinitely long swept cylinder with variable curvature. The study shows how the structure of the instability changes as the crossflow and chordwise flow ratios increase, and how the Gortler instability mechanism may not be operational in certain regimes. The findings have implications for laminar-flow airfoils and other practical situations involving three-dimensional boundary layers.
