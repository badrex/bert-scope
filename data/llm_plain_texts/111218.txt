tldr: Joseph Toynbee's study examines the muscles responsible for opening the Eustachian tube and their role in the process of swallowing. He concludes that the Eustachian tubes are closed during normal hearing and that the act of swallowing opens the tubes, allowing air to enter the middle ear. Toynbee also discusses the differences in Eustachian tube muscles and functions in various animals and debunks the analogy between the tympanum and musical instruments that require open air chambers.
