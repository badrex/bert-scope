tldr: The authors explore the concept of asymptotic expansions and converging factors in mathematical physics. They demonstrate that by applying Borel's method of summation to the later terms of an asymptotic expansion, the sum can be replaced by a series involving basic converging factors. This allows for the calculation of the remainder in a truncated asymptotic expansion and the expression of the Stokes phenomenon in terms of discontinuities in these basic quantities.
