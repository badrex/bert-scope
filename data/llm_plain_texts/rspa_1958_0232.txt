tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the absolute thermoelectric power of alkali metals at low temperatures. They found that the experimental results did not match the predictions of the modern theory of electron transport in metals. The authors also discussed the 'phonon-drag' effect and its potential role in contributing to the thermo-electric power of the heavier alkali metals. They concluded that further research is needed to understand the behavior of these metals and their thermoelectric properties.
