tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the viscosity of hydrogen halides using the transpiration method. They controlled the evaporation process and measured the masses of gas passing through a capillary tube. The results were used to calculate the viscosity and provide insights into the properties of these gases. This study contributes to understanding the behavior of gases and their applications in various fields.
