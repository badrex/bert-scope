tldr: The author, Alfred Hutchison Smee, presents a method called "distillation by cold" to detect and determine ammonia and other organic impurities in the atmosphere. This technique involves using a glass funnel filled with ice to collect dew, which is then tested for ammonia content. The author demonstrates the effectiveness of this method in various environments, including gardens, bedrooms, and hospital wards.
