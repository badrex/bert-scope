tldr: In this research, Michael Faraday investigates the relationship between electric and magnetic forces. He conducts experiments using crystals and the voltaic current to explore the nature of inductive action. Faraday concludes that compound particles in a body polarize as wholes and discusses the implications of this finding for the understanding of electric and magnetic forces.
