tldr: The authors developed a new experimental method to determine the thermal conductivity of air and other gases. They used parallel plates maintained at different temperatures, with an insulating ring to minimize convection currents. The method was tested with two different apparatus designs, and the results showed that the thermal conductivity of air at ordinary pressures and near 0Â°C was approximately 0.024 cgs units.
