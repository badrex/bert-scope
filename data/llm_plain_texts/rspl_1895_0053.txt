tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the laws of attrition and the coefficient of attrition. They developed an apparatus to measure the amount of material removed when two solid surfaces are rubbed together under specified conditions. The results showed that the amount removed is proportional to the pressure, and they introduced the concept of the coefficient of attrition as a measure of a substance's properties. This research contributes to understanding the wear and friction between materials.
