tldr: The authors present a general method for determining the distribution of kinetic energy releases in unimolecular ionic reactions occurring in the analyser of a mass spectrometer. They show that the method is applicable to reactions with a wide range of average kinetic energy release and provide accurate values for the first time using a generally applicable technique. The authors also explore the relation between the average kinetic energy released and the width at half-height of the corresponding metastable peak for peaks of various shapes.
