tldr: This article presents an X-ray study of the structure of hair, wool, and related fibers. The researchers found that a significant portion of the structure of these fibers is crystalline or pseudo-crystalline, and that the X-ray photographs of unstretched and stretched hair are different. The study also reveals the dimensions of the fibers and their molecular structure, providing insights into their properties and behavior.
