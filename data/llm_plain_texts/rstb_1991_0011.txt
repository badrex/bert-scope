tldr: 'The authors studied the effects of cytochalasin D on the actin cytoskeleton of pollen tubes in Narcissus pseudonarcissus and Endymion nonscriptus. They found that cytochalasin D caused the actin microfilaments to form massive, randomly oriented bundles. During recovery, the actin fibril system reconstituted, and movement was restored in the vegetative cells. The blocked pollen tubes initiated new growing points, and the normal movement pathways and apical zonation of organelles were reestablished.'
