tldr: This article explores the concept of continents as a chemical boundary layer and examines the origin and evolution of the Earth's continental crust. It discusses the differences between the properties of the continental and oceanic crust, and how the continental crust forms part of the surficial chemical boundary layer. The article also investigates the role of double-diffusive instabilities and the formation of supercontinents in the process of continental evolution.
