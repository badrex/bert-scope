tldr: The author examines discrepancies observed in the Cavendish apparatus for determining the mean density of the Earth, focusing on the influence of magnetic states of the masses and balls. They propose a hypothesis that the magnetic state of the materials could be a significant factor affecting the measurements, which could explain the discrepancies and improve the accuracy of the apparatus.
