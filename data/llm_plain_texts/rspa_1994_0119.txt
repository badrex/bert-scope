tldr: This article studies the existence of approximate travelling waves in generalized KPP equations using classical mechanics and the method of Elworthy and Truman. The authors construct a classical path that is the backward flow of a Newtonian mechanics with given initial position and velocity. They use the Feynman-Kac formula and the Maruyama-Girsanov-Cameron-Martin transformation to obtain an identity that shows the propagation of the global wave front and the shape of the trough. The theory demonstrates how the initial distribution contributes to the propagation of the travelling wave.
