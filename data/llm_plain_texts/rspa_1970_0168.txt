tldr: The author discusses the stresses near the tip of a crack in a fibrous composite, specifically a carbon-reinforced epoxy resin, and the work of fracture in such materials. They find that the composite's extreme elastic anisotropy leads to a large concentration of shear stress parallel to the fibers, which exceeds the transverse stress normal to the fibers. This results in the matrix shearing parallel to the fibers before a fiber ahead of the crack is broken, and the crack advances. The author also explores the effects of interface strength on the material's behavior.
