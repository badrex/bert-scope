tldr: This article discusses the differences and similarities between marine and terrestrial organisms' distribution patterns. It compares the "peninsula effect" and the "bay effect" and presents examples of coral reefs in Mochima Bay, Venezuela, and fish in the Baltic Sea. The author argues that marine biogeographical regions are less well-defined than terrestrial ones due to the larger, continuous, and three-dimensional nature of the world's oceans. The article also explores the concept of cosmopolitanism and its application to marine and terrestrial biotas, using the example of bats and whales.
