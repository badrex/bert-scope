tldr: This study investigates how the sensations from both eyes contribute to brightness threshold measurements. The research focuses on two aspects: the steady state of adaptation and the changing state of adaptation. The results show that binocular vision offers a slight advantage in brightness threshold sensitivity, particularly in parafoveal vision at medium and high brightness levels. The study also finds no significant interaction between the two eyes when measuring brightness threshold sensitivity.
