tldr: The authors studied the lorica construction in the type species of Calliacantha Leadbeater, a marine choanoflagellate. They used light and electron microscopy to analyze the structure and provide a detailed account of the assembly at the anterior end and the variability at the hind end of the lorica. The study helps clarify the taxonomy and phyletic interpretation of this species.
