tldr: This study investigates the deposition behavior of atmospheric gases, such as argon, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide, on cold surfaces. The experiments reveal that argon and nitrogen deposit when the incident gas pressure equals the sublimation pressure at the respective surface temperature, while carbon dioxide requires considerable supersaturation. The results help determine the critical nucleus size and the adsorption energy, providing a better understanding of the condensation process.
