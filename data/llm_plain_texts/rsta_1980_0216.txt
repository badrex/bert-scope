tldr: This article examines the evidence for chemical heterogeneity in the Earth's mantle beneath southern Africa using data from mantle-derived igneous rocks and peridotites found in kimberlite. The study assesses the scale, timing, and development of mantle heterogeneity and suggests that it existed at 3 billion years ago and was well established by 2 billion years ago. The research also provides evidence for progressive development of variability in Sr isotope ratios in the mantle source regions.
