tldr: This article discusses the crustal structure and subsidence mechanisms of oceanic islands, focusing on the islands of Oahu, Bermuda, and Bikini. The authors analyze seismic, gravity, and magnetic observations and propose that crustal flexure and plastic squeezing of sediments contribute to subsidence. They caution that interpretations of geophysical observations may be influenced by geological assumptions and analytical theories, and emphasize the need for multiple lines of investigation to better understand the phenomenon of subsidence beneath oceanic islands.
