tldr: The authors present new forms and properties of the general solution of the three-dimensional dynamic equation for the displacement vector in an isotropic linear elastic solid. They solve the initial value problem in an unbounded medium with no sources and provide a general solution at an arbitrary time using two asymptotic vector fields. The complete elastic field energy of an arbitrary exact solution is shown to depend only on these two asymptotic vector fields.
