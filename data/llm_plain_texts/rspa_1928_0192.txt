tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the soft X-ray levels of iron, cobalt, nickel, and copper. They discovered new levels and transitions within these elements, which helped explain the discrepancies in previous X-ray emission data. Their findings contribute to a better understanding of atomic physics and the behavior of elements under different conditions.
