tldr: The author conducted experiments on animals to study the origin of sympathetic fibers from the spinal cord and their effects on the body. They discovered the origin of fibers responsible for dilation of the pupil, opening of the eyelids, and retraction of the nictitating membrane. The study also includes observations on white and grey rami communicantes and their functions in the autonomic nervous system.
