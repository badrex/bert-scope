tldr: The author re-calculates magnetic survey data using the method of least squares to analyze earth-air currents and their effect on magnetic forces. The study focuses on the distribution of magnetic forces and their potential relation to earth-air currents, providing a clearer understanding of the forces at play. The results show a strong connection between the direction of the currents and latitude, with upward currents in polar regions and downward currents in lower altitudes.
