tldr: The authors studied the air afterglow, a chemiluminescent phenomenon, to investigate reactions involving atomic oxygen. They developed a method to determine the concentration of atomic oxygen and explored its interactions with various gases. The findings provide insights into the kinetics and mechanisms of atomic oxygen reactions, demonstrating the potential of the air afterglow as a tool for studying gas-phase reactions.
