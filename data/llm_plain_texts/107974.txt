tldr: The author examines the mammary glands of the Ornithorhynchus paradoxus, a monotreme species, and finds that they possess developed mammary glands similar to those of other mammals. This discovery challenges previous theories that these animals do not belong to the mammal class due to the absence of mammary glands and nipples. The author's findings support the classification of monotremes as a distinct order of mammals, bridging the gap between reptiles and mammals.
