tldr: The authors investigated the persistence of the liquid state of aggregation in ethylene systems above the critical temperature. They discovered that a density difference exists in the medium, which persists above the critical temperature and can be destroyed by expansion, temperature gradient, or compression. This phenomenon has implications for understanding phase transitions and the behavior of substances near their critical points.
