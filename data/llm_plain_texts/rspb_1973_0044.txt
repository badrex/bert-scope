tldr: The authors studied the molecular changes in the plasma membrane of sporangiospores of Phycomyces during germination. They used freeze-fracturing techniques to observe the membrane's structure and found that the membrane undergoes significant changes during germination. The researchers discovered two types of large particles, homogeneous and compound, which are related to the controlled dormancy and germination of the spores. These findings provide insights into the functioning of cell membranes and the process of germination in fungi.
