tldr: The authors analyze the significance of the ligament in the classification of bivalve molluscs. They provide evidence for the union of Carditacea and Astartacea in the superfamily Crassatellacea, differences between Pectinidae and Spondylidae, and the association of Plicatulidae with Dimyidae in the proposed superfamily Plicatulacea. They also discuss the evolution of the cemented Etheriidae, the adaptive radiation in the Anomiacea, and the unifying character within the order Anomalodesmata.
