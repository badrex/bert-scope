tldr: The study examines the post-ecdysial development of the cuticle and eye in the Devonian trilobite Phacops rana milleri. Specimens in various stages of the early post-ecdysial cycle were analyzed to determine how much cuticle carbonate was removed and renewed during moulting, and how specialized cuticular organs, such as the schizochroal eyes, were reconstructed after exuviation.
