tldr: 'This study examines the Tertiary structural development of selected valleys in the Basin and Range province of northeastern Nevada using seismic reflexion profiles, outcrop, and well data. The valleys contain Tertiary sediments that define an asymmetrical basin bounded by a major listric normal fault with 3.0-4.5 km of displacement. The Tertiary depocentre shifts from west to east with continued slippage through time, with the greatest movement occurring in the Miocene and post-Miocene. The valleys' structural development is complex, with variations in Tertiary stratigraphy and the presence of pre-Miocene sections in some sub-basins.'
