tldr: This article investigates the mechanism of sap ascent and transpiration in plants. The authors conclude that the primary cause of sap ascent is the capillary action of tracheal tissue and the transpiration activity of the leaf. They also discover that the stable state of the liquid sap, due to its internal stability and the structure of the conducting tissue, allows it to withstand tensile stress without rupturing. The authors propose that this mechanism can be applied to explain how plants can lift water from the roots to the leaves against gravity.
