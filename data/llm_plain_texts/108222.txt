tldr: In this article, Charles Bell discusses his investigations into the nervous system, focusing on the functions of motor and sensory roots in the spinal nerves. He explains how the anterior roots are responsible for motion, while the posterior roots are responsible for sensation. Bell also shares various case studies and experiments to support his findings and demonstrates the importance of understanding the functions of the nervous system in medicine and physiology.
