tldr: The authors discuss the possibility of extra-galactic sources contributing to the primary cosmic-ray flux. They review previous theories and observations, focusing on the energetic considerations and propagation of particles from these sources. The authors argue that extra-galactic sources, such as strong radio galaxies and quasi-stellar objects, could be responsible for a significant portion of the cosmic-ray flux, challenging the traditional view that cosmic rays primarily originate from within our own galaxy.
