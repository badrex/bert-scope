tldr: This article examines the mechanisms of vorticity generation in bores, focusing on the creation of turbulence and the differences between hydraulic jumps and bores. It discusses various models and theories, including Longuet-Higgins and Turner's model of spilling breakers and Yeh and Mok's generation-advection cycle. The article also highlights the importance of considering the air-water interface and the effects of both normal and tangential stresses on vorticity creation.
