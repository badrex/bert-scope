tldr: The authors conducted nuclear alinement and angular correlation experiments to study the decay of manganese-56. They determined the energies and intensities of gamma rays, analyzed the spin and parity of excited states, and investigated the angular correlation between gamma-ray cascades. Their findings provide insights into the nuclear structure and decay processes of manganese-56.
