tldr: This study investigates the effect of solvent on the reaction velocity between N-chloroacetanilide and hydrobromic acid in dilute aqueous solutions. The authors found that the reaction rate is influenced by the solvent's dielectric constant, which affects the interaction between the reactants. This research contributes to understanding the role of solvents in chemical reactions and the development of more accurate reaction models.
