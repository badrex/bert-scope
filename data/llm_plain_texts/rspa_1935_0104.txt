tldr: The article investigates the equilibrium and instability of a cylindrical thread of a viscous liquid surrounded by another viscous fluid. The authors consider the effects of interfacial surface tension and viscous forces on the thread's stability and provide mathematical solutions for various cases. They also compare their theoretical findings with experimental observations, demonstrating the relationship between the maximum instability and the ratio of the fluids' viscosities.
