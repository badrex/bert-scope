tldr: F. Hauksbee conducted experiments at the Royal Society to study how sound propagates in condensed air. He found that sound became more intense as air pressure increased, but after a certain point, the sound intensity did not increase proportionally. Hauksbee also tested his experiment in an open field and observed similar results. He attributed the limitations of his experiment to air leakage and the difficulty of maintaining precise atmospheric pressure.
