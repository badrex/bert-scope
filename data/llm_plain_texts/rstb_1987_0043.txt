tldr: This study investigates the long-term effects of diesel oil on intertidal and subtidal marine communities using two medium-scale ecosystems (mesocosms) built on the Oslofjord. The results show that oil pollution caused high mortality of Mytilus edulis and reduced growth in Ascophyllum nodosum and Laminaria digitata. Recruitment of Littorina littorea was also affected, leading to declining populations. The study highlights the importance of mesocosms in understanding the effects of pollutants on marine organisms and simulating real-world scenarios.
