tldr: The authors investigated the Brownian fluctuations in galvanometers and galvanometer amplifiers, both theoretically and experimentally. They determined the limit of observation set by thermal agitation on moving-coil galvanometers and galvanometer amplifiers. The study covered the Brownian motion of a galvanometer with an appreciable inductance in its circuit and a galvanometer amplifier containing two galvanometers with arbitrary conditions of damping. The results confirmed Ising's result and the theoretical investigations, showing that the theoretical limit can be consistently attained in practice.
