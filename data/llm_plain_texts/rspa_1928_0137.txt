  - Flame propagation
tldr: This article examines the detonation wave and pre-detonation period in gaseous mixtures, focusing on the shock waves and their effects on flame propagation. The study investigates the conditions under which detonation is set up and maintained, and how these waves contribute to the different modes of flame propagation. The research also explores the inception of detonation in gaseous mixtures and the role of compression waves in the initial phases of explosions.
