tldr: The authors investigate the chromogens in white flowers and their role in anthocyan pigment formation. They discover that white flowers contain both oxydase and chromogen, but the lack of interaction between these components results in the absence of color. The study classifies white flowers into three types based on the presence or absence of oxydase and chromogen, providing insights into the mechanisms of color production in plants.
