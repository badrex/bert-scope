tldr: This article describes the case of James Jones, who suffered from a pelvic tumor and bone disease. The author, Richard Browne Cheston, conducted a detailed analysis of the patient's bones after maceration, revealing the extent of the disease and providing insights into its nature. The findings highlight the importance of the cartilage connecting the ossa pubis as a boundary to the disease and the role of external lamellae in bone health.
