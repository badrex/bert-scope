tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of arylcarbamic esters and related compounds on seed germination and early plant growth. They discovered that isopropyl phenylcarbamate and some related compounds have a significant impact on the germination and seedling growth of cereals, while having no effect on some dicotyledonous plants. The study also found that certain concentrations of these compounds can prevent germination or restrict seedling growth in some plant species, while having no effect on others.
