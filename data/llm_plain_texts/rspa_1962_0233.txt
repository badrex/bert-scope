tldr: The authors studied the kinetics of the base-catalyzed bromination of nitroacetone in aqueous buffer solutions. They found that the reaction is of zero order with respect to bromine and exhibits general catalysis by bases. The results are discussed in relation to the behavior of analogous substances and provide insights into the ionization of substituted ketones and esters in the presence of basic catalysts.
