tldr: This study investigates the palaeomagnetism of the geological column in Great Britain, analyzing the directions of remanent magnetization in rocks of various formations. The results provide evidence for polar wandering and continental drift, as well as reversals of the geomagnetic field. The findings support the hypothesis of polar wandering as a more satisfactory explanation for the observed movements than continental drift.
