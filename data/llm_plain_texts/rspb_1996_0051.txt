tldr: The authors developed a quantitative genetic recursion to study the evolution of life history traits under frequency-dependent selection and overlapping generations. They found that evolutionarily stable strategies can differ from those that maximize population mean fitness, and that frequency-dependent selection can cause evolution towards smaller or larger phenotypes depending on the expected value of a specific parameter.
