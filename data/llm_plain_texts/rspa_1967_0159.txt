tldr: This article investigates the flow of conducting fluid through an insulating pipe with a uniform magnetic field applied perpendicular to the flow. The authors analyze the Hartmann boundary layer, the mainstream, and the complicated boundary-layer singularity at specific points on the wall. They provide a formal solution and use boundary-layer methods to determine the behavior of the fluid and induced magnetic field in different regions of the pipe.
