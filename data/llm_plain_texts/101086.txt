tldr: In a letter to the publisher, John Ray discusses the concept of spontaneous generation and the possibility of insects smelling of musk. He mentions two types of insects that emit a musky scent and refers to the work of fellow naturalist, Francesco Redi, who has made progress in proving that insects are not spontaneously generated. Ray also mentions his observations of a porpess, a type of fish, and its unique characteristics.
