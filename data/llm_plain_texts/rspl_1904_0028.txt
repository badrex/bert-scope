tldr: The author conducted a series of experiments to study the effects of Indian cobra venom on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. They found that the venom directly affects blood vessels, causing constriction and increasing arterial blood pressure. The venom also has a direct action on the heart, both through its muscular tissue and the intracardiac vagal mechanism. The study highlights the importance of understanding the effects of cobra venom for potential treatments and prevention of cobra poisoning.
