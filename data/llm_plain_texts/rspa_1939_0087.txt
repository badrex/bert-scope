tldr: This study investigates the attachment of inert gas atoms to alkali ions, focusing on lithium ions in various gases. The researchers observed that the heavier the gas atom, the higher the temperature at which it forms a cluster with a lithium ion. The findings provide insights into the behavior of ions and gas atoms in different environments and the mechanisms of cluster formation.
