tldr: The authors study the Neogene intra-Carpathian basins and their formation, proposing that they are extensional and thermal in origin. They analyze the subsidence histories, heat flow, and crustal thickness of these basins, concluding that they were formed by stretching and thinning of the lithosphere. The authors compare observed subsidence profiles with theoretical subsidence curves, providing evidence for their extensional model.
