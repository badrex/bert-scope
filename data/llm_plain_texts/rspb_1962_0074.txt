tldr: The article discusses protein metabolism in human protein malnutrition, focusing on the effects of inadequate diets on infants. It highlights the changes in body composition, organ and tissue function, and cellular levels in protein-depleted individuals. The author also examines the dynamic aspects of protein metabolism, including catabolism and synthesis, and the capacity for protein synthesis in malnourished children once proper nutrition is provided.
