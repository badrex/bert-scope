tldr: This article discusses the catalytic activity, crystal structure, and adsorptive properties of evaporated metal films. It also explores the effect of long-chain polar compounds on the coefficients of kinetic friction. The research shows that oriented metal films have higher catalytic activity and that long-chain polar compounds can improve the friction between surfaces by creating a "wedging effect." The findings have implications for the development of better lubricants and wear-prevention agents.
