tldr: This article investigates the interaction between bismuth metal and tungsten oxide (W03) and discovers novel intergrowth bronze phases with varying periodicities. Bismuth is found to be in the 3+ state, and the bronze structures exhibit interesting properties such as electrical resistivity and itinerant electrons. The study also reveals that the maximum value of x in BixW03 appears to be around 0.07.
