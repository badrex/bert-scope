revised_title: 'Investigation of Electrical Conductivity in Gases Traversed by Cathode Rays'
semantic_tags:
  - Cathode rays

  - Ionization
  - Electrometer
  - Gas discharge
tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the electrical conductivity in gases when traversed by cathode rays. They found that the gases became conductive due to the production of positive and negative ions. The author used an electrometer to measure the ionizations produced in different gases and compared the ionizations produced by cathode and Rontgen rays.
