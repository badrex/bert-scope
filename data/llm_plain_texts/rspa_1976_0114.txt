tldr: The absorption spectrum of Mn I in the energy region corresponding to the excitation of the 3p subshell has been recorded for the first time. The spectrum shows at least 10 discrete features and a broad modulation in the continuous absorption above the threshold. The spectrum is dominated by a 'giant resonance' and is discussed in relation to previous photoabsorption data for nearby elements in the periodic table.
