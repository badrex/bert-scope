tldr: The authors analyzed the acetylcholine (ACh) content in frog muscles using mass fragmentography. They found that ACh content varied among different animals but was relatively independent of muscle mass. In denervated muscles, the ACh content decreased after two days and reached a steady value of about 26% of the control by the eighth day. The ACh concentration in non-endplate segments was not affected by denervation. This study provides insights into the distribution and changes of ACh in frog muscles under different conditions.
