tldr: The author presents evidence of a submergence of Western Europe and Mediterranean coasts at the end of the glacial period. This submergence led to the formation of rubble-drift and loess deposits, which contain the remains of land animals and shells. The author argues that these deposits provide evidence for a widespread temporary submergence accompanied by strong earth tremors.
