tldr: The article is a biographical memoir of Richard Alan Morton, a prominent biochemist who made significant contributions to the field of vitamin research. Morton's work focused on the application of spectroscopy to chemical and biological problems, particularly the study of vitamins A and D. His research led to the discovery of vitamin A2, the identification of ergosterol as a precursor of vitamin D, and the development of techniques for the oxidation of vitamins A and A2. Morton's work had a lasting impact on the understanding of vitamin function and the use of spectroscopy as a research tool in biochemistry.
