tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the effect of mineral starvation on the parasitism of the uredine fungus, Puccinia dispersa, on different species of Bromus. They found that starving the host plant of specific nutrients affected the fungus's ability to infect the plant, suggesting that the fungus's adaptability to the host plant's nutrition plays a significant role in its parasitic success.
