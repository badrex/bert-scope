tldr: The authors conducted experiments with expanding gas beams to study the formation of polymeric molecules, known as condensation embryos. They discovered that these embryos form in the cooled, supersaturated gas and play a crucial role in the condensation process. The study provides insights into the behavior of condensation nuclei and highlights interesting features of the condensation process through mass spectra analysis.
