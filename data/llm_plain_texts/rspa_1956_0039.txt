tldr: This study explores the relationship between frontogenesis and vertical circulation in meteorological fronts. The authors suggest that fronts should be considered as areas of active confluence of air currents with different temperatures. They demonstrate that frontogenesis is accompanied by a vertical circulation system that can explain several features of frontal structures, such as the upward motion of warm air and the downward motion of cold air.
