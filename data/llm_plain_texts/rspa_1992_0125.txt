tldr: The author investigates the existence of a 3-striped spiral horseshoe in driven oscillators, which represent escape from a smooth potential well under periodic forcing. By analyzing the braid of periodic orbits, the author deduces bifurcational precedences and explains significant subharmonic bifurcations observed in such systems in terms of the creation of this 3-shoe.
