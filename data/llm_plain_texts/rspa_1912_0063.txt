tldr: The authors present a general solution of Laplace's equation in spherical coordinates, suitable for problems with boundary conditions on two spherical surfaces. They apply this solution to the electrostatic field of two charged conducting spheres, deriving expressions for the capacity of each sphere. This method can be used to determine potential functions when their values are specified over any two spheres.
