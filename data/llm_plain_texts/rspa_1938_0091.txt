tldr: The authors discuss the theory of forbidden transitions in a coulomb field, focusing on β-decay processes. They analyze the matrix element and the wave functions of the particles involved, considering the integration and summation over space coordinates and spin. The study aims to understand the different orders of magnitude of the transition probability and the selection rules for total, orbital, and spin momenta.
