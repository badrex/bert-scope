tldr: The author, Lieutenant Colonel Miller, developed a new type of percussion shell that can be fired horizontally from a common gun. By improving the design of the shell, the spiral motion of the projectile can be controlled, making it more accurate and effective. The author also discusses the construction of grooved cylindrical balls and their potential for use in military applications.
