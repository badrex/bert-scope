tldr: This article discusses the relationship between seismic tomography, mantle circulation, and fluctuations in the Earth's rotation. It explores the role of irregular aspherical features of the core-mantle interface and thermal fields in the lower mantle, which affect the behavior of the main geomagnetic field on various timescales. The author emphasizes the importance of investigating the dynamical processes involved in these interactions and their geophysical consequences for understanding the Earth's deep interior.
