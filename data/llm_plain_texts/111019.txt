tldr: The author observed a beautiful Aurora Borealis event on November 17, 1848, and documented its various colors, shapes, and movements. They also noticed a great number of meteors during the event and observed a box containing a delicately balanced needle was deflected during the display. The author hypothesizes that the colors were caused by exhalations or vapor in the atmosphere, and that the moon may be connected to the red-colored auroral clouds.
