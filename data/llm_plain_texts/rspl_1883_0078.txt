tldr: The author analyzes the atomic weight of titanium using the tetrachloride compound and compares it to previous determinations. They find that titanium's atomic weight is likely a simple multiple of hydrogen's atomic weight. The author also discusses potential sources of error and plans to analyze the tetrabromide compound in a future communication.
