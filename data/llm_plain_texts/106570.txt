tldr: Sir Henry C. Englefield observed the variation of light in the star Algol using an excellent night-glass. He noticed that Algol appeared much bigger and brighter than nearby stars. The star's brightness diminished rapidly, and it became barely visible to the naked eye. Englefield's observation confirmed the accuracy of the period fixed by Mr. Goodricke for the phenomenon. This study contributed to the understanding of variable stars and their brightness changes.
