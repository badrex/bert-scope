tldr: This article discusses the properties and behavior of aluminum-tin alloys, including their melting points, solidification, and decomposition of water. The authors found that these alloys can decompose water with the evolution of hydrogen at ordinary temperatures, and the corrosion begins around the edge of the aluminum-rich areas. The microscopic structure of these alloys is also examined, showing the segregation of the aluminum-rich constituent and the eutectic mixture.
