tldr: The article discusses the speaker's linearization problem, which is the process of determining the order in which information should be expressed during speech. The author argues that this problem is not a language issue but a thought process problem. The article explores content-related and process-related principles of linearization, such as natural order, mutual knowledge, and working memory limitations, to understand how speakers organize and express their thoughts.
