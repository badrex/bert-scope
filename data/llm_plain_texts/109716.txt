tldr: This article discusses experiments conducted by B. C. Brodie on the relationship between the brain and heart action, as well as the generation of animal heat. Brodie found that the brain is not directly necessary for heart action, and the circulation of blood ceases due to the suspension of respiration. He also discovered that respiration tends to cool the body rather than support animal heat.
