revised_title: 'The Effect of Carbohydrates and Neutralizing Agents on Nitrogen Fixation by Aerobic Organisms'

tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the most effective carbohydrates and neutralizing agents for nitrogen fixation by aerobic organisms, specifically Azotobacter and Pseudomonas. They found that dextrin is an efficient source of energy for both organisms, and basic slag is an effective neutralizing agent that also increases nitrogen fixation. A simple nutrient medium for both organisms is achieved by adding dextrin, di-potassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate, and basic slag to distilled water.
