tldr: This study measures the rotational structure of seven vibration bands of nitrous oxide and derives molecular rotational constants. The results show that vibrational interactions may lead to variations in molecular constants, which affects the determination of the location of a particular band. The study provides further values for rotational constants and more information about possible vibrational interactions.
