tldr: The authors apply the theory of continuous distributions of dislocations to study the geometrical features of twisting in a cylindrical crystal deforming by single glide. They derive expressions for shape changes, lattice rotations, and dislocation distribution, and compare their findings with experimental observations and previous theoretical work. The study provides insights into the deformation process and helps understand the behavior of materials under stress.
