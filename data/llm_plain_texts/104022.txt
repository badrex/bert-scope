tldr: The author, John Maud, conducted an experiment to demonstrate the phenomenon of inflammable air. He collected this air from the reaction between iron filings, oil of vitriol, and water. Maud suggested that a similar chemical reaction could occur within the Earth, leading to the release of elastic, inflammable air, which could cause earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.
