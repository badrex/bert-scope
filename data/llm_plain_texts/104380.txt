tldr: A woman named Sarah McKinna experienced a unique pregnancy case where she had a caesarian operation performed by an untrained butcher. The butcher extracted a full skeleton of a child along with some pieces of putrefied flesh. The woman survived the operation, but suffered from a navel rupture. The story also includes another case of a man named William Clark who lived with ossified joints for 38 years before passing away. His skeleton was studied by Dr. Barry, a physician from Cork.
