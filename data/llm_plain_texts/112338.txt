tldr: The author, J.J. Sylvester, introduces new theorems on the degree and weight of resultants in a multipartite system of equations. He explains the conditions for a resultant to exist and the concept of weight in relation to variables and sets. The theorems apply to various cases, including linear and polynomial equations.
