tldr: 'Satellite tracking of brent geese during their migration across the Greenland ice-cap revealed that the birds faced significant challenges in terms of flight and orientation performance. The geese had limited climbing rates, indicating size-dependent power limitations. Their flight tracks were irregular, suggesting a combination of landmark piloting and a compass mechanism for orientation. This study provides insights into the challenges birds face during extreme migrations and the strategies they use to navigate complex environments.'
