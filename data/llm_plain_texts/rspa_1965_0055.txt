tldr: The authors measured the acoustic impedance of liquid helium-3 in the temperature range of 0.05 to 1.3 Kelvin. They found that the acoustic impedance increased abruptly at around 0.3 Kelvin, which is in good agreement with Landau's theory of a Fermi liquid. This theory explains the change in impedance due to the propagation of a new mode of sound called "zero-sound."
