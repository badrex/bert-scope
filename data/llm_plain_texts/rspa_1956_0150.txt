tldr: The authors explore the concept of dislocation density and shape strain in deformed crystals. They introduce a metric to measure distances in the dislocated state and discuss the implications of using a metric with a specific connection. The study focuses on the compatibility equations for finite strains and the relationship between dislocation density and shape strain in crystals.
