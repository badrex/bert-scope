tldr: This article discusses Joseph Larmor's significant contributions to electromagnetic theory and the introduction of the electron. Larmor's work built upon the foundation laid by James Clerk Maxwell and helped establish a research school in Cambridge. Larmor's Electronic Theory of Matter, which proposed that the universe consists of a sea of ether populated by positive and negative electrons, rendered much of the Maxwellian physics of the time obsolete. The theory also led Larmor to explain the null result obtained in the Michelson-Morley ether drift experiment, providing evidence in support of his theory.
