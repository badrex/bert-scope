tldr: This article investigates the role of cephalopods in the diets of various seal species, finding that while most seals consume cephalopods, no species specializes entirely on them. The most common cephalopod taxa consumed by seals include members of the Loliginidae, Ommastrephidae, Onychoteuthidae, Gonatidae, and benthic octopods. The study highlights the importance of cephalopods as prey for seals and their impact on marine ecosystems.
