tldr: The author investigates the electronic properties of dilute synthetic metals created by intercalation of electron acceptor molecules between the carbon hexagon networks of well-oriented graphite. They determine resistivities and Hall coefficients for graphite bisulphates and, to a lesser extent, graphite perchlorates. The author finds peak anomalies in Hall effects at around 20 K, which they discuss in relation to possible changes in the structure of the intercalate layers with temperature.
