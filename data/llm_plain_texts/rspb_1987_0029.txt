tldr: The study investigates the microvasculature of brain and muscle in the cuttlefish Sepia officinalis, providing information about the surface area for exchange at the blood-tissue interface. The microvessel density, length, dimensions, and volume fraction were estimated, revealing that brain and valve muscle are unlikely to be hypoxic under physiological conditions, while tentacle muscle may be. This research offers a detailed analysis of the microvasculature in a complex invertebrate, allowing for useful comparisons with vertebrate tissues.
