tldr: The authors conducted experiments on frogs to study the function of utricular maculae and semicircular canals in maintaining balance. They found that damage to the utriculus causes a persistent leaning of the head and spinal torque, suggesting that these structures are adapted to respond to gravity. Further research is needed to understand their inner mechanisms and how they operate.
