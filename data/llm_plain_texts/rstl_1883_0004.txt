tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the value of the British Association unit of resistance using a modified Wheatstone bridge and two coils. They measured the resistance of the secondary circuit and the galvanometer, and found a value for the unit. The experiments aimed to improve the accuracy of resistance measurements and provide a more reliable standard for future research.
