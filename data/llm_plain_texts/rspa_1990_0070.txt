tldr: This study investigates the combustion of a single fuel droplet near a cold surface, focusing on factors such as burning rate, flame shape, flame temperature, soot formation, and fuel vapor condensation on the surface. The experiments were conducted with a consistent fuel (n-heptane), initial droplet volume, ambient temperature, and pressure, while varying the distance between the droplet and the surface. The results showed that the droplet burning rate decreased as it was brought closer to the surface, and the burning rate of a droplet adjacent to a vertical surface was larger than for a horizontal surface. The extent of sooting and fuel vapor condensation on the surface were also affected by the proximity of the droplet to the surface.
