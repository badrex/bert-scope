tldr: The authors propose a synaptic mechanism that may underlie the directional selectivity to motion in the nervous system. They suggest that a specific interaction between two inputs, after asymmetric low-pass or delay operations, can explain the basic principles of movement detection. The proposed mechanism involves a patch of dendritic membrane receiving two distinct inputs through two adjacent synapses, which control conductances and depolarize the membrane. The authors demonstrate that this circuit can subserve direction selectivity and perform a multiplication-like operation.
