tldr: This study investigates the friction and transfer of various thermoplastics when sliding over clean surfaces. It is found that polymers with smooth molecular profiles, like PTFE, exhibit lower friction and transfer compared to those with bulky side groups. The results suggest that the frictional behavior of thermoplastics is influenced by their molecular structure, with smooth profiles leading to lower friction and transfer.
