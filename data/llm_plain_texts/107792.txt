tldr: The author, Charles Rumker, conducted astronomical observations at the Paramatta Observatory in New South Wales, focusing on the study of the solar eclipse and the determination of geographical positions. He used various instruments and methods, including micrometrical measurements, to calculate the longitude and latitude of the observatory and the surrounding area. These observations and calculations were valuable for understanding the astronomical phenomena and improving the accuracy of geographical data in the Southern Hemisphere.
