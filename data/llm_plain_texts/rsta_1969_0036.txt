tldr: This article investigates the structure and motion of free vertical shear layers in a rotating fluid, focusing on the dynamics of a slowly rising body. The authors explore three cases of axially bounded motion, including the split disk, rising disk, and rising sphere. They introduce an hypothesis to limit the strength of singularities in the layer solutions and discuss the implications of this hypothesis on the structure of the Stewartson layers.
