tldr: The article discusses the role of the inferior temporal cortex in processing and storing visual information about form and color in primates. It reviews the properties of inferior temporal neurons and explores how these properties may underlie perceptual and mnemonic functions of the cortex. The study also examines the processing of facial images by the inferior temporal cortex and the representation of faces and other complex visual stimuli by the pattern of responses over a population of neurons.
