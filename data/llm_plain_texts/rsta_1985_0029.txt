tldr: This article explores the molecular changes in sediment lipids as indicators of systematic early diagenesis. It focuses on the transformations of steroidal hydrocarbons in sedimentary sequences and how these changes can be used to assess the thermal history of sediments during the early diagenesis stage. The study examines the depth trends of selected diagenetic reactions and their potential value in understanding the depositional history of sediment sequences.
