tldr: This article investigates the Taylor-vortex flow between two concentric cylinders of finite length using amplitude equations. The study shows that the bifurcation to Taylor-vortex flow is supercritical rather than transcritical, and discusses the relevance of this finding for comparison with observations. The research also develops an expansion theory based on the adjoint theory of partial differential equations to better understand the phenomena.
