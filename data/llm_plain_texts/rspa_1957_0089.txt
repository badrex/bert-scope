revised_title: 'Determination of Aluminium Band Structure from Experimental Data'
semantic_tags:
  - Band structure
  - Aluminium
  - De Haas-van Alphen effect
  - Anomalous skin effect
  - Low-temperature specific heat
tldr: The authors used experimental data from the de Haas-van Alphen effect and the anomalous skin effect to determine the band structure of aluminium. They found that the first zone is filled with electrons, and there is an overflow of electrons into the second zone. The results were confirmed by a more accurate theoretical band-structure calculation.
