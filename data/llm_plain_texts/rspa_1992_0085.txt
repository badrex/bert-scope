tldr: The authors examine the evolution of a reaction-diffusion equation in isothermal chemical autocatalysis when a localized input of an autocatalyst is introduced into an expanse of a reactant. They study the initial-boundary-value problem and its long-time development, finding that the fully reacted state is not achieved through the propagation of a traveling wave-front but is approached uniformly in space as time increases.
