tldr: The author investigates the non-unique solutions in thermoelectric magnetohydrodynamic heat convection, focusing on a spherical container with a conducting wall. The study reveals multiple non-uniqueness, bifurcation, and catastrophe-type behavior when the problem is specified in terms of known heat transfer rates. The findings have implications for liquid lithium cells in fusion reactor blankets and potential experimental applications.
