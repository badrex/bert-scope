tldr: The authors studied the stability of viscous flow between rotating concentric cylinders with an axial flow. They found that for axial Reynolds numbers of about ninety, a second mode of instability arises, and there is a discontinuity in the axial wavenumber of the critical disturbance as a function of the Reynolds number. The results show that the small-gap problem is a valid approximation to the problem for near 1, and that the approximation of the axial velocity by its average value leads to qualitatively and quantitatively incorrect results.
