tldr: This article discusses the concept of controlling optical bistability using a guided wave in a nonlinear Fabry-Perot etalon. The authors demonstrate how this can be used for optical signal processing and basic logic operations. They present experimental results using an InSb etalon and a CO laser, showing the potential for applications in optical signal processing.
