tldr: This article discusses the concept of hybrid vigor or heterosis in mice. It examines the differences in variance between inbred strains and their crosses, and how heterosis can affect the vigor and reproductive behavior of the animals. The author also suggests that further research on the early stages of growth and germination may help reveal the mode of action of heterosis in species.
