tldr: The authors investigate unsteady marginal separations and abrupt turbulent reattachment in fluid dynamics, specifically in aerofoil flow. They study the properties of unsteady marginal laminar separation and its role in the transition to turbulent reattachment following laminar separation near the leading edge of an aerofoil. The research has implications for understanding dynamic stall, which occurs on slowly oscillating aerofoils and turbine and helicopter blades.
