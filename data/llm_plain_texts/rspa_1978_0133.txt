tldr: The authors measured oscillator strengths of 134 lines from the ground term of neutral titanium using the hook method in a high-temperature furnace. Their data, normalized to Bell, Kalman & Tubbs' work, indicates a line strength-dependent error in the National Bureau of Standards compilation of Ti 1f-values by Wiese & Fuhr. This study provides new values in the ultraviolet wavelength region where the data of Wiese & Fuhr (1975) are limited.
