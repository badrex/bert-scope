tldr: This article investigates the impact of residual elements on the elevated temperature properties of creep-resistant steels. It examines the effects of elements like boron, nitrogen, phosphorus, and molybdenum on the steel's creep rupture life, ductility, and secondary creep rate. The study finds that boron and nitrogen improve creep strength, while phosphorus and molybdenum have varying effects on the steel's properties. The research supports the idea that residual elements can significantly influence the performance of creep-resistant steels at high temperatures.
