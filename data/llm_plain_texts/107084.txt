tldr: The author describes a case study of a patient suffering from severe spasms in the thumb and forefinger. The spasms were traced to irritation in the median nerve, and the patient consented to have the nerve divided to stop the progress of the irritation. The operation was successful, and the patient eventually recovered, with the spasms no longer affecting the brain. This case study highlights the potential for surgical intervention in treating nerve-related disorders.
