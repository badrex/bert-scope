tldr: The authors used infrared diode laser spectroscopy to study the v3 band of NF2 free radicals and ions. They derived rotational, distortion, and fine structure parameters for the l-level and investigated the Coriolis coupling of the and modes. This research provides insights into the molecular structure and interactions of NF2 molecules.
