tldr: 'This study investigates the behavior of particles around two fixed black holes, focusing on periodic orbits and chaos. The research discovers that most orbits are chaotic, but ordered motions around stable periodic orbits exist. The orbits that fall into the black holes are separated by unstable periodic orbits. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the dynamics in two-black-hole systems.'
