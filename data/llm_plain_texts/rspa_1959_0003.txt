tldr: This article presents a calculation of the lifetimes of excess electrons and holes in semiconductors, assuming the Auger effect between bands (electron-electron and hole-hole collisions) to be the only recombination mechanism. The authors find that the Auger effect is more significant in semiconductors with smaller energy gaps and can dominate radiative recombination. The theory is compared with experimental lifetimes in InSb, showing that the Auger mechanism may explain the observed lifetimes in the material.
