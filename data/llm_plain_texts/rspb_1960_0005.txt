tldr: The authors conducted experiments using synthetic speech to study how the perception of vowel sounds changes based on the context of the surrounding speech. They found that the acoustic structure of a sentence can alter the perception of a succeeding vowel sound, suggesting that an adaptation level for vowels is formed when listening to a particular speaker. The results support the adaptation level theory, which states that responses to stimuli are influenced by the context and previous experiences.
