tldr: The authors develop a thermodynamic theory for black holes and apply it to the Kerr-Newman family of black holes. They find that black holes undergo a phase transition at a certain point, and above this transition, the specific heat is positive, allowing for isothermal equilibrium with a surrounding heat bath. The authors also investigate processes and stability criteria for various black hole situations and discuss the limits for entropically favored black hole formation.
