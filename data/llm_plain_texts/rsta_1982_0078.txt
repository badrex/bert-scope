tldr: This article discusses the methods used to model the Earth's core magnetic field. The authors analyze data collected by the Magsat satellite and propose a model that separates the core and crustal portions of the Earth's magnetic field. They suggest that a better model of the core field can be found by modeling it with non-central sources, such as current loops located within the core.
