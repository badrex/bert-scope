tldr: The author investigated the use of electricity to dissolve urinary calculi in dilute saline fluids. They found that the galvanic battery had a more significant effect on uric acid calculi than oxalate of lime calculi. The study concluded that the method could dissolve varying amounts of different types of calculi, providing a potential treatment option.
