tldr: The authors apply the gas-solid virial expansion method to study argon absorbed on the (100) face of sodium chloride. They determine the second two-dimensional virial coefficient and analyze the effects of perturbation terms, three-body interactions, and surface structure on the adsorption process. The results suggest a larger attractive gas-crystal interaction than previously thought.
