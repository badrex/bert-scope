tldr: This article presents a simple proof using Hermitian matrices to demonstrate that the group of self-transformations of Minkowski space, which preserves causality, is the orthochronous inhomogeneous Lorentz group with dilations. The author applies a theorem from 1949 to this representation, leading to Zeeman's theorem, which states that the most general point transformation of Minkowski space that preserves causality is the eleven-parameter group G generated by orthochronous Lorentz transformations, translations, and dilations.
