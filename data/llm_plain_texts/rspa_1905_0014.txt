tldr: 'This study conducted in the Arctic region investigated the potential gradient, dissipation, ionization, and radioactivity in the atmosphere. The yearly course of the potential gradient followed the general rule for the Northern Hemisphere, while the dissipation and ionization showed daily and yearly variations. The study found that low values of ionization and dissipation were accompanied by high values of the potential gradient, and vice versa. The radioactivity had a distinct yearly and daily course, with a connection to meteorological conditions. The research supported the theory that the source of radio-active emanation in the atmosphere is the soil of the ground.'
