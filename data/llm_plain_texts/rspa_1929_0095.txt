  - Magnetostriction

tldr: This article explores the phenomena of magnetostriction and the Curie point through Heisenberg's theory of ferromagnetism. The authors explain how the exchange effects in Heisenberg's theory can account for the changes in volume at the Curie point and magnetostriction, which are too large to be explained by magnetic forces alone. They also discuss the partition function and its relation to the size of the metal and magnetization, providing a theoretical explanation for these effects.
