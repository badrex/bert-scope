tldr: The authors conducted an experiment to study the passage of neutrons through heavy water. They used a sealed flask containing 96 grams of 98% pure heavy water and exposed it to neutrons for twenty minutes. The results showed that heavy water effectively slowed down the neutrons, which could have implications for nuclear reactors.
