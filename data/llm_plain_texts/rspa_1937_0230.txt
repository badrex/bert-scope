tldr: The author presents a method to calculate the torsion of conical shells, generalizing the Bredt-Batho formula. The solution considers the shear stress and torque, and the twist can be calculated without difficulty. The author also discusses the warping of cross-sections in cylindrical tubes and conical shells.
