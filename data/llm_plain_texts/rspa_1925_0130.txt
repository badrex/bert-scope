tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the stress-optical effect in overstrained celluloid and found that the residual double refraction increases with permanent elongation, contrary to previous findings. They also discovered that the stress-optical coefficient of the celluloid changes with the bending moment, which affects the double refraction. This study provides a better understanding of celluloid models for exploring stresses in engineering structures.
