tldr: The authors observed collateral and ultraterminal sprouting by both skeletomotor and fusimotor axons in healthy and de-afferentated mammalian skeletal muscles. They suggest that motor endings may have a limited lifespan and be periodically replaced by collateral regeneration in normal muscle. This process could be a general property of the vertebrate motoneuron for its peripheral terminals to undergo cyclic renewal.
