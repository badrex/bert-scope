tldr: The author analyzes magnetic observations from York Fort in Hudson's Bay and discusses the reversal of magnetic declination. They also revisit Halley's hypothesis, which explains the complex phenomena of magnetic direction using a double system of terrestrial magnetic forces and two poles in each hemisphere. The author believes that the reversal of the isogonic lines in America supports Halley's hypothesis.
