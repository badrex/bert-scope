tldr: The authors isolated and studied mutants of Escherichia coli K12 that lacked phosphopyruvate synthase activity. They used interrupted mating and selection procedures to locate the gene responsible for this activity on the bacterial genome. The findings provide insights into the anaplerotic pathway and the role of phosphopyruvate synthase in cellular synthesis.
