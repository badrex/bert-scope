tldr: The author applies the principle of virtual dissipation to fluid mixtures with thermomolecular diffusion, deriving the fluid dynamical equations of the continuum and Lagrangian equations using a variational procedure. This new approach provides a powerful tool for analyzing complex systems and developing finite element methods, with concepts and results distinct from other schools of thought.
