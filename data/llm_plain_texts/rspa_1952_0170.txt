tldr: This article explores the relationship between Eddington's E-numbers and tensor transformation theory. The author demonstrates that E-numbers undergo transformations that are different from standard tensor transformations but still satisfy the general conditions that characterize tensor transformations. This extension of tensor transformation theory introduces a new class of tensors that must be included in a complete tensor theory.
