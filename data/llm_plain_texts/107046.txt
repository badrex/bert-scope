tldr: The author, William Herschel, investigates the power of telescopes in comparison to natural vision. He examines the nature of luminous bodies and the method of vision at a distance, considering the differences between self-luminous and non-self-luminous objects. The study also explores the effects of light transmission through telescopes and the impact of aperture size on vision.
