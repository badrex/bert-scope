tldr: This article discusses the antibiotic activity of growth factor analogues and their potential in chemotherapy. The author explains how altering the structure of a growth factor can inhibit bacterial growth by blocking enzyme processes necessary for bacterial protein synthesis. However, the author also highlights the challenges in designing effective analogues due to the delicate balance of competitive reactions and the lack of knowledge about growth factor concentrations in the blood.
