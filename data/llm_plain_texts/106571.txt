tldr: A farmer named Palitch observed the obscuration of the star Algol on multiple occasions. The star's brightness diminished to nearly the size of a fourth magnitude star and then gradually increased, recovering its usual brilliancy. The estimated period of this phenomenon was 2 days, 20 hours, and 53 minutes. This observation was communicated by Count de Bruhl to Sir Joseph Banks.
