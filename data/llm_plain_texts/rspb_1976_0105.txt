tldr: The article discusses the potential of immunization against pregnancy using antibodies to block the luteotrophic support of the corpus luteum and affect the placenta or developing fetus. Active immunization in marmosets suppresses fertility for about a year, while passive immunization has short-lived effects. The authors suggest that further research is needed to develop synthetic polypeptide fractions and conjugation of purified fractions to non-toxic adjuvants for human immunization.
