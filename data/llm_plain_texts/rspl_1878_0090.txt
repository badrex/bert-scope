tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the velocities of normal propagation of plane waves in a biaxal crystal and compared the results with Fresnel's theory. They found that the experimental values deviated from the theoretical predictions, with the differences increasing as they approached the major axis. This study aimed to test and refine the understanding of wave propagation in crystals.
