tldr: The authors used advanced electron microscopy techniques to study the surface of motor neurons in detail. They discovered that motor neurons have a large number of terminal boutons, or end-feet, covering most of their surface. These end-feet are in close contact with the neuron's surface and contain numerous mitochondria and other granules. The findings provide new insights into the structure and function of motor neurons and their connections with other cells in the nervous system.
