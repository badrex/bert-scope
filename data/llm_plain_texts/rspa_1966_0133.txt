tldr: This article presents an expansion method for calculating atomic properties, focusing on the correlation energies of the lithium sequence. The authors demonstrate that this method can yield results superior to the Hartree-Fock approximation. They evaluate the correlation energy for the lithium sequence and show that most of the correlation energy arises from pair energies. The non-relativistic eigenvalues for the lithium sequence are given, and the accuracy of the method is compared to experimental values.
