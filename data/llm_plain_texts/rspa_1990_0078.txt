tldr: This article investigates the nonlinear development of wave growth in a boundary layer, leading to chaotic motion and turbulence. The study uses a combination of artificial and natural disturbances to excite the flow and measure the amplification and propagation of unstable waves. The findings provide insight into the mechanics of chaotic motion and the transition to turbulence in open flow geometries, such as boundary layers.
