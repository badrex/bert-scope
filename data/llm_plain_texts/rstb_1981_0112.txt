tldr: This article explores the interaction between platelets and vessel walls in the process of blood clotting. It demonstrates that thrombin formation is necessary for platelet response to vessel wall damage and that prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) inhibits coagulation induced by damaged vascular tissue. The study also highlights the importance of vessel wall-induced clotting in both haemostasis and thrombosis.
