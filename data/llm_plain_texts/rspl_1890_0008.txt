tldr: The author, G. J. Symons, examines barometric oscillations during thunderstorms and the brontometer, an instrument designed to study these oscillations. He discusses various explanations for the rise in barometric pressure during thunderstorms, including ascensional air currents, local compression of air by raindrops, and temperature changes. The author also presents examples of barometric records from different locations and observations by other scientists, highlighting the need for further research to determine the cause of these oscillations.
