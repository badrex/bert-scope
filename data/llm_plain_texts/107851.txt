tldr: The author, Samuel Hunter Christie, conducted experiments to study the deviation of magnetized needles due to the presence of iron. He discovered a simple law that explains the deviations and tested it through various experiments. The findings of this study can be used to improve our understanding of magnetism and its applications.
