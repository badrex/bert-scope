tldr: This study examines the resonance behavior of a model mammalian neuron in response to periodic external currents. The authors find that the neuron can resonate at a specific frequency, driving it into continuous bursting. This resonance could play a role in synaptic transmission at relay nuclei in the mammalian brain.
