tldr: The authors studied the microwave rotational spectrum of trimethylene sulfide and determined the molecular structure, including the tilt, bend, and twist of the 2-methylene group. Their findings provide a unique opportunity to test a model for small angular distortions of methylene groups in four-membered rings containing a heteroatom. The research also establishes the existence of a tilt and bend of the 3-methylene group.
