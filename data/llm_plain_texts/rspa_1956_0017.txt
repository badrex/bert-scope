tldr: This article presents a theoretical analysis of the initial behavior of a spherical explosion, considering a more general equation of state for both the explosive gas and the surrounding medium. The study expands on previous work by Berry and Holt (1954) to provide a more accurate representation of real-world scenarios. The research demonstrates that the second shock wave is a second-order effect in terms of the square root of the time from detonation, contradicting earlier conclusions by Wecken (1951).
