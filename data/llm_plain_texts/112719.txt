tldr: The authors conducted research on the reaction between codeia and hydrochloric acid, resulting in the formation of a new base called chlorocodide. They described the process of obtaining the new base, its properties, and its comparative physiological action with other opium alkaloids. The study highlights the influence of mass on chemical reactions and provides insights into the constitution of opium bases.
