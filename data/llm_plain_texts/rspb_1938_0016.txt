tldr: 'This study investigates the effect of alternating periods of light and darkness on the growth of Lemna minor. The research found that plants grown under continuous light had a higher growth rate, frond division, and dry weight compared to those under alternating light and dark periods. The study also discovered that stomatal closure was not the cause of the slower growth rate in Lemna minor, as its stomata appeared to be inoperative.'
