tldr: The authors discuss the principles of circular dichroism and its application to helical polymers. They focus on the electrostatic coupling between electronic transitions in polymers and its impact on optical rotation. The study of circular dichroism can help measure the 'helical content' of polypeptides and detect structural changes in complex proteins.
