tldr: The author evaluates the first-order density cluster integral in the radial distribution function for various intermolecular potentials, including the hard-sphere, square-well, and Lennard-Jones potentials. The study provides relationships between the second virial coefficient and X-ray scattering data, as well as a method to deduce pair potentials at large separations from scattering data and the second virial coefficient.
