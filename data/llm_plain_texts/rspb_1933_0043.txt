tldr: The authors investigated the effects of hydrocyanic acid, iodo-acetic acid, and sodium fluoride on the metabolism and transplantability of cancer cells. They found that these inhibitors have varying degrees of effectiveness in checking the respiration and glycolysis of tumor tissue, and the degree of reversibility of their action. The study also showed that the viability of the treated cells, as measured by their ability to be transplanted, is related to the extent of the metabolic recovery.
