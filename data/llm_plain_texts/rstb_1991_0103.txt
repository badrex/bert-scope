tldr: The article presents a mathematical model for calculating carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb) levels in human blood as a function of exposure time and ambient CO concentration. The model takes into account molecular diffusion, convection, facilitated diffusion, and non-equilibrium kinetics of CO with haemoglobin. The results show that the COHb levels computed from the model are in good agreement with experimental values, and the model provides a better approximation compared to other models.
