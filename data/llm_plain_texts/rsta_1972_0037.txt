tldr: The authors study the sedimentation patterns and subsidence in the inner Thames estuary, identifying two zones with different sedimentation processes. The upper zone is dominated by deposition from fluid mud, while the lower zone is influenced by bed-traction. The estuary acts as a sediment trap, with the limits set by the salinity gradient and the balance between sediment supply and loss. The authors also discuss the impact of regional subsidence on the estuary's sedimentation processes.
