tldr: The phylogenetic regression is a new statistical method that applies multiple regression techniques to cross-species data, allowing continuous and categorical variables to be tested for and controlled for. This method takes into account the non-independence of species due to recognized and unrecognized phylogeny, making it valid for use when information about the phylogeny is incomplete. The method uses a working phylogeny to represent the relationships between species and applies the radiation principle to account for unrecognized phylogeny.
