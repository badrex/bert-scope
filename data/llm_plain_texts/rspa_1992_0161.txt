  - Centroidal Frames
tldr: The article explores the dynamics of point vortices, a Hamiltonian system, and introduces a new class of centroidal frames that decompose the motion into group and relative components without restrictions on perturbations. The effectiveness of centroidal frames is demonstrated through the study of periodic, quasi-periodic, and chaotic motions of point vortices.
