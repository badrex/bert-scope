tldr: The author presents a new method for estimating the amylolytic and proteolytic activity of pancreatic extracts. The method involves measuring the amount of starch mucilage transformed by a unit measure of diastasic solution to the point where it no longer gives a color reaction with iodine. The author also discusses the importance of quantity and time factors in enzyme action and suggests that enzymes, like pancreatic diastase, have a progressively retarded rate of energy release.
