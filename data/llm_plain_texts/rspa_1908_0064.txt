tldr: The author presents a detailed analysis of the processes operative in solutions, focusing on the interaction of substances with water and the formation of composite electrolytes. They propose a new understanding of the nature of dissolution, emphasizing the role of water's complex molecular structure and the importance of considering both the solute and solvent in electrolytes. The author also discusses the relationship between concentration and electrolytic conductivity, challenging the conventional conception of molecular conductivity.
