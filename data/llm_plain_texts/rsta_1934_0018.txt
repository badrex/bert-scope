tldr: The authors investigate the solvation and sorption of nitrocellulose in acetone-water mixtures, finding that the solvation process is essential for the solution of nitrocellulose. They also discover that the critical solution concentrations of nitrocellulose rise with an increase in nitrogen content and viscosity. The study provides insights into the solvation process and its impact on the solubility of nitrocellulose in different acetone-water mixtures.
