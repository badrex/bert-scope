  - Colloidal suspensions
  - Electrolytes
  - Sound waves
  - Electrical potential differences
  - Double-layer thickness
tldr: The article examines the electrical effects that occur when sound waves propagate through a suspension of charged colloidal particles in an electrolyte. It shows that potential differences arise between different points in the wave train due to the asymmetry of the double-layer surrounding the particles. The results indicate that the amplitude of the potential difference decreases with increasing concentration of electrolyte and is independent of the sound wave frequency, except at very high frequencies.
