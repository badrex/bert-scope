tldr: In 1821, a cave in Kirkdale, Yorkshire, revealed a collection of fossilized teeth and bones of various animals, including elephant, rhinoceros, hippopotamus, bear, tiger, and hyena. The author, William Buckland, analyzed the remains and concluded that the cave was once a den for hyenas, which brought in the bones of other animals. The fossils were found in a layer of mud and stalagmite formations, suggesting that they were from a time before the last great flood or deluge. This discovery provided evidence of extinct species and helped to understand the geological history of the region.
