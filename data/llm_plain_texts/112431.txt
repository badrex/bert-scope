tldr: The author, Charles Chambers, conducted observations of the absolute direction and intensity of terrestrial magnetism at Bombay using instruments supplied by the Kew Committee of the British Association. The observations were taken from April 29, 1867, to December 29, 1868, and included measurements of dip, declination, and the horizontal component of the force. The results showed that the dip was increasing, and the author estimated the rate of annual change. The observations also revealed differences in the indications of the two needles, which were further investigated in a separate communication.
