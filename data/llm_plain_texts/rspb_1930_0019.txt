tldr: The author conducted experiments using tissue culture to study the movement of cells from a fragment of chick spleen in vitro. They discovered that cells migrated towards substances with a concentration gradient, suggesting the presence of a unidirectional directive force. This research provided insights into the understanding of cell movement and chemotaxis.
