tldr: The article discusses the biochemical functions of terpenoids in plants, focusing on the possible role of xanthoxin in plant growth and development. Xanthoxin, a potent growth regulator, has regulatory functions different from abscisic acid. The author explores the role of xanthoxin in various plant processes, such as root branching, abscission, and light-induced growth. The article also highlights the challenges in detecting and estimating xanthoxin in plant extracts and the potential role of xanthoxin in light-induced growth processes.
