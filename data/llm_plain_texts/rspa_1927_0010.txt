tldr: The authors study the equilibrium of heterogeneous systems, including electrolytes, and focus on the equilibrium at interfaces. They explore the concepts of electrocapillarity and the effects of electric fields on surface tension and adsorption. The research provides a deeper understanding of the behavior of charged interfaces and the role of ions in the process.
