tldr: This study examines the process of meiosis in Oenothera purpurata and Oe. blandina, two plants with seven pairs of chromosomes. The research focuses on the stages of pollen meiosis and the origin of chromosome linkage. The authors find that the number and size of dense bodies in the nucleus do not have a significant role in chromosome pairing. They also provide evidence supporting the parasynaptic hypothesis for chromosome pairing in Oenothera, which is in line with other forms. The study contributes to the understanding of meiosis and chromosome behavior in these plants.
