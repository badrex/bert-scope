tldr: The author, William Crookes, developed a new spectrum-microscope that overcomes several disadvantages of the traditional spectrum-microscope. The new design allows for binocular vision, easier adjustments, and better dispersion, making it easier to examine the spectra of small objects like blood corpuscles. The instrument can also be used with polarized light and dichroic substances.
