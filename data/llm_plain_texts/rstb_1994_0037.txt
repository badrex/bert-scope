tldr: 'The article describes the physicochemical and biological characterizations of distinct strains of the transmissible mink encephalopathy agent. The authors identify two strains, hyper (hy) and drowsy (die), with different biological properties and disease-specific prion proteins (PrPâ„¢) having distinct physicochemical properties. The study highlights the importance of the transmissible agent in determining the outcome of infection by prions and suggests that the different disease expressions may be due to post-translational mechanisms of the prion proteins.'
