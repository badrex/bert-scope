tldr: The authors conducted a detailed analysis of the crystal and molecular structure of perylene using three-dimensional intensity data. They found that the molecule has small deviations from a completely planar arrangement due to intermolecular steric effects. The mean bond distances agree closely with valence bond and molecular orbital calculations. The peri-bond lengths are longer than expected, suggesting that the peri-bonds are single bonds and that aromatic character is localized within each naphthalene residue.
