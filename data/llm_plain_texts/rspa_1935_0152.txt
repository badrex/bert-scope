tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the specific heat of a supraconducting alloy and found that there was no appreciable discontinuity in the specific heat at the transition point. This result challenges Rutgers's formula, which cannot be applied in its simple form to this type of alloy. The authors propose possible explanations for this discrepancy and suggest further magnetic and thermal investigations on alloys to determine the validity of these explanations.
