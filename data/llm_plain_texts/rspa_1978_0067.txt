tldr: The authors conducted mass spectrometric and mobility studies on the positive ions in a flame to analyze the flame ionization detector used in gas chromatography. They discovered that at high concentrations, the charge is carried by a group of ions, while at low concentrations, a second group of ions becomes comparable in number. This alters the electrical characteristics of the detector but does not affect its linearity.
