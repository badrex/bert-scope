tldr: The authors studied the reflection of X-rays from anthracene crystals to analyze their crystal structure. They found that the efficiency of reflection depends on the crystal's structure and the angle of incidence. The results provide insights into the behavior of X-rays when interacting with crystals and contribute to the understanding of crystallography and quantum mechanics.
