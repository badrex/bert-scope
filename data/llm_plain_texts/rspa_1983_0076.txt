tldr: The authors developed a method to generate possible crystal structures of primary amides by constructing the ways in which the molecules can pack. They analyzed the favorable and unfavorable features of the molecular arrangements, focusing on close packing principles, molecular symmetry, and the size and shape of the amide residue group. This study helps in understanding the factors that determine the molecular architecture of the solid state.
