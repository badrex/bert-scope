tldr: The authors develop a formal theory of correlation dimension for a class of stationary time series, including deterministic outputs and Gaussian processes with continuous paths. This theory enables the analysis of correlation dimension in Gaussian processes through spectral methods. The study re-examines the behavior of Gaussian power-law colored noise and demonstrates that the finite correlation dimension observed by previous researchers is a local quantity due to the non-ergodicity of the simulation model.
