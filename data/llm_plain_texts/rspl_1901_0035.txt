tldr: This article discusses the chilling experiments conducted on copper-tin alloys to study their properties and behavior during solidification. The authors observed remarkable changes in the alloys' patterns and structures, providing insights into their composition and mechanical properties. The experiments involved cooling the alloys at different temperatures and examining their microstructures using a microscope, which helped in understanding the complex nature of these alloys.
