tldr: The authors, N. V. Sidgwick and H. M. Powell, explore the stereochemical types and valency groups in chemistry. They discuss the arrangement of covalencies in polyvalent atoms and how these arrangements are influenced by the size of the valency group and the number of shared electrons. The authors also examine the structures of molecules and the methods used to determine their relative positions in space, such as X-ray diffraction, absorption spectra, and Raman spectra.
