tldr: The authors studied the electric activity at the nerve-muscle junction and discovered that the nerve impulse releases acetylcholine, which depolarizes the muscle fiber's end-plate. This local depolarization, called the end-plate potential, triggers a new impulse in the muscle fiber. The mechanism of the end-plate potential is different from the one associated with spike activity, as it is induced by acetylcholine and involves a membrane short-circuit, leading to depolarization.
