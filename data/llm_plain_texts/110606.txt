tldr: The author conducted experiments on blood and respiration, discovering that blood can absorb oxygen from both atmospheric air and oxygen gas. They found that arterial and venous blood become darker and serum becomes more liquid when saturated with carbonic acid gas. The author also observed that the absorption of oxygen by blood increases its temperature.
