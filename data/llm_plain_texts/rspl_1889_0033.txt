tldr: This article by J. A. Ewing investigates the time-lag in the magnetization of iron and the creeping up of magnetism after changes in magnetic force. Ewing uses a magnetometer and a compensating coil to study the effects of magnetization on soft iron. The results show that the initial magnetic susceptibility is high, but decreases over time, and that the settling of iron into a new magnetic state is not instantaneous.
