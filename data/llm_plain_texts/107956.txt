tldr: In this article, Michael Faraday conducts experiments to study the effects of electric currents and their induction. He discovers that when a magnetic field changes near a conductor, an electromotive force is induced in the conductor, leading to the generation of an electric current. This phenomenon, now known as electromagnetic induction, has significant implications for the development of electric power generation and distribution systems.
