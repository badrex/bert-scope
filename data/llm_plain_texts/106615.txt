tldr: The author, Tiberius Cavallo, conducted experiments to study the magnetic properties of various metals, particularly brass and nickel. He discovered that hammered brass, even if initially non-magnetic, becomes magnetic after hammering. He also found that nickel can acquire magnetism independent of iron. The author's experiments and observations contribute to the understanding of magnetism in metals and their properties.
