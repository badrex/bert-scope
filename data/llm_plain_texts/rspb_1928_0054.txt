tldr: This study investigates the respiration process in apples and formulates a catalytic system to understand the relationship between oxygen and nitrogen respiration. The research focuses on the complex chain of reactions and the role of oxygen in controlling the respiration process. The authors propose a new approach to analyze the respiration system, which combines carbohydrate metabolism and respiration into one production-consumption system.
