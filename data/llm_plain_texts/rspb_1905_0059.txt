tldr: The authors successfully isolated the infecting organism, known as "zoochlorella," responsible for the green cells in Convoluta roscoffensis. They discovered that the zoochlorella is a type of algae belonging to the Chlorophyceae family. The researchers found that the infection occurs when the algae infect the Convoluta from the outside, and they were able to cultivate the algae outside the animal's body.
