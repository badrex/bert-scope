tldr: The authors studied two types of marine choanoflagellates, Acanthoecopsis spiculifera and Acanthoeca spectabilis, which have stalked and silicified loricae. They observed differences in the arrangement of costae in their lorica chambers and found that Acanthoecopsis spiculifera usually has a longer stalk and can be colonial. The authors also described the process of lorica assembly and provided detailed observations on the ultrastructure and development of these organisms.
