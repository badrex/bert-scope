tldr: The authors conducted experiments on iron and steel specimens to study their elastic limits under cyclical stress. They found that iron and steel can adjust their elastic limits to a given cycle of stress after a sufficient number of repetitions. When the adjustment is complete, the specimen becomes perfectly elastic, and fatigue does not occur. The authors also discovered that the greater the extension of the specimen during adjustment, the higher the elastic limits are raised.
