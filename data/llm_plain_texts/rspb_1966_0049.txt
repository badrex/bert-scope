tldr: The authors studied the lymphatic system in the ovaries of ewes and found that the lymphatics are more developed in ovaries with corpora lutea. They collected ovarian lymph from conscious ewes and observed a high rate of lymph flow and protein leakage. The structure of the ovarian blood vessels, including the discontinuous endothelium and open intercellular junctions, explains the high rate of lymph flow and may be related to the synthesis and secretion of steroid hormones during the oestrous cycle and pregnancy.
