tldr: This article discusses the Big Bang theory and the missing mass problem in the universe. It explores galaxy clustering and the role of dark matter in the formation and distribution of galaxies. The authors analyze data from simulations and real observations, finding that the clustering is stronger on small scales in simulations than in real data, suggesting that the missing mass may be due to difficult-to-identify large-scale structures.
