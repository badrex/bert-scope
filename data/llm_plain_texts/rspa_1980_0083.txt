tldr: This article studies the effect of detuning from the center of a Doppler-broadened transition using the rate of change of a modified density matrix. The authors explore the population density of two energy levels involved in the transition under transient conditions and consider two values of the ratio of damping parameters. The findings have implications for laser photochemistry and transitions of importance in the visible and infra-red spectral regions for both atoms and molecules.
