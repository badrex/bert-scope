tldr: The study examines the effect of molecular size on the anti-viral activity of single-stranded polyribonucleotides, specifically focusing on poly(I) and poly(C) in protecting mice against encephalomyocarditis virus infection. The results show that the degree of protection is related to the size of both poly(I) and poly(C) or poly(ho5C) copolymer. The findings have implications for understanding interferon induction and the development of antiviral therapies.
