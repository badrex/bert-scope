tldr: The authors introduce a new type of amplitude called the Feynman amplitude and present an infinite set of coupled integral equations, which are a covariant analogue to the Fock equations. These equations show that Feynman amplitudes propagate in the Feynman manner and can be used to describe the interaction of pseudo-scalar mesons with nucleons. The equations also have implications for the renormalization of the theory and the interpretation of infinities in the kernels of the equations.
