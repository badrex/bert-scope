tldr: The authors developed a new ammeter that can measure high frequency alternating currents accurately and without the need for shunts. The ammeter works by measuring the repulsive force between two parallel, current-carrying cylinders, which is proportional to the mean square current. This design allows for the frequency error to be calculated, making it suitable for use in radio communication systems with extended frequency ranges.
