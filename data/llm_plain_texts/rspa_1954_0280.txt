tldr: This article presents a study on the coherent scattering of X-rays by K electrons in heavy atoms. The authors apply a formalism developed in a previous paper to calculate the scattering cross-sections at any angle, for any initial and final polarizations, and for any spin orientation of the electrons. The results show that the zero-order Born approximation is reasonably accurate for low-energy X-rays, but may become less accurate at higher energies.
