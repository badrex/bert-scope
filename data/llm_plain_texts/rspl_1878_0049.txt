tldr: The author, Charles Tomlinson, conducted experiments to study the effect of ozone on nuclei and the activation of inactive oils. He found that ozone could make inactive oils active when mixed with them. The author also discovered that the activity of charcoal does not depend on absorption but on the condition of the air contained within its pores.
