tldr: Dr. John Kerr conducted experiments to understand the effects of electric strain on light. He discovered that the proper optical effect of electric strain is a positive or negative retardation of the light component whose plane of polarization is perpendicular to the line of force. This result is a general law of double refraction in electro-optics, affecting the velocity of transmission of light in dielectrics.
