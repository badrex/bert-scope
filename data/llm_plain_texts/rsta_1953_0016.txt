tldr: The authors investigate the conductivity of the ionosphere and its role in the dynamo theory, which explains the daily oscillations of the compass needle. They find that the effective conductivity of the ionosphere is enhanced due to the Hall effect, which accounts for the equatorial anomaly and supports Stewart's dynamo theory.
