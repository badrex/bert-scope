tldr: The article discusses a new method for calculating path integrals in polar coordinates using a Hamiltonian approach and the ordinary rules of calculus. The author checks the method by evaluating the propagator for a free particle in two dimensions and finds it to be consistent with previous results. This method avoids the complicated limiting process encountered in previous treatments of path integrals in polar coordinates.
