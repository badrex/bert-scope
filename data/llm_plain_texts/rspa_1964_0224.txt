tldr: The authors present a new approach to calculating the electronic structure of benzene using a function that allows for electron correlation caused by inter-electron repulsion. This method, which is an extension of the valence-bond treatment, uses two-centre orbitals and outperforms previous methods, such as the alternant molecular orbital method, in accurately representing the electronic structure of benzene.
