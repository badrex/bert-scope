tldr: The authors investigated the fine structure and term analysis of the Thallium II spark spectrum. They measured the wave-lengths of the spark in air and a condensed oscillatory discharge between aluminum terminals in an evacuated quartz tube containing heated thallium vapour. They identified fine structure in many of the lines, with some line separations being much greater than previously reported in atomic spectra. The study provides accurate wave-numbers of the thallium lines and contributes to the understanding of the fine structure and term analysis of Thallium II.
