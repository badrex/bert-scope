tldr: The authors develop theories of convection from maintained and instantaneous sources of buoyancy, focusing on turbulent gravitational convection in stably stratified fluids. They propose a simpler transfer assumption that relates the inflow into the edge of a convective plume to some characteristic velocity in the plume. This method allows them to study vertical convection currents in incompressible body fluids with varying temperature gradients. The authors apply their findings to predict the heights to which plumes and clouds may rise from characteristic heat sources in the atmosphere.
