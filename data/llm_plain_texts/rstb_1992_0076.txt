tldr: This article discusses the complex processing of sound by the auditory system, focusing on the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN). The DCN is organized into isofrequency sheets, and its principal cells respond to complex stimuli like filtered noise. The study implies that the DCN plays a role in interpreting sound localization cues, supporting evidence for this role is also discussed. Inhibitory interneurons, such as vertical cells and cartwheel cells, are found in the DCN and contribute to its complex organization and response types.
