tldr: This article investigates the refraction, dispersion, and sensitiveness of various liquids, focusing on their optical properties. The authors discovered that the specific refractive energy of a liquid remains constant despite changes in temperature. They also examined the optical properties of different members of homologous series and isomeric liquids, finding that the specific refractive energy and dispersion can vary depending on the chemical structure and combination of elements in the compounds.
