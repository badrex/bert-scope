tldr: The authors present a reformulation of the Hartree-Fock self-consistent field method, focusing on the density matrix as a way to calculate the total energy and one-electron density matrix directly through an iterative process. They apply this method to the molecular orbital theory of conjugated systems, providing a more accurate and self-consistent approach to the Huckel theory. This method allows for a better understanding of chemical properties and can be used to quickly write down approximate solutions for systems containing hetero-atoms.
