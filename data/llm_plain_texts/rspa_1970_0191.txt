tldr: This article explores the dynamics of extended bodies in general relativity, focusing on the moments of the charge-current vector. The author proposes a definition for a set of multipole moments of a tensor field in a curved spacetime, aiming to apply this to the energy-momentum tensor and charge-current vector of an extended body. Two sets of moments are obtained for a vector field, and the author discusses their properties and applications.
