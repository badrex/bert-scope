tldr: Dr. William Henry conducted experiments to analyze ammonia through combustion with oxygen and other gases. He found that when a specific amount of oxygen is mixed with ammonia, the ammonia is decomposed, and the hydrogen and nitrogen are obtained in a gaseous state. This method allowed him to determine the proportion of hydrogen to nitrogen in ammonia. He also experimented with other gases, such as carburetted hydrogen and olefiant gas, observing their behavior under electrization.
