tldr: The author conducted experiments on six asses to determine if the spleen plays a role in the passage of fluids from the stomach to the circulation in the natural state. The results showed that the spleen is sometimes distended and colored when the stomach contains fluids, such as tincture of rhubarb. This indicates that the spleen absorbs fluids directly from the stomach, bypassing the ordinary circulation. However, when the stomach is empty, no evidence of the rhubarb coloring is found in the spleen.
