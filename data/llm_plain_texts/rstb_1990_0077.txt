tldr: 'This study examines the impact of Iron Age de-settlement in northern Sweden on lake acidification. By analyzing pollen and diatom samples from two lakes, researchers found that while there was a clear settlement horizon indicating catchment disturbance, there was no change in diatom-reconstructed pH after de-settlement. This suggests that land-use change alone is not sufficient to cause lake acidification, and that atmospheric pollution from fossil-fuel combustion plays a significant role in the process.'
