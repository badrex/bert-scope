tldr: The authors describe the resolution and optical properties of a dissymmetric arsonic acid, which possesses molecular dissymmetry. They successfully resolve the compound into its optically active enantiomers and study their properties, including their small rotatory powers and optical stability. The findings contribute to the understanding of stereochemistry and the resolution of enantiomers in dissymmetric compounds.
