tldr: This study investigates the stopping power of mica for alpha particles, providing experimental data and theoretical constants for mica and air. The authors use a magnet, a mercury manometer, and a method of calculating the center of gravity of a group of particles to determine the stopping power and range of mica for alpha particles.
