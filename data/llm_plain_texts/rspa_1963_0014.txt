tldr: This article discusses the electronic spectra of mixed crystals, focusing on the excited electronic states of dilute mixed crystals and the interactions between host and guest molecules. The authors analyze the absorption and fluorescence spectra of mixed crystals, considering the effects of intermolecular forces and the influence of host-guest interactions on the electronic properties of the crystals. The study provides a theoretical framework for understanding the behavior of mixed crystals and their applications in various fields.
