tldr: This article presents the findings of experiments conducted to determine the thermal expansion of sea-water and its relationship with heat. The authors, T. E. Thorpe and A. W. Rucker, made these observations to contribute to the understanding of the physical history of the ocean. Their work showed the importance of accurate knowledge of sea-water's behavior with respect to heat.
