tldr: This article discusses the biochemical functions of terpenoids in plants, specifically focusing on the role of sterols. Sterols are involved in various aspects of plant development and physiology, acting as hormone precursors and integral components of cell membranes. The article reviews the chemistry and biochemistry of sterols, their biosynthesis, and their interrelation with physiological functions. It also explores the potential role of sterols as hormones and their involvement in the formation of other steroids, such as sapogenins, cardenolides, and ecdysteroids.
