tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the nuclear spins and magnetic moments of antimony isotopes. They discovered that the nuclear spins of both isotopes 121 and 123 are 5/2, but their nuclear magnetic moments are different. This research helped clarify the atomic structure and properties of antimony.
