tldr: The authors studied two species of Coal Measure anthracosaurs, Palaeogyrinus decorus and Eogyrinus attheyi, using fossils found in Derbyshire, England. They describe the cranial anatomy of these two species, providing new restorations of the occiput, braincase, skull roof, and palate. The research helps to understand the evolution and taxonomy of these ancient amphibians.
