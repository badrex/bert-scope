tldr: The author provides a formal definition of post-Newtonian approximations in general relativity and compares it with existing approaches to the Newtonian limit and post-Newtonian approximations. The study focuses on the choice of gauge conditions and the solvability of the first post-Newtonian equations for the gravitational field in appropriate function spaces.
