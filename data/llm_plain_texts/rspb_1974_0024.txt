tldr: The study investigates the effects of haemodynamic stress on blood vessel walls using arteriovenous shunts in sheep. The results show that vibrations from the shunt induce phlebosclerosis, intimal tears, mural dissection, and thrombosis in the veins. The findings suggest that haemodynamic stress plays a significant role in the development of atherosclerosis, dissecting aneurysm, and arterial ulceration, and that an atherogenic diet is not necessary for the development of atherosclerosis.
