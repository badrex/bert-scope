tldr: The authors investigated the permeability of blue-green algal gas-vacuole membranes to gases. They found that the gas-vacuole membranes are freely permeable to gases like nitrogen, oxygen, and argon. The gas-vacuoles are highly organized structures with a constant width and cone-shaped ends. These findings challenge previous beliefs about the gas-tight nature of gas-vacuoles and suggest that they may be self-erecting structures.
