tldr: The authors investigated the metabolism of phenoxy acids, amides, and nitriles in plant tissues, specifically wheat coleoptile and pea-stem tissues. They found that the breakdown of these compounds occurs through oxidation processes, including α-oxidation, which leads to the production of lower carboxylic acids. The results provide evidence that α-oxidation can occur in plant tissues and may be a general reaction in both plant and animal biochemistry.
