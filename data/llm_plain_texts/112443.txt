tldr: The author investigates the peaks and hollows exhibited in the Kew Magnetic Curves for the first two years of their production. They find that the peak-and-hollow force has a regular diurnal variation and that the type of these changes is mainly influenced by a cosmical disturbance. The study also reveals that there is a marked diurnal range in the ratio of the declination peaks and hollows to the vertical force, with the highest ratio occurring around 7 A.M.
