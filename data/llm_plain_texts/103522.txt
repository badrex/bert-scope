tldr: In 1729, a team of officers led by Peter Collison discovered an ancient well near Queenborough, Kent. They explored the well, bored through 81 feet of ground before reaching water, and found it to be an excellent source of soft, sweet, and fine water. The well's water was compared to the best spring water from nearby Milton, and it was believed to have the potential to sufficiently supply King's ships.
