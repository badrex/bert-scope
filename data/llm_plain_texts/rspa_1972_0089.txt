tldr: The authors studied the formation of excited states of aromatic hydrocarbons in benzene and cyclohexane using pulse radiolysis. They determined the yields of excited singlet and triplet state solute molecules and found that intersystem crossing from the excited singlet state plays a significant role in the formation of triplet excited states. This process accounts for up to 50% of the triplet states in cyclohexane and the entire yield in benzene solutions.
