tldr: The author invented a new stereoscope that uses revolving disks and optical lanterns to project two overlapping images onto a screen. This device allows users to view enlarged, high-quality, and stereoscopic images without the need for lenses or strain on the eyes. The stereoscope offers a more immersive and realistic viewing experience, making it an improvement over traditional methods.
