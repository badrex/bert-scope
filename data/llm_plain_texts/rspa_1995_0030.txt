tldr: This study investigates the effects of area change and friction on detonation stability in supersonic ducts using a transient quasi-one-dimensional model. The analysis shows that area change and friction force can cause a detonation wave to become unstable, and a criterion for a stabilized wave configuration is derived based on the competition between these source terms. The results provide insights into the stability of detonation waves in supersonic engines and ram accelerators.
