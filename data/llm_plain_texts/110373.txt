tldr: The author, John Davy, investigates the combinations of carbonic acid and ammonia, building on the notes of his brother, Sir H. Davy. He examines the solubility of the sesquicarbonate of ammonia at different temperatures and the composition of bicarbonate of ammonia. Additionally, he studies the effects of heat on the solid sesquicarbonate and carbonate of ammonia.
