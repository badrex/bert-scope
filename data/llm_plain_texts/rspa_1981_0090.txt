tldr: The authors studied the nuclear magnetic resonance of the cubic elpasolite compound, focusing on the enhanced nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum of Ho and the paramagnetic shifts of 23Na and 135Cs. They found that the compound exhibits cubic symmetry and analyzed the temperature-dependent anisotropy, comparing their results with the theory of crystal field parameters.
