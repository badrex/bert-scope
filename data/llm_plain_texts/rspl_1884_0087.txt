tldr: The author, H. Kolbe, investigates the chemical constitution of isatin and its transformation into isatoic acid through oxidation. He proposes that isatin is a compound of formyl and nitrogen-benzoyl, and that it can be converted into a carboxylic acid, isatoic acid, through oxidation with chromic acid. The chemical behavior of isatoic acid supports its proposed composition as a nitrogen-benzoyl carboxylic acid, and its close relation to anthranilic acid is also discussed.
