tldr: The author investigates the effect of hydrogen on the discharge of negative electricity from hot platinum. They find that hydrogen alters the character of the effects observed, leading to a change in the negative leak. The author proposes a formula to represent the variation of the leak with temperature and pressure, and discusses the implications of their findings for understanding the behavior of hot platinum in different environments.
