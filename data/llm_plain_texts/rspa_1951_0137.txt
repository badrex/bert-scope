tldr: The authors conducted an X-ray study on ribonuclease crystals to determine the molecule's structure and found that it contains five polypeptide chains lying parallel to each other on a hexagonal network. The molecule has dimensions of approximately 18 x 30 x 48 Ã… and contains between 90 and 110 amino-acid residues. This research provides insights into the structure of proteins and the ribonuclease enzyme.
