tldr: 'This study investigates chromatin transcription using mercury-substituted nucleotides to isolate transcripts from chromatin templates. The research demonstrates that E. coli RNA polymerase can transcribe the globin gene in vitro in a tissue-specific manner. Additionally, the study explores chromatin reconstitution methods and their impact on tissue-specific transcription, suggesting that dissociable chromatin components direct transcription and that reconstitution methods can significantly affect results.'
