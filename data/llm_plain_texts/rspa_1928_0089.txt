tldr: The authors studied the influence of vortices on the resistance and lift experienced by solids moving through a liquid. They found that the effect of vortices is not limited to their formation but persists as long as they exist, contributing to the resultant pressure force on the solid. The authors analyzed two cases of two-dimensional flow past circular cylinders with vortices and calculated the drag and lift forces. The results showed a resemblance to experimental lift-drag curves for Flettner rotors.
