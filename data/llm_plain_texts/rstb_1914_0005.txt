tldr: The authors conducted experiments using water cultures to study the soil solution and its impact on plant growth. They found that all cultivable soils contain a nutrient solution of approximately constant composition, which is usually sufficient for plant growth. The addition of soluble fertilizers does not permanently affect the concentration of the soil solution, as it quickly reacts with the minerals present in the soil. The observed differences in soil fertility are mainly due to the varying capacity of soils to maintain a supply of water to the plants. The response of the crop to specific fertilizers may be attributed to their precipitating or inhibiting action on plant toxins.
