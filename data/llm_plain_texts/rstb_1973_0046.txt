tldr: The study analyzed haemolysates from Yemenite and Kurdish Jews living in Israel and found a high incidence of the -thalassaemia trait in the Kurdish Jewish population. The results suggest that the approximate gene frequencies for -thalassaemia may be around 0.06 and 0.1 in the Yemenite and Kurdish Jewish communities, respectively. The findings provide insights into the genetic makeup of these populations and the prevalence of the -thalassaemia gene.
