revised_title: Extreme Infra-Red Dispersion of Polar and Non-Polar Liquids: Absorption and Reflection

  - Non-Polar Liquids
  - Atomic Polarization
  - Relaxation Time
tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the absorption and reflection of polar and non-polar liquids in the extreme infra-red region. They found that polar liquids generally have higher absorption than non-polar liquids, which can be explained by the orientation of permanent dipoles in polar liquids. The authors also calculated the atomic polarization and relaxation time for various liquids, providing insights into their molecular properties.
