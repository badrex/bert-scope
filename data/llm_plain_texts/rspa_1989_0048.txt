  - Immiscible Displacements
  - Capillary Fingering
  - Viscous Fingering
tldr: The authors conducted experiments and computer simulations to study the flow of non-wetting fluids through porous media. They discovered three types of basic displacements: capillary fingering, viscous fingering, and stable displacement. These displacements are described by statistical models, invasion percolation, diffusion-limited aggregation, and anti-DLA. The study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms controlling the displacement of fluids in porous media, considering the competition between capillary and viscous forces.
