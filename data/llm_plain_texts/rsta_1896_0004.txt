tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the electrical properties of pure sulphur, focusing on its conductivity and the effects of impurities. They used various methods to purify the sulphur and studied its allotropic forms, aiming to understand the behavior of pure substances in electrochemistry. Their work contributed to the understanding of the electrical properties of non-metallic substances and the importance of excluding dust during the preparation process.
