tldr: This article discusses the role of neutrinos in shaping the cosmic large-scale structure and their potential contribution to the dark matter problem. The authors review various arguments and theories, including the inflationary universe model, and explore the possibility of neutrinos being a part of non-baryonic dark matter. They also examine alternative mechanisms, such as cosmic strings or textures, that might make a neutrino model viable for galaxy formation.
