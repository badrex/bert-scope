tldr: This study focuses on deep-sea carbonate dissolution and its influence on atmospheric CO2. A model simulating atmospheric CO2, ocean chemistry, and sediment carbonate content is used to assess response times through perturbation experiments. The results suggest that the relatively rapid buffering of atmospheric CO2 by seawater is controlled by the rate of ocean mixing and accounts for about 60% of the total buffering by the ocean-sediment system. The more gradual buffering of atmospheric CO2 and seawater by carbonate sediments is controlled by the rate of sedimentation of carbonate particles, but the rate of this buffering is slower than previously thought.
