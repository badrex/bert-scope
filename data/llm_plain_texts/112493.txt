tldr: J. H. N. Hennessey, a First Assistant on the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India, analyzed rainfall data from 13 consecutive years to debunk the popular belief that more rain falls during the changes of the moon. Using data from Mussoorie, Hennessey found that the average daily rainfall during the changes of the moon was actually lower than on intermediate days, contrary to the popular belief.
