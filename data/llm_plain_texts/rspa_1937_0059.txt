tldr: The authors conducted experiments to analyze the absorption spectrum of bromine in the near-infrared. They studied the vibrational constants and dissociation energies of the lower and main upper states, and proposed an increase in the provisional numeration of the quantum states. The study provides insights into the potential energy curves and excited states of the main and extreme red systems of bromine.
