tldr: This study investigates the flame speeds in the inflammation and detonation of moist carbonic oxide-oxygen mixtures. The authors found that the detonation range of these mixtures lies between 40% and 80% carbon monoxide content, while the inflammation range is between 16.4% and 94% carbon monoxide content. The experimental results provide insights into the behavior of these mixtures and their potential applications in combustion research.
