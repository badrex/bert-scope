tldr: The authors develop a method to calculate fractional parentage coefficients and central force energy matrices for equivalent particles in nuclear configurations. They adapt Jahn's method to obtain fully antisymmetric wave functions and use invariant theory to obtain linear combinations of Slater integrals. This work helps determine the ordering of levels in jj-coupling with short-range central interactions by using Casimir's operator.
