tldr: Researchers discovered a new model for the microstructure of spider silk, specifically the dragline thread of the golden silk spider Nephila. The model suggests that the silk consists of a structured fibril tube surrounding a thin core, which could explain its supreme tensile strength. This finding challenges the general view of spider silk structure and provides insights into the unique properties of this biopolymer.
