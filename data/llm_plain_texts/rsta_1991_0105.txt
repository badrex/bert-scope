tldr: This article discusses the determination of stress deviators from fault kinematics and focal mechanisms of earthquakes in the Himalayas-Tibet and Central Andes regions. The authors examine the spatial and temporal changes in tectonic regimes and stress fields, providing insights into the uplift of the Tibetan plateau and the changes in boundary forces due to subduction processes in the Andean Plateau.
