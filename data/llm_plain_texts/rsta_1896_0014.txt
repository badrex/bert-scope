tldr: 'The authors developed a sensitive induction balance method to measure the magnetization of liquids. They investigated the magnetization induced on the surface of a cylindrical body and the effect of induced currents in a coil around the center. This method allowed for accurate determination of the coefficient of magnetization in absolute measure, even with small forces.'
