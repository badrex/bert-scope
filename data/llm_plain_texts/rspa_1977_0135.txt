tldr: The authors study the vibrational energy distribution in the quenching of singlet molecular oxygen and apply the statistical theory to interpret their findings. They discover that the energy released in the quenching process has a stronger propensity to appear as vibration in the quencher than expected on a purely statistical basis. The results show that the quenching process has a common linear surprise plot for both singlet molecular oxygen and oxygen, indicating that the energy transfer is similar in both cases.
