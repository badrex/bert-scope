tldr: The authors develop an asymptotic series for the stream function of laminar flow in channels with slightly curved walls. They expand the governing equation for the stream function into a series of ordinary differential equations and calculate higher-order terms. The study focuses on a class of symmetrical channels with slowly varying divergence angles, providing a mathematical analysis and comparison with experimental results.
