tldr: The study investigates the left hemisphere's role in controlling oral and brachial movements and its relation to communication. It confirms that patients with left-hemisphere damage have difficulties in performing oral and manual movements on command, such as smiling, protruding the tongue, or showing how to salute. The left frontal area is crucial for controlling oral movements, while the parietal lobe controls hand movements. The findings suggest that oral and manual control systems are more separable in the frontal than in the parietal region, indicating that the parietal lobe may play a general programming role enacted through the left frontal region.
