tldr: The authors studied the antibacterial activity of 6-aminopenicillanic acid, a core structure of all penicillins, and found that it has lower activity against Gram-positive bacteria but similar activity against Gram-negative bacteria compared to benzylpenicillin. The study also showed that 6-aminopenicillanic acid interferes with cell wall formation, similar to benzylpenicillin, and that bacteria can develop resistance to both compounds.
