tldr: The article discusses the coordinate perturbation technique and its application in gas dynamics. The authors present a simpler way of applying the technique, bypassing the transformed equations and providing the appropriate coordinate stretching through algebraic manipulations. They demonstrate the method's effectiveness in solving gas-dynamical problems, such as flow fields around supersonic wings and oscillations in closed tubes, and highlight the importance of supplementing the coordinate perturbation technique with the multiple scale technique for accurate results.
