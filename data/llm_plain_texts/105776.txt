tldr: This article shares two medical observations by Dr. Joseph Benevuti and Dr. Ch. Allioni. The first case is about a man who recovers surprisingly from a fever after swallowing a large quantity of snow. The second case is about a man with gigantism, whose head and facial features grew abnormally large while the rest of his body remained small. Despite his condition, the man has good strength, quick understanding, and a good memory.
