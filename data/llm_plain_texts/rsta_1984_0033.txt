tldr: This article investigates the electrostatic forces and interactions between clay minerals and water in clay-water dispersions. The authors use macroscopic clay surfaces, such as cleaved mica, to study these forces and compare the results with concentrated aqueous dispersions of various montmorillonites. The study focuses on the consequences of isomorphous substitution in the tetrahedral and octahedral layers of clay minerals, which leads to an electric charge at the clay-water interface and influences the properties of clay-water dispersions.
