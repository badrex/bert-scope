tldr: The article discusses a new approach to the problem of concept learning in artificial devices, focusing on a computational model of knowledge acquisition without explicit programming. The study of learnability is based on a probabilistic model that allows for arbitrary and unknown distributions of variable values in nature. The author proposes a definition of learnability for classes of programs and a deduction procedure that runs in polynomial time, enabling the deduction of programs that approximate the target concept with high probability.
