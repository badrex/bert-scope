tldr: This article discusses the melting of the Earth's mantle and its role in the evolution of the atmosphere and crust. The authors estimate the abundance of heat-producing elements in the Earth and analyze isotope and trace element data to identify the source regions of mantle-derived melts. They also assess the role of silicate liquid transfer in the production of depleted mantle and the timing of transfer events throughout Earth's history.
