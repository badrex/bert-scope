revised_title: 'Large-amplitude Elongated-body Theory and its Application to Fish Locomotion'
semantic_tags:
  - Fish locomotion
  - Carangiform motion
  - Elongated-body theory
  - Aquatic animal propulsion
  - Reactive forces
tldr: The author extends the elongated-body theory of fish locomotion to include large-amplitude motions, focusing on carangiform propulsion. This theory considers reactive forces between the fish and water, taking into account the inertia of associated water movements. The author applies this theory to fish with slender caudal fins, providing a better understanding of their propulsion and efficiency in swimming.
