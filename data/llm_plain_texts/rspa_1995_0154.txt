tldr: The authors propose a new approach to failure assessment diagrams that incorporates constraint effects and the enhanced toughness of materials. They modify existing diagrams to account for the influence of constraint on crack tip fields and suggest ways to take advantage of this enhanced toughness in defect assessment schemes. This work provides a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of material behavior under stress, ensuring the fitness for purpose and structural integrity of engineering components with defects.
