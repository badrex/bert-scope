tldr: This study investigates the confluence of signals from the two eyes in stereoscopy and the Panum phenomenon, where a monocular visual stimulus located near a binocular one acquires a depth signal. The findings led to the development of a scheme of uniocular connectivity to a matrix of depth units, demonstrating how the brain processes and integrates binocular signals for depth perception.
