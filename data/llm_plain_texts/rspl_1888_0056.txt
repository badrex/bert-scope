tldr: The author presents a new form of eudiometer that is accurate, simple, and easy to use for oxygen estimation and atmospheric analysis. The eudiometer allows for easy introduction of air, mixing with hydrogen gas, and accurate readings. It can also be used in conjunction with Pettenkofer's method for carbonic acid determination in atmospheric air.
