tldr: This paper presents an in-depth osteological analysis of the Solitaire bird, Pezophaps solitaria, from Rodriguez Island. The authors compare the bones of the Solitaire to those of the Dodo and Didunculus, highlighting the differences and similarities in their skeletal structures. They also discuss the extinction of the Solitaire, attributing it to the introduction of feral swine on the island, which outcompeted and drove the Solitaire to extinction.
