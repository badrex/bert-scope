tldr: The authors analyzed the distribution of avian tribes in the New World, finding that the mean age of tribes is greatest at the equator and declines towards the Poles. This pattern is more pronounced in the northern hemisphere. The study suggests that the tropics act as a "museum" of biological diversity, with low extinction rates, rather than a cradle of new species.
