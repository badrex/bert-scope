tldr: The authors conducted an experiment to analyze the spectrum of the spontaneous luminous radiation emitted by radium at ordinary temperatures. They discovered a spectrum with eight bright lines and at least eight faint lines, which they compared to the spectrum of nitrogen. The results suggest that the radiation may be coming from helium contained within the radium bromide.
