tldr: The Taupo eruption in New Zealand was one of the largest and most powerful volcanic events in the world within the past 7000 years. This eruption produced a variety of pyroclastic deposits, including two plinian pumice falls, three phreatomagmatic ashes, and several ignimbrite flow units. The vent was located within a lake, and magma-water interaction played a significant role in the eruption's style. The Taupo eruption's complexity and size make it difficult to accurately forecast future eruptions from the Taupo Volcanic Centre.
