tldr: The authors use an expansion method to calculate atomic properties for various elements in the lithium sequence. They compare the results with more refined calculations and find that despite its simplicity, the method is accurate. The study examines the influence of direct and exchange interactions on effective screening constants and provides insights into atomic structure and spectroscopy.
