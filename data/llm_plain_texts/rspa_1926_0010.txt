tldr: 'The authors studied the electrification and surface tension of bubbles in water, using various gases such as nitrogen, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide. They found that the gas phase at the interface influences the electrification and surface tension, and that a new water surface in contact with hydrogen has a lower surface tension than one in contact with oxygen. The results indicate that the gas phase plays a significant role in surface phenomena until the liquid phase reaches its equilibrium state.'
