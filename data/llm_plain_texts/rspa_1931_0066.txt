tldr: The authors studied nondiagram X-ray lines and found that they result from transitions between two states with the same initial and final total quantum numbers but different screening constants. They also discovered that these lines have similarities to screening doublets in X-ray absorption spectra and that their behavior becomes more regular when associated with the parent line instead of the principal diagram line.
