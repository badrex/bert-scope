tldr: This study investigates the heat capacities and compressibilities of liquid acetone and methyl iodide mixtures. The authors found that the heat capacities increase with temperature and isothermal compression. They also determined the adiabatic compressibilities using ultrasonic interferometry and compared their results with other methods. The findings provide insights into the properties of polar solutions and the behavior of mixtures of acetone and methyl iodide.
