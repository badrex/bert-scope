tldr: Edward Pigott observed the late transit of Mercury over the Sun at Louvain in the Netherlands. He communicated his findings in a letter to Nevil Maskelyne. Pigott used Ramsden's two-feet achromatic telescope to make his observations. The observed times differed considerably from the predicted times, which would have surprised M. De La Land.
