tldr: The author conducted experiments on rabbits and frogs to understand the relationship between the heart and the nervous system. They found that the heart's action is influenced by the state of the nervous system and that both involuntary and voluntary muscles obey the same laws. The author also concluded that the nervous system consists of two parts, one purely sensorial and the other conveying impressions, and that the three vital powers (muscular, nervous, and sensorial) are connected but not strictly dependent on each other.
