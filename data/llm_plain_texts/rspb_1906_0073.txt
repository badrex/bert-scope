tldr: The author investigates the pharmacology of ethyl chloride, a general anaesthetic, and its effects on the heart and respiratory system. They find that ethyl chloride is rapidly acting and induces anaesthesia pleasantly, but it is not as safe as nitrous oxide, with a higher death rate. The study also shows that ethyl chloride has a paralytic effect on heart muscle, similar to chloroform, but requires a much larger amount of the substance to achieve comparable results.
