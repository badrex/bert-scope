tldr: The authors studied the kinetics of styrene polymerization initiated by n-butyl lithium in hydrocarbon media. They found that both initiation and propagation of growing chains occur simultaneously and without termination reactions. The results support the mechanism proposed by Worsfold and Bywater, with the degree of polymerization being greater than the ratio of monomer to initiator concentration. The study provides insights into the polymerization process and its applications in the field of materials science.
