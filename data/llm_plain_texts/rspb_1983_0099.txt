revised_title: 'Cultured Rat Submandibular Ganglion Neurons and Their Responses to Acetylcholine'
semantic_tags:
  - Neuronal culture
  - Acetylcholine receptors
  - Patch clamp technique
  - Ganglion neurons
  - Pharmacology
tldr: The article describes the culture of rat submandibular ganglion neurons and their macroscopic responses to acetylcholine. The neurons were grown in a controlled environment and their responses were recorded using the whole-cell voltage-clamp technique. The cultured neurons had similar characteristics to adult rat submandibular ganglion neurons, with resting potentials around -60mV and smaller responses to acetylcholine compared to adult neurons.
