tldr: The author analyzes the asymptotic structure of near-tip fields around stationary and steadily growing interface cracks with frictionless contact in anisotropic bimaterials. A complete representation of the asymptotic fields is obtained using the method of analytic continuation. The study considers combined in-plane and out-of-plane deformation and provides insights into the effect of material mismatch and crack propagation speed on the size of the contact zone.
