tldr: The authors investigate the turnover and proliferation of macrophages in inflamed connective tissue. They discover that macrophages in inflammatory reactions can be categorized into three types: newly arrived from circulation, a high turnover pool dependent on bone marrow recruitment, and a self-sufficient population independent of further marrow recruitment. The study provides insights into the complex process of macrophage proliferation and turnover in different types of inflammation.
