tldr: The study investigates the impact of phenobarbitone on the function of GABA receptors in cultured mammalian neurons. Phenobarbitone was found to increase the time that GABA-activated channels remain open, leading to a prolonged duration of inhibitory synaptic events. This suggests that the enhancement of these events by barbiturates is due to their postsynaptic action.
