tldr: This article investigates the mineral phase in bone and its possible linkage to the organic matrix through protein-bound phosphate bonds. The authors propose that phosphoproteins, synthesized by osteoblasts, link the mineral and organic phases of bone. They also discuss the amorphous calcium phosphate theory, which suggests that the initial mineral phase of bone gradually transforms into poorly crystalline hydroxyapatite as the bone matures.
