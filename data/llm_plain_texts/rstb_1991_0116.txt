tldr: This article examines the dietary changes and health implications associated with the transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture and animal husbandry in the Near East and Mediterranean Region. The authors describe the shift in subsistence practices and use quantitative modeling to analyze the potential patterns of dietary and nutrient intakes before and after the establishment of agrarian economies. They suggest that protein deficiency was likely only in cases of chronic energy deficiency and no meat consumption, while dietary calcium deficiency was possible with moderate to severe chronic energy deficiency. Anaemias, although present after the transition, were unlikely to have had dietary causes.
