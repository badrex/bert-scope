tldr: The author, Benjamin Wilson, observed electric properties in various gems similar to tourmalin. He found that the direction of the electric fluid in these gems depends on their internal structure and that the resistance the fluid meets is less in one direction. This discovery supports the idea that the electric fluid flows in a specific line within the gem, similar to the flow of the magnetic poles in a loadstone.
