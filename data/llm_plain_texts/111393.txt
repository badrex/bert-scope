tldr: This paper presents a fundamental theorem for the summation of integrals with limits determined by the roots of an algebraic equation. It also discusses the comparison of functional transcendents and extends the theory of definite integrals. The author introduces a symbol, 0, which is used in the expression of the theorem and is related to Cauchy's symbol. The paper includes applications of the general theorem and notes on the connection between the author's and Cauchy's symbols, as well as theorems for evaluating multiple integrals.
