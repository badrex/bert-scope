tldr: This study investigates the use of magnetoacoustic emission (MAE) and Barkhausen emission (BE) to measure stress in steels with varying microstructures. The authors found that both techniques are sensitive to stress and microstructure, with MAE being more sensitive to stress in ferritic-pearlitic steel and BE being sensitive to both stress and microstructure. The results suggest that MAE can be used to measure stress when the general microstructure is known, while BE can be used as an additional technique to resolve any ambiguity. This research contributes to the development of non-destructive testing methods for monitoring stress in metallic components.
