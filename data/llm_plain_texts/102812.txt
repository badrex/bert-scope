tldr: 'Anthony van Leeuwenhoek observed and described the tiny living creatures in the male seed and spawn of codfish using a microscope. He discovered that these creatures were smaller than previously thought and found similarities between the tiny organisms in different species. His observations provided a deeper understanding of the reproductive biology of fish and the microscopic world.'
