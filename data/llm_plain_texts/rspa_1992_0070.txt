tldr: The author studies index theory for orbifolds and derives the orbifold index theorem of T. Kawasaki using cyclic theory. The main result is an extension of the cohomological index formula for orbifolds of T. Kawasaki from the -theoretical index theorem by using the methods introduced by A. Connes and G. The theorem can be generalized to the case of orbifold -bundles over closed spin orbifolds, and numerical index formulae for orbifolds are recalled. The author also proves Kawasaki's index theorem for orbifolds and provides a local expression of the cyclic cocycle corresponding to the index.
