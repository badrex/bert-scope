tldr: The article discusses the concept of living polymers, which are polymers that can continue to grow after the addition of monomers. The author explores the various synthetic opportunities and applications of living polymers, such as the preparation of polymers of uniform molecular weight, block polymers, star-shaped and comb-shaped polymers, and polymers with functional end-groups. The article also highlights the importance of electron transfer reactions in the formation of living polymers.
