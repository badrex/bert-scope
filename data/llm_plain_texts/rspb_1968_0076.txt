tldr: The author discusses the unification of neural activity in the brain and how it leads to decision making. They propose a theory that explains how the brain's hierarchical structure and reciprocal innervation of opposing muscles contribute to the decision-making process. The author also suggests that this mechanism may be present in other parts of the nervous system, providing a basis for understanding higher-level brain functions and consciousness.
