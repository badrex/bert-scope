tldr: The authors investigated the change in the absorption spectrum of cobalt chloride in aqueous solutions with increasing concentration of hydrochloric acid. They found that the transition from red to blue occurs at a specific concentration of acid and determined the dependence of this change on the environment. The study confirms previous observations and provides new insights into the chemical reactions occurring in the solutions.
