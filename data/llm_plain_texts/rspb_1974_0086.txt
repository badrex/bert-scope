tldr: The authors investigated the synaptic organization of optic afferents in the amphibian tectum by recording potentials evoked by stimulating the optic nerve. They identified four distinct postsynaptic components and found that the postsynaptic sites of optic nerve fibers are located in four layers of the superficial part of the optic tectum. The study also describes some electrophysiological properties of each of the four classes of synapses.
