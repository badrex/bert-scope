tldr: This article presents a method for transforming wave functions of the nuclear p-shell into linear combinations of antisymmetric states for particles vector-coupled to antisymmetric states of particles. The authors provide a new notation for symbols describing the irreducible representations of special unitary groups and tabulate the coefficients required for the calculations. This form of wave functions is suitable for evaluating two-body interactions and has been used in investigations on the effect of non-central forces on the levels of p-shell nuclei.
