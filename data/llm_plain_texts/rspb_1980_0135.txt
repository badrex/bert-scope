tldr: The authors develop a migration-selection model that explains the morph ratio clines in moth species, specifically focusing on melanism in Biston betularia and Phigalia pilosaria. They find that strong non-visual selection and weak frequency-dependent predation are necessary to explain these clines. The model helps to understand the distribution of melanic forms in moths and the factors influencing their frequencies.
