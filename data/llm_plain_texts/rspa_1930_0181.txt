tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the cathodic combustion of carbonic oxide and found that the presence of diluents, such as nitrogen, helium, and argon, can affect the rate of combustion. They also discovered that carbonic oxide can be burnt cathodically without being ionized. The results showed that the rate of combustion increases with the total pressure and the excess of oxygen. The authors also studied the effect of steam and metal particles on the combustion process and found that they can accelerate the rate of combustion. The findings provide insights into the mechanism of combustion and the role of diluents in the process.
