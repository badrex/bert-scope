tldr: This study investigates the movement of photosynthetically fixed carbon in the molluscs Elysia viridis and Tridachia crispata. Chloroplasts from Codium fragile enter the animal cells without damage and release carbon to the animal tissues. The researchers use an "inhibition technique" to study the movement of carbon between the cells. They find that fixed carbon is released to the medium when the molluscs are incubated in a solution containing unlabelled glucose or galactose. This technique can be useful in studying intercellular transport of molecules in various organisms.
