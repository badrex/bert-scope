tldr: The authors conducted calorimetric experiments on silver iodide and its alloys with copper and lead iodides. They found that the specific heat and thermal expansion of these substances change significantly during phase transitions, which involve structural changes and color changes. The authors also suggested that some of the alloys might be considered chemical or molecular compounds.
