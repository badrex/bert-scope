tldr: The study investigates the effects of thyroxine injections on milk secretion and blood-milk phosphatase levels in lactating cows. The results show that thyroxine injections increase serum phosphatase levels and affect milk production, with the response being more significant in cows with initially lower serum phosphatase levels. The research also explores the relationship between thyroid hormones and milk secretion, providing insights into the mechanisms of lactation.
