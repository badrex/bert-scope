tldr: The authors observed and analyzed five different types of cirral activity in sessile barnacles, which vary in muscular and cirral movement. They linked the presence of a through current in the mantle cavity to respiratory exchange and feeding mechanisms. The study also traced the interrelationship of cirral movements, feeding, and respiratory exchange through the possible course of evolution of barnacles.
