tldr: The authors studied the time and duration of female meiosis in two Lilium hybrids, 'Sonata' and 'Black Beauty,' under controlled conditions. They found that female meiosis in ovules does not start until about the time when male meiosis in pollen mother cells is completed. The study also confirmed the close correlation between bud length and the development of the embryo sac mother cell, allowing the estimation of the duration of female meiosis. The results provide insights into the prolonged process of meiosis in Lilium and its potential implications for plant breeding and genetics.
