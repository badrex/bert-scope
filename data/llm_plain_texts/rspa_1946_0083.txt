tldr: The authors investigate the algebra generated by the four matrices in the relativistic wave equation of a particle with maximum spin 3/2. They introduce auxiliary quantities and define further auxiliary symbols to study the algebra in detail. The authors find three irreducible representations of orders 1, 4, and 5 for the algebra, which could be important in understanding the behavior of particles like the proton.
