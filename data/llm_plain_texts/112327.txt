tldr: A. W. Hofmann discovered that commercial aniline contains a different base from normal aniline, which is essential for the production of aniline-red. He examined various sources of aniline and found that the base in commercial aniline is not an isomer of aniline but a different base. This discovery is important for both theory and practice, as it sheds light on the enigmatic formation of rosaniline.
