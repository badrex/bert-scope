tldr: A doctor shares a case study of a patient who had a stone removed from their bladder that contained hair. The stone was about the size of a goose egg and was hard and heavy, with hairs growing out of it. The patient had passed many hairs in their urine, and it was believed that some of them grew from the stone. The doctor also mentions a previous case of a fake bladder stone involving a cunning boy.
