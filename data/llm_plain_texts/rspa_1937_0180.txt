tldr: The authors discovered that chlorophyll can be reversibly oxidized by certain oxidizing agents, such as ferric chloride, transforming it into a yellow product. This process is influenced by light and can be reversed by ferrous chloride. The study provides insights into the behavior of chlorophyll and its potential applications in understanding photosynthesis and plant pigments.
