tldr: 'This study investigates the relationship between the durations of the isometric twitch and the after-action of tetanus in muscle contractions. The research finds that the duration of the twitch is always slightly greater than the duration of the after-action of a tetanus. The study also shows that fatigue can be identified by the increase in the duration of the after-action above that of the twitch, and the disappearance of the "angle" at the end of the plateau in the muscle contraction curve.'
