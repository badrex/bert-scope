tldr: The Princeton Experiment Package on the Copernicus satellite is a telescope-spectrometer designed to measure interstellar absorption lines with high wavelength resolution. The equipment scans stellar spectra between 950 and 1450 Å in second order and between 1650 and 3000 Å in first order. The photometric precision is limited by photon counts and can observe stars down to a nominal limit of 5th magnitude. The package provides valuable data for understanding the universe's composition and structure.
