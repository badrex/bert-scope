tldr: The authors discovered that potato phosphorylase, an enzyme, can catalyze the reversible conversion of starch and inorganic phosphate into glucose-1-phosphate. They found that the reaction proceeds in either direction, depending on the ratio of inorganic orthophosphate to glucose-1-phosphate. The authors also observed that the enzyme's activity is affected by pH levels and that adding starch or maltose can increase the reaction velocity. This research sheds light on carbohydrate metabolism in plants.
