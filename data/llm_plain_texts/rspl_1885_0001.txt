tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the atomic weight of glucinum (beryllium) and its compounds. They analyzed the specific heat of metallic beryllium and the vapour-density of volatile beryllium compounds. The results confirmed the importance of understanding the atomic weight and properties of beryllium for its proper placement in the periodic table and its applications in chemistry.
