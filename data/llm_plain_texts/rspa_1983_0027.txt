tldr: This article presents a computationally efficient least-squares method for minimizing the vibration of general rotor-bearing systems by applying external control forces. The method uses the optimality concept to optimize force locations and provides a wide range of statistical information. Magnetic bearings can be used to implement the open-loop adaptive vibration control strategies outlined in the paper.
