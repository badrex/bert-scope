tldr: This paper reviews the techniques available for predicting the manoeuvring characteristics of ships, focusing on design aspects. It discusses the limitations of current methods, such as free model testing and constrained model testing, and suggests that a more direct approach to determining ship responses may be a promising avenue for further research.
