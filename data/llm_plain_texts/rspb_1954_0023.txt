tldr: The author investigates the adaptation of E. coli mutabile to lactose and finds that a large proportion of the bacterial population is potentially adaptable. The study challenges the mutation theory, which claims that a rare type of mutant is responsible for lactose adaptation, and supports the idea that an adaptive process occurs during the lag phase in a liquid medium.
