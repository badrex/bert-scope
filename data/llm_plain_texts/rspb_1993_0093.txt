tldr: The authors introduce a new mechanism for evolutionary discontinuities in ecosystems and discuss its relation to punctuated equilibria, stasis, and gradualism. They propose that these phenomena are natural consequences of a nonlinear dynamic approach to evolutionary stability. The study also provides insights into speciation and the role of phenotype constraints in determining the validity of the Red Queen hypothesis.
