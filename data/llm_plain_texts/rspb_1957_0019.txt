tldr: The authors investigated the oxidation-reduction potentials, pH, and oxygen tension in tumors using a potentiometric method. They found that breathing oxygen caused a rise in oxidation-reduction potential and oxygen tension in most tissues, while intravenous injection of 2-methyl-1:4-naphthohydroquinone diphosphate (Synkavit) caused a fall in oxidation-reduction potentials. The experiments suggest the presence of a'redox' buffering system in tissues and provide insights into cancer treatment.
