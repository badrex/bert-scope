tldr: 'This study examines the glial cells and their relationships with neurons in the buccal ganglia of the snail Planorbis corneus. The research explores cytological, qualitative, and quantitative changes during growth and aging, including the roles of glial cells in phagocytosis and degeneration within the ganglia. The findings provide insights into the physiological functions of glial cells and their interactions with neurons in the nervous system.'
