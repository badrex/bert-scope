tldr: This article presents an extensive research on the electrochemical theory of metallic corrosion in water and dilute salt solutions. The authors aim to measure the corrosion rate and test the adequacy of the electrochemical theory in various conditions. They discuss the factors that influence corrosion, such as oxygen distribution, films of corrosion products, and the presence of colloids. The authors also explore the role of soluble and insoluble corrosion products in the corrosion process and their distribution.
