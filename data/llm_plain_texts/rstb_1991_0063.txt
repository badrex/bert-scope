tldr: The study investigates the spontaneous intracellular activity of the thoracic ventral eclosion muscle in tsetse flies during the destruction process. The muscle does not show steady depolarization, and its neuromuscular junctions appear to be protected. The findings suggest that the muscle has unique ionic requirements and is different from other insect skeletal muscles.
