tldr: Prof. Hansteen's letter discusses the variations of the magnetical inclination and the need for more observations to determine the epoch of the minimum. He requests other scientists to contribute their observations, especially from London. The letter also mentions the harmony of these variations with the general motion of the magnetical system in the northern hemisphere.
