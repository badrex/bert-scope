tldr: This study examines the neurosecretory innervation and cell types in the pituitary gland of eels at different stages of their life cycle. The research focuses on the relationship between Type A and B neurosecretory fibers from the hypothalamus and various cell types in the pars distalis. The findings provide insights into the control of pituitary function in teleost fishes and the role of neurosecretory fibers in regulating the endocrine cells of the eel pituitary.
