tldr: The authors investigated the effects of Dendroaspis neurotoxins on synaptic transmission in the spinal cord of the frog. They found that four of the six neurotoxins tested blocked the cholinergic pathway in the spinal cord, suggesting that they act by blocking acetylcholine receptors. These findings could potentially aid in the localization and isolation of acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system of vertebrates.
