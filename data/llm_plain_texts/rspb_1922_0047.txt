tldr: The authors discovered that certain animal tissues and milk can oxidize xanthin and hypoxanthin anaerobically, converting them into uric acid. This process is significant for understanding biological oxidation and the role of oxygen in the oxidation process. The study also found that milk contains a catalyst that oxidizes xanthin and hypoxanthin anaerobically, and that this catalyst is not identical to Schardinger's enzyme.
