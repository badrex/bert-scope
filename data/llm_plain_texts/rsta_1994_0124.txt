tldr: This article discusses the magnetism of meteorites and its implications for understanding the early magnetic fields in the Solar System. The authors describe the characteristics of remanent magnetization in different types of meteorites and discuss their magnetizing history. They also explore the evidence provided by meteorites, particularly those originating from Mars, for a weak, ancient Martian magnetic field.
