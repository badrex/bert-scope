tldr: This article explores the dynamics of a parametrically excited pendulum, which exhibits various stable periodic and chaotic motions. The authors use topological theory to locate and predict the existence of unstable periodic orbits, which can then be controlled and stabilized using a simple control algorithm. This approach provides flexibility in achieving different periodic states by adjusting the driving frequency.
