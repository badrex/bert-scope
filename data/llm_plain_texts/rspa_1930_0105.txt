tldr: The authors studied the ultra-violet absorption spectrum of phosgene vapour and found that the normal molecule has three energy levels separated by intervals of 592 cm. They discovered that the activated molecule has two vibration periods and that the atomic vibration frequencies are less in the activated molecule, indicating that the distance between atoms increases. The phosgene molecule is more deformable than formaldehyde but less than chlorine. The study also discusses the mechanism of the photochemical reaction and the role of the isotope effect in molecular spectra.
