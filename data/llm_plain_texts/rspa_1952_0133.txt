tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the angular distribution and cross-section of neutron-proton scattering at 156 MeV using a high-energy neutron beam and a polythene radiator. They determined the ratio of the angular distribution for neutron-proton scattering and found that the minimum value of the differential cross-section occurs at an angle between 75 and 85 degrees. The results are in general agreement with previous studies and provide valuable information for understanding nuclear interactions and particle accelerator research.
