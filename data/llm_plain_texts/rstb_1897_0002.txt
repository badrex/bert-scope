tldr: The author conducted experiments on animals to study the effects of interrupting the afferent and efferent tracts of the cerebellum. They found that dividing the inferior cerebellar peduncle caused disturbances in coordination and movement, while partial hemisection of the medulla resulted in general convulsions. These findings provide insights into the role of the cerebellum in controlling motor functions and its connections with other brain regions.
