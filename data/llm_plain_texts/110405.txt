tldr: The author, Charles J. B. Williams, presents a new law of combustion that shows most combustible bodies undergo a low-temperature combustion process, producing light and heat. This phenomenon occurs in phosphorus, sulfur, and other inflammable bodies. The author also discusses the nature of products from this low-form combustion, which may be an intermediate link between open combustion, fermentation, and putrefaction.
