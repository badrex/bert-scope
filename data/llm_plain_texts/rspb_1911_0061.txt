tldr: The author studied the developmental forms of Trypanosoma brucei in gerbils, observing changes in the parasite both inside and outside of red blood cells. They found that the parasite undergoes a cycle of development, with some forms appearing in the spleen, bone-marrow, and axillary glands. The study also noted the presence of free chromatin granules in the blood, which may represent a first stage in development.
