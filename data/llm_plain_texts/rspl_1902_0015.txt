tldr: The authors studied the properties and contraction of arterial walls, particularly in post-mortem conditions. They observed that arterial walls contract and change shape after death, which can affect measurements and understanding of blood vessels. They also investigated the factors that influence this contraction, such as exposure to air, temperature, and chemical substances like chloroform and suprarenal extract.
