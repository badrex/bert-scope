tldr: The author proposes that the W chromosome in birds is facultatively heterochromatic and carries one or more homologous sex-determination genes. The absence of dosage compensation in ZZ embryos and W inactivation in ZW embryos create a 2:1 (ZZ) - (ZW) inequality in the effective copy number of sex-determination genes. This inequality, along with W inactivation, helps regulate sex determination in birds.
