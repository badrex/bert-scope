tldr: This article discusses recent experiments on the chemistry of corrin, focusing on the crystallographic examination of the cobalt 'pseudo-corrin' complex. The author highlights the non-planar nature of the inner ring in nickel pentamethyl cyanocorrin chloride and its implications for the stereochemistry of the ring junction. The article also explores the effects of cobalt to nickel substitution and the potential for further exploration of corrin chemistry through synthesis.
