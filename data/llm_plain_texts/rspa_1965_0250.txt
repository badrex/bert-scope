tldr: The authors conducted a theoretical analysis of the hyperfine structure of the twelve levels of Eu I using intermediate-coupled eigenfunctions and tensor-operator techniques. They found good agreement with experimental values, treating the polarization of the core and the hyperfine interaction constant as parameters. The study provides valuable insights into core polarization and hyperfine structure anomalies, which can help interpret spectra involving other rare-earth ions.
