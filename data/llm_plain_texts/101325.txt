tldr: Dr. Tonge investigates the flow of sap in trees and its relation to growth, fruitfulness, and environmental factors. He observes that sap flow is influenced by factors such as temperature, rainfall, and soil quality. Dr. Tonge suggests that proper sap extraction and pruning techniques could potentially improve tree growth and fruit production. He also inquires about the role of specific seasons in root and fruit growth and whether certain soils can enhance fruitfulness.
