tldr: The author analyzes the lines visible in solar disturbances and spots, comparing them to the lines observed in solar prominences. They discover that 18 lines, called "basic lines," are always widened in solar spots and prominences. This finding suggests that the sun's reversing layer contains a mix of vapors with a predominant base, and it adds importance to the study of spot and storm phenomena.
