tldr: The author conducted a series of experiments to study the diurnal variation in the amount of carbon dioxide in the air at Grasmere. They found that there is a distinct diurnal variation, with the night average exceeding the day average by 0.34 cubic centimeters in 10,000 of air. This research helps to understand the causes of changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels throughout the day.
