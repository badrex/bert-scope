tldr: This paper reviews three alternative boundary element approaches for modeling frictional contact problems. The authors discuss the node-on-node approach, the mapped-element approach, and the fictitious-node algorithm. They compare the features, merits, and drawbacks of each method and provide practical examples to demonstrate their accuracy.
