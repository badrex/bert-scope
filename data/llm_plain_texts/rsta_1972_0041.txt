tldr: 'This article discusses the challenges and pitfalls of using archaeological and historical evidence to determine changes in relative land and sea levels in southern Britain during the Holocene period. The author highlights the imprecise nature of the data and the various factors that can affect depositional levels, land and sea junctions, and the heights of relative and absolute sea level. The article also examines the evidence for subsidence in southern Britain and the impact of human activities on the environment.'
