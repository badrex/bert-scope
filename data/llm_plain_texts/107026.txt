tldr: The author, Lawrence de Crell, conducted experiments to analyze the decomposition of the acid of borax or sedative salt. He used oxygenated muriatic acid to separate and dissolve the components of the sedative salt, observing changes in color and the formation of new substances. This research aimed to understand the composition and properties of the acid found in borax, which was scarce and only available in specific substances and situations.
