tldr: The author presents a theory explaining the mechanism of fatigue failure in metals, which involves the slipping of crystals with different orientations and initial stresses. The model demonstrates that the fatigue range is the same as the elastic range, and the theory can explain most of the phenomena observed in metals when tested for fatigue. The limitations of the theory are discussed, and the model is compared to real metal test pieces.
