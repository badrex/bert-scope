tldr: Humphry Davy conducted experiments on the behavior of flames in various conditions, such as rarefaction and heat, using different combustible gases. He discovered that the intensity of a flame's light depends on the production and ignition of solid matter during combustion, and that heat and light in combustion are mostly independent phenomena. His findings led to the invention of the wire gauze safe lamp used in coal mines.
