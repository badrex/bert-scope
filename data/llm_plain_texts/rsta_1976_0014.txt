tldr: This article discusses the interrelations of fluid transport, deformation, geochemistry, and heat flow in early Proterozoic shear zones in the Lewisian complex. The study examines chemical changes and mineralogical alterations in the shear zones and their relation to deformation and metamorphism. The research provides insights into the evolution of the Earth's crust during the Archaean and early Proterozoic periods.
