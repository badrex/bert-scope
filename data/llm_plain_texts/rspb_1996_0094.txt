tldr: This study investigates the effects of stochasticity and spatial variations on the persistence and coexistence of host-parasitoid communities. The authors introduce various forms of temporal and spatio-temporal noise to a model of host-parasitoid interactions and find that noise can break up large-scale spatial patterns while still maintaining short-range clustering of parasitoids. The results suggest that self-organized spatial dynamics and persistence are robust against the presence of stochastic variations.
