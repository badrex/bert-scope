tldr: This article discusses the circumstances of the transits of Venus over the sun's disk in the years 2004 and 2012. The author, J. R. Hind, calculates the elements of the transit using M. Leverrier's Tables of the Sun and Planet, which are considered accurate. The results show that the transit in 2004 will be visible at Greenwich, while the transit in 2012 will not be visible from that location. The author also provides information on the visibility of the transit from other locations.
