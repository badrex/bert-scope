tldr: The author investigates the rolling motion of a cylinder and the pressure it exerts on a plane. They also study the conditions under which a cylinder will jump or slip on the plane. The findings are applied to the case of falsely-balanced carriage wheels, which have practical importance in locomotive engines. The author highlights the need for careful counterbalancing of cranks to prevent wheel jumping and the potential dangers of using light engines.
