tldr: The authors studied the trypanosome causing disease in humans in Nyasaland and found a naturally infected dog strain with distinct morphological and infectious characteristics. They observed that the strain was almost harmless to monkeys and guinea-pigs, and its morphology differed from the parent species. The study highlights the importance of understanding the variations in trypanosome species and their impact on disease transmission and virulence.
