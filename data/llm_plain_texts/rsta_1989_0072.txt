tldr: The authors develop a simple ocean-atmosphere coupled model to study the evolution of a warm El Niño Southern Oscillation event in the tropical Pacific Ocean. They find that the model captures the overall evolution of oceanic and atmospheric variables for a canonical warm event when certain conditions are met. The model behavior is sensitive to ocean mixed-layer physics associated with external winds, and the authors discuss the possible causes and termination of the warm event based on model results and observations of the Asian monsoon.
