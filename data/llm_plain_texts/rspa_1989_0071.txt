tldr: The authors conducted high-resolution solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance experiments on iron carbonyl complexes. They explored different methods for error estimation in the experimental spectra and examined the relative merits of these approaches. The study provides insights into the molecular motion and intramolecular motions in solid-state chemistry.
