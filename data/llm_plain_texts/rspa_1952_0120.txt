tldr: The authors studied the growth of pre-breakdown ionization currents in nitrogen gas under uniform electric fields. They measured the sparking parameters, such as electrode separation and gas pressure, and found that the graphs of ionization currents against field strength showed both primary and secondary ionization mechanisms. The sparking potentials and distances were in accordance with the growth of current equation. The study provides insights into the electrical breakdown of gases and the role of secondary ionization processes.
