tldr: This article presents a comprehensive study on the coefficient of heat transfer from the internal surface of tube walls. The authors conducted experiments using brass tubes and water, covering a wide range of water velocities, temperatures, tube diameters, and heat flow rates. They found that the heat transfer coefficients were influenced by factors such as fluid density, specific heat, viscosity, and thermal conductivity. The results challenge previous theories and provide valuable insights for improving heat transfer efficiency in practical applications.
