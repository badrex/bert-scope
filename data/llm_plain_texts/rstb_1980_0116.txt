tldr: The authors used incoherent neutron scattering to study the reorientational motions in molecular and liquid crystal phases of t-butyl chloride. They found that the observed scattering law was dominated by the incoherent cross-section of protons, providing valuable information about the nature and dynamics of the reorientation in the solid phases. The results showed that the molecular motions in the different phases were distinct, with crystal III having no quasielastic broadening, while crystals II and I exhibited different reorientational dynamics.
