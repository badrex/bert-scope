tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the hysteresis of iron and steel in a rotating magnetic field. They found that the hysteresis value decreases as the magnetic field strength increases, suggesting that the damping of molecular movement is not due to mechanical friction but rather to eddy currents or fluid friction. This research provides important insights into the nature of hysteresis and its potential applications in dynamo armatures and other electromagnetic devices.
