tldr: The author describes a method to measure the true resistance and electromotive forces of the electric arc using high-frequency alternating currents. The experiments show that the arc behaves more like a non-inductive resistance as the frequency of the testing current increases. The author also discusses the effect of changing the direct current on the resistance and electromotive forces of the arc.
