tldr: The author describes the nesting habits of a type of bees that build cases using leaves and bury them in rotten wood. These bees lay their young in these cases and create separate lodgings for each bee. The author discusses the similarities and differences between this behavior and previous accounts by other naturalists, and provides a detailed description of the specimen found near Windsor.
