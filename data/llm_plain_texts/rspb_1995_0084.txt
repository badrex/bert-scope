tldr: The study investigates the relationship between foraging activity and immunocompetence in bumble bee workers. It found that bumble bees allowed to forage showed lower levels of immunocompetence, as measured by the degree of encapsulation of a novel antigen, than bees prevented from foraging activity. This demonstrates that foraging activity in bumble bees leads to a decrease in immunocompetence, suggesting that the metabolic activity related to foraging competes with self-maintenance functions such as host defense against parasitism.
