tldr: The author conducted research on the involuntary muscular fibre, comparing it to voluntary muscles. They found that both types of muscles have similar fiber arrangements and structures. The author also studied the changes in the uterus during pregnancy, concluding that the enlargement is mainly due to the enlargement of muscular fibers and the addition of new deposits. The involuntary and voluntary muscles are composed of minute threads or fibrils, and their surface appearance suggests a similar construction.
