tldr: The authors investigated the mobility of sodium on tungsten surfaces using a photoelectric method. They found that the sodium forms a patch on the tungsten strip, which decays over time. The decay process is due to the migration of sodium into the bulk of the tungsten along intercrystalline planes. The authors propose that the process is analogous to the diffusion of heat from an instantaneous plane source.
