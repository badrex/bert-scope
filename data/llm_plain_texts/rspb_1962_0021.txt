tldr: The study examines the effects of nutrient deficiency on the nucleic acid and protein content of B. lactis aerogenes. The results show that under conditions of deficiency, the ratios of RNA, DNA, protein, and cell size vary significantly. The cells tend to be smaller, and the synthesis of RNA and protein is affected. The study suggests that nucleic acids and proteins may serve as reserve materials in the cell, and the findings provide insights into the adaptability of bacterial cells to different nutrient environments.
