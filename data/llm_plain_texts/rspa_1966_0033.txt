tldr: This article discusses pion-nucleon scattering and excited nucleon states, analyzing the resonance and inelasticity in the process. The authors use an energy-dependent analysis to determine the amplitudes of the scattering and resolve ambiguities in single-energy analyses. They also explore the potential resonance states and their decay modes, and discuss the limitations of their analysis.
