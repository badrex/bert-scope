tldr: The authors examine and analyze the appendages and habits of the Upper Ordovician trilobite Triarthrus eatoni. They study sixteen specimens from the Frankfort Formation near Rome, New York State, and provide a new reconstruction of the trilobite based on the preserved appendages. The trilobite is believed to have been a benthic animal that walked on the substrate, fed on small organic fragments, and could have caught and squeezed small prey using its formidable array of posterior endites and spines.
