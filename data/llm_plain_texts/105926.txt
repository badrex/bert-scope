tldr: The article describes the dissection and analysis of a monstrous human foetus that lacked several vital organs, including the head, heart, lungs, stomach, spleen, pancreas, liver, and kidneys. The foetus was a result of a pregnancy attended by dropsy of the uterus. The author provides a detailed account of the foetus's anatomy, including the presence of a larynx-like structure, rudimentary limbs, and a mass of unformed tissue in place of the head. The article also discusses the absence of the digestive system organs and the presence of a unique kidney-like structure.
