tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the emission and absorption spectra of mercury. They used photographic plates stained with dicyanin to photograph the spectrum of mercury, extending it to wavelengths up to 11137 A.U. They identified forty-four new wave-lengths in the spectrum of mercury and found that luminous mercury vapour can be photographed at least as far as X = 11137 A.U., providing a new means of investigating the character of such important radiations as X = 10140 A.U. and studying their specific properties.
