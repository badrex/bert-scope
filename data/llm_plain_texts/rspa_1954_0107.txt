tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the abrasion of iron crystals and discovered that during the process, face-centered cubic y-iron forms in the surface regions of the abraded crystals. The transformation of alpha-iron to y-iron indicates a rise in temperature of around 900°C at the surface due to the abrasion. The orientation relationship between y-iron and alpha-iron is different from previously known relationships, suggesting a simpler mechanism of transformation.
