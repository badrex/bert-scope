tldr: This article discusses the role of blue-light-absorbing photoreceptors in plants, specifically focusing on their involvement in morphogenesis and phototropism. The authors present evidence for at least three different blue-light photoreceptors in plants and fungi, one of which is a flavoprotein-cytochrome complex. They also explore the connection between these photoreceptors and the first positive phototropic curvature response in plants, which involves the redistribution of growth in response to light.
