tldr: The authors analyze the crystal structure of quartz varieties, focusing on the differences between the alpha and beta quartz structures. They use X-ray diffraction and intensity measurements to determine the positions of silicon and oxygen atoms in the crystal lattice, providing insights into the structural changes that occur during the transition from one variety to another.
