tldr: The authors present an improved apparatus for ascertaining the sensitiveness of safety-lamps used in gas testing. The new design allows for faster and more accurate testing of different forms of safety-lamps and their ability to detect low percentages of firedamp in the air. The authors also discuss the advantages of non-luminous flames, such as those produced by benzoline, alcohol, and hydrogen, in detecting low percentages of inflammable gas or vapour in the air.
