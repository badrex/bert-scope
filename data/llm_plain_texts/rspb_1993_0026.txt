tldr: 'Researchers successfully transformed primordial germ cells with defective retroviruses and injected them into recipient embryos, resulting in the first example of direct use of primordial germ cells to produce transgenic offspring. This breakthrough could lead to the development of transgenic birds for various purposes, such as research and agriculture.'
