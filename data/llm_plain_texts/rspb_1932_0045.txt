tldr: The study examines the histological changes that occur in potato plants due to certain virus infections, specifically Leaf-roll and Streak diseases. The research focuses on the degeneration of phloem elements and the spread of necrosis in the plants. The findings reveal that the necrotic process starts in the phloem, spreading to neighboring tissues and causing the formation of intercellular spaces and thickening of cell walls. The study also discusses the external symptoms, such as necrotic spotting and leaf drop, and the impact on the plant's overall health.
