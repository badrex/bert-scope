tldr: 'In 1748, an earthquake shook Taunton in Somersetshire. The shaking was described as coming from a distance and lasting for about the time it would take a loaded wagon to travel a hundred yards. The event caused panic among the townspeople, who were still fearful due to a recent earthquake in Lima. The earthquake was felt throughout the region, from the South Chanel to the Severn, and from Exeter to Crookhorn.'
