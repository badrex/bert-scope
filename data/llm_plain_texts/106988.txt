tldr: In 1798, Henry Cavendish conducted an experiment to determine the density of the Earth using a sensitive torsion balance. By measuring the force of attraction between two lead balls and observing the resulting rotation of a wooden arm, Cavendish was able to calculate the Earth's density. His findings helped to improve our understanding of the Earth's interior and the force of gravity.
