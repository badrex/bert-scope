tldr: This article discusses the results of experiments conducted at the CERN Intersecting Storage Rings, focusing on proton-proton scattering at high energies. The main finding is a 10% increase in the total proton-proton cross-section in the energy range studied. The article also reviews the features of the CERN Intersecting Storage Rings and the methods used to measure the cross-sections and elastic scattering.
