tldr: 'This article describes a celestial globe made by Didier L, a master watchmaker in Paris. The globe shows the apparent motions of the Sun, Moon, and stars, as observed by famous astronomers of the time. It moves from east to west in 24 hours, accurately representing the rise and set of the Sun, Moon, and stars. The globe also demonstrates the Sun's and Moon's motions, displaying the phases of the Moon and the inequality of days and nights. This celestial globe serves as a valuable educational tool for understanding astronomical phenomena.'
