tldr: This study investigates how frothy liquids, containing gas bubbles, dampen sound. The author explains that the presence of bubbles in a liquid causes less damping than previously thought. The excessive damping in a liquid with gas bubbles is due to the augmentation of the distortion of the liquid under the variation of pressure. The efficiency of bubbles in damping vibrations increases rapidly as their diameter and the distance between them decreases.
