tldr: This study investigates the effect of load on the heat produced by muscle contractions. The research shows that as the load increases, the extra heat produced by the muscle also increases. This finding challenges the previous belief that the heat produced during muscle shortening is independent of the load and speed. The results provide a better understanding of muscle energy production and its relationship with load.
