revised_title: Andean Andesites and the Growth of Earth's Continental Crust

tldr: This article examines the processes of formation of subduction zone magmas and their role in the growth of the Earth's continental crust, focusing on the Andean region. The authors discuss the various components of the Andean basement, the volcanic history, and the geochemical and geophysical evidence for the origin of the calc-alkaline magmas. They conclude that the addition of mantle-derived magmas above subduction zones is responsible for the growth of the continental crust.
