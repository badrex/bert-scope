revised_title: Symmetrical Systems of Bodies and Gravitational Fields

  - Newtonian Prototypes
tldr: The authors extend the method of successive approximations to construct relativistic models of gravitational fields due to symmetrical systems of bodies. They prove that the critical conditions are satisfied if certain symmetry requirements are met, allowing for the construction of models for Newtonian prototypes with density, stress, and velocity invariant under specific transformations.
