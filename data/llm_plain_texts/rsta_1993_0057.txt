tldr: This article presents a study of tidal mixing fronts in the North Sea, focusing on the Flamborough frontal system. The authors used a combination of modern instruments, such as high-frequency radar, acoustic Doppler current profiler, and drifting buoys, to observe the velocity field and circulation associated with these fronts. They found evidence of along-front jets, cross-frontal convergence, and secondary circulation, which is consistent with previous models and laboratory experiments. The study highlights the importance of understanding frontal dynamics and its implications for the North Sea's ecosystem and bioproductivity.
