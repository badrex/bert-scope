tldr: The authors present a new semi-classical approach to treat atomic collisions involving electronic transitions. They discuss the forced-common-turning-point method to overcome difficulties that arise when classical trajectories in the initial and final states differ significantly. The new method is applied to a model collision process, and the results show remarkable agreement with the exact solution in the distorted wave approximation.
