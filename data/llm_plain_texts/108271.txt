tldr: The author, George Fownes, discovered a new organic salt-base called benzoline from bitter almond oil. Benzoline has similar composition to hydrobenzamide and forms various salts with remarkable solubility properties. The author also discussed the reaction of benzoline with oxidizing agents and its isomerism with hydrobenzamide.
