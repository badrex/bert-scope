tldr: The article presents a method for analyzing planar distributions of dislocations in crystalline solids. The authors introduce a procedure that smears most dislocations into a continuous distribution while keeping those directly involved in the physical phenomenon under consideration as discrete entities. This approach allows for easier solutions while maintaining a high degree of physical reality. The authors apply their method to various dislocation arrays and discuss its implications in the context of cleavage crack nucleation in crystalline solids.
