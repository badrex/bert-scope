tldr: The author investigates the adrenal homologues in the lungfish Protopterus and discovers that the lipine-containing tissue, which is present in the tetrapod adrenal cortex, also exists in the lungfish. This finding suggests that the elasmobranch and tetrapod adrenals could have evolved from this lipine-containing tissue through varying degrees of suppression and migration of the tissues. The study provides insights into the evolution of the adrenal glands in vertebrates.
