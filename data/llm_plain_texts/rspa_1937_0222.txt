tldr: The authors investigate the formation and structure of insoluble cross-linked polymers, specifically focusing on the role of divinyl compounds in the polymerization of styrene and methyl methacrylate. They discover that the efficiency of cross-linking agents depends on the temperature and intrinsic properties of the divinyl molecule, leading to a series of cross-linking agents that produce varying degrees of insoluble polymers.
