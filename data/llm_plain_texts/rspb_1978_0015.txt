tldr: The study investigates the conducting systems in the brain coral Meandrina meandrites, discovering at least three conducting systems: a colonial nerve net and two slow systems. These systems control various behaviors, such as tentacle extension and colony expansion, in response to stimuli like light intensity and food exposure. The research reveals similarities in behavioral organization between corals and sea anemones.
