tldr: This article presents a statistical theory for modeling turbulent flames, focusing on the determination of basic properties in simple flames. The authors develop a set of transport equations for the average velocity and scalar fields, and propose a method to estimate the joint probability density function from its first and second moments. The study aims to provide a more accurate and realistic model for calculating local flame properties, such as temperature, in turbulent flames.
