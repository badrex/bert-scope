tldr: This article describes the construction of a cDNA library expressing proteins of the asexual blood stages of Plasmodium falciparum and the use of human serum to identify antigens. The authors discuss the potential of cloned antigens as tools for analyzing the host-protective immune response and selecting candidate vaccine molecules. They also explore the use of recombinant DNA technology to produce individual proteins for a defined antigen vaccine.
