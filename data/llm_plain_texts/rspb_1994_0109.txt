tldr: The author proposes a new mechanism, called the "good migrations" mechanism, to explain how genetic variation for "good genes" is maintained in populations of migratory birds. This mechanism is based on fluctuating selection caused by changing environments and climatic trends. Migratory birds with more colorful and contrasting plumage are supported by this mechanism, as opposed to the Hamilton-Zuk hypothesis, which predicts the opposite. This research provides insight into the evolution of mate choice and sexual selection in migratory birds.
