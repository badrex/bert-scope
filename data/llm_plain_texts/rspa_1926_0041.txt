tldr: This article investigates the relationship between atmospheric ozone and terrestrial magnetism. The author analyzes ozone observations and magnetic character figures to determine if there is a connection between high ozone levels and increased magnetic disturbance. The results suggest that high ozone levels may precede days of high magnetic character, but further research is needed to confirm this finding.
