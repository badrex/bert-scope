tldr: This article discusses the study of traveling disturbances in the ionosphere, which are temporary variations in the vertical distribution of ionization that show a horizontal progression and a vertical progression downwards. The author examines the experimental results and their interpretation in terms of ionization changes, finding that these disturbances are variations of a compressional type in the atmosphere, affecting the distribution of ionization in the F region.
