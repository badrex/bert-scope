tldr: This article discusses the enzyme Lipase and its role in the hydrolysis of fats. The author describes the preparation of Lipase from castor oil seeds and its activity in promoting the resolution of fats into fatty acids and glycerol. The study also explores the effects of different acids and their concentrations on the enzyme's activity and the importance of understanding enzyme action in animal nutrition.
