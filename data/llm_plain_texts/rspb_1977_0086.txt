tldr: The study investigates the photosynthetic components and activities of nitrogen-fixing isolated heterocysts in Anabaena cylindrica. The researchers found that over 90% of the nitrogenase activity is located in the heterocyst preparations after disrupting the intact filaments. The heterocysts have a unique photosynthetic system that allows electron transport and ATP generation for nitrogenase without concomitant oxygen evolution or competition with carbon dioxide fixation.
