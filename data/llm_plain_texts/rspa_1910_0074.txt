tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the scattering and absorption of homogeneous β-rays and investigated the number of electrons in the atom. They found that the absorption of β-rays is influenced by the scattering of the rays and the loss of velocity during their passage through the absorbing medium. The authors also determined the mean deflection experienced by a β-particle passing through a material and provided a mathematical relationship to calculate the number of corpuscles in an atom.
