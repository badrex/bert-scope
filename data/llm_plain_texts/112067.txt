tldr: The author examines the internal structure and connections of caudate nerve-cells in the spinal cord and brain. They observe peculiar lines within the cells, which they believe indicate the paths taken by nerve-currents. This supports the existence of complete nervous circuits and suggests that nerve-force passes through multiple channels, influencing various lines running parallel to each other.
