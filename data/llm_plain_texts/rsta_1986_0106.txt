tldr: This article presents relativistic AB initio calculations to predict the properties of ionic solids. The authors use correlated wavefunctions and a single determinant atomic orbital approach to model the crystal's wavefunction. The results show that a fully relativistic approach is necessary for accurate predictions, and the method can be applied to other systems in the future.
