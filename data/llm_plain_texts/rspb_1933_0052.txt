tldr: The article investigates the steady state of heat production in nerve tissue during stimulation. It finds that at low frequencies, a steady state is reached, while at high frequencies, the heat production reaches a maximum and then falls off. This indicates that a steady state is not possible at high frequencies due to fatigue.
