tldr: This study investigates the hormonal modulation of circadian neural activity in the crab Carcinus maenas. The research shows that circadian variations in responsiveness to light, reflex responses, and spontaneous activity of neurons are influenced by hormones. Extracts from nervous tissue, particularly eyestalks, can reproduce day-phase characteristics and contain peptidic substances that affect neural activity. The findings provide insights into the role of hormones in regulating circadian rhythms and the underlying neurophysiological processes.
