tldr: The authors study the brittle fracture of solids caused by liquid, solid, and shock impacts. They examine the stress pulses produced by these impacts and find that liquid and shock impacts generate intense, short-duration pulses, while solid impacts have longer impact times. The authors also investigate the role of stress waves and flaws in the fracture process, using high-speed photography to capture the development of fractures. Their findings have practical implications for supersonic aircraft and erosion in high-velocity systems.
