tldr: In this article, Arthur Dobbs describes his observation of a parhelion, a weather phenomenon involving the sun and ice crystals in the atmosphere. He provides a detailed account of the event, including the colors and brightness of the luminous spots, and discusses the reasons for not seeing the typical halo that usually accompanies parhelions. This observation helps to better understand atmospheric optics and weather phenomena.
