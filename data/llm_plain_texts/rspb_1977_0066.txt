tldr: The study calculates the time taken for synaptic potentials to spread from a dendritic synapse to the soma of a motoneurone. It presents a method for estimating electrotonic delay from the shape of an individual postsynaptic potential and discusses the effects of varying motoneurone electrical parameters on electrotonic delay. The findings emphasize the importance of considering electrotonic delay when interpreting the latency of postsynaptic potentials in neural pathways.
