tldr: The author investigates the rate of increase in underground temperature and its implications on the Earth's crust. They collected and analyzed a large number of observations from various locations, including artesian wells, mines, and tunnels. The study aimed to determine a more definite and less elastic rate of temperature increase, which could help in understanding the Earth's crust's thickness and structure.
