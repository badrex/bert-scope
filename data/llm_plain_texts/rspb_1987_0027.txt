tldr: The study investigates the in vitro formation of neuromuscular junctions between adult Rana muscle fibers and embryonic Xenopus neurons. The results show that heterospecific neuromuscular junctions can be formed in vitro, and these junctions resemble those seen during early regeneration of neuromuscular synapses in situ. The study also provides insights into the functional properties of these junctions, including the presence of spontaneous miniature endplate potentials and currents.
