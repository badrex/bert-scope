tldr: In 1761, Nathaniel Bliss observed the transit of Venus over the Sun and recorded his findings in a letter to the Royal Society. He used various telescopes and micrometers to measure the distance of Venus from the Sun's limbs and the diameter of Venus. His observations were made at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich and at Shirburn Castle, providing valuable data for understanding the size and position of Venus and the Sun.
