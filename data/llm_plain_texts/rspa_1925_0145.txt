tldr: This article presents an experimental study on the velocity of sound in various gas mixtures, such as hydrogen, oxygen, ammonia, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and their combinations. The author used a Kundt's double-tube apparatus to produce stationary waves and measure the sound velocity. The results were used to calculate the mean specific heats of the gas mixtures and provide insights into the behavior of sound waves in these mixtures.
