tldr: In this article, Sir Humphry Davy discusses his experiments on the magnetic phenomena produced by electricity. He discovered that an electric current passing through a wire could create a magnetic field, and that this field had a north and south pole. He also found that the strength of the magnetic field was proportional to the amount of electricity passing through the wire. These findings expanded the understanding of the relationship between electricity and magnetism.
