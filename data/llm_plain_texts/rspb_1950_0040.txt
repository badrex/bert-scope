tldr: The author discusses the action of local hormones, specifically acetylcholine and adrenaline, on various biological systems. They explore the excitatory and inhibitory effects of these chemical mediators on skeletal muscles, autonomic ganglia, and other excitable tissues. The author suggests that while acetylcholine primarily affects the neuromuscular transmitting mechanism, adrenaline influences the contractile process. The study provides insights into the complex interactions of hormones and their effects on biological systems.
