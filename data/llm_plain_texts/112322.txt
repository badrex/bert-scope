tldr: This paper presents the results of magnetic observations conducted at the Kew Observatory from 1858 to 1862. The author, Edward Sabine, discusses the disturbances of magnetic declination, diurnal inequalities, and solar-diurnal variations. He compares the findings with those from other stations worldwide, providing insights into the systematic diurnal action of the sun on the horizontal magnet and the earth's position in its orbit.
