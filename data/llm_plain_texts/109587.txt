tldr: The author, Patrick Russell, and Everard Home, studied the unique expansion of the skin of the neck in the Cobra de Capello or Hooded Snake. They discovered that this expansion is a voluntary action due to a set of cervical ribs and specific muscles. These ribs and muscles help form the hood appearance and may facilitate the snake's swallowing of prey.
