tldr: In this article, J. Gomes De Souza expands on his previous work on determining unknown functions evolved under definite integrals. He presents a more general approach using terms of the form A,. Sj'e-(wlmr)dw, allowing for greater flexibility in the function of z. This work contributes to the field of integral calculus and mathematical analysis.
