tldr: This study investigates the effect of temperature on the viscosity of neon gas. The author conducts experiments to obtain accurate data on the variation of neon's viscosity over a wide temperature range. The results provide sufficient data for a reliable comparison of neon's molecular properties, as determined from its viscosity, with values deduced from other sources.
