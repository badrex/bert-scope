tldr: The author discusses ocean currents and their dynamics, focusing on the role of bottom topography in altering horizontal propagation and vertical structure. They propose that bottom-trapped waves, which have a dominant mode with faster currents near the bottom, can be explained by linearized theory and may simplify the observational problem. These waves have a frequency that depends only on the direction of propagation and a vertical extent that varies directly with the horizontal scale.
