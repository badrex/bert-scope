tldr: Charles Darwin presents a theory that the Parallel Roads of Glen Roy and other parts of Lochaber were formed by marine origin. He argues that a sheet of water, gradually subsiding from a higher level, occupied the glens of Lochaber and other valleys in Scotland. Darwin believes that the land was subjected to upward movements and intervals of rest, which led to the formation of the existing structure of the valleys. This theory is supported by the examination of the district of Lochaber by other geologists.
