tldr: 'This study investigates the hybridization of echinoids, focusing on inheritance and environmental factors. Researchers found that by adhering to strict experimental conditions and using fixed and definite characters, they could successfully rear hybrid urchins through metamorphosis. The authors also explored the role of cytology in hybrid development and discussed the influence of environmental factors on the growth and development of hybrids.'
