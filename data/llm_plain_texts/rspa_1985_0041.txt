tldr: The authors present two Fourier-transform deconvolution methods to remove plural scattering from electron energy-loss spectra, improving the sensitivity and accuracy of core-elemental analysis. The Fourier-ratio method is applicable to inner-shell edges, while the Fourier-log method can be applied to any energy-loss spectrum. These techniques enhance the quality of plasmon and core-loss spectra, making it possible to obtain reproducible results from thicker samples.
