tldr: The authors study the thermal instability of a rotating-fluid sphere containing heat sources, developing a theory to embrace modes of convection that are asymmetric with respect to the axis of rotation. They demonstrate that these modes are the most unstable, except for the smallest Taylor numbers. The findings have implications for understanding asymmetric fluid motions within celestial bodies, such as the Earth, and contribute to the study of dynamos and cosmic magnetic fields.
