tldr: This paper investigates the motion of shock waves through non-uniform one-dimensional media, focusing on the interaction between shock waves and contact discontinuities. The author develops a method to calculate the strength of shock waves and reflected disturbances in these situations, providing a useful alternative to numerical methods for solving similar problems.
