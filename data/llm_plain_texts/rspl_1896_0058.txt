tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effects of temperature on electrotonic currents in nerve. They discovered that a rise in temperature temporarily diminishes or abolishes ordinary electrotonic currents, while a decrease in temperature increases the A and K currents. These findings provide insights into the relationship between temperature and nerve conduction.
