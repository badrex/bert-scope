tldr: This study presents a data-based mathematical model to assess the epidemiological consequences of HIV transmission through heterosexual, intravenous drug use, and perinatal transmission in New York City. The model helps to understand the dynamic interaction of these transmission routes and provides insights into the HIV epidemic in the city. The results suggest that long-term precise estimates of the future number of AIDS cases will require accurate evaluation of key variables and their uncertainties.
