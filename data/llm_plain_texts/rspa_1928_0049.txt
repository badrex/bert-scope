tldr: 'This study investigates the exchange of electricity between thunderclouds and the Earth, focusing on the role of point discharge. The author estimates the magnitudes of three factors in the exchange: momentary currents due to lightning discharges, convection currents carried by rain, and continuous currents carried by ions moving in powerful electric fields below the cloud. The results show that point discharge from trees plays a significant role in the upward current, contributing to the Earth's negative charge.'
