tldr: The author analyzes tide data collected at Malta's harbor from 1871 to 1877. They discovered regular luni-menstrual changes in the mean height of tides, as well as well-defined semimenstrual inequalities in both time and height of semidiurnal tides. The study also identifies non-tidal undulations called Seiches, which are formed by waves reflected from opposite shores, and suggests that these oscillations at Malta are genuine Seiches.
