tldr: The authors present a thermodynamic theory of the condensation of supersaturated ion-free vapour, explaining the process of drop formation and the role of embryo drops in equilibrium with the vapour. They also discuss the relationship between the critical size of drops and the rate of condensation, providing a comparison with experimental data.
