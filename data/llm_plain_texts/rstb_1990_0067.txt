tldr: This study investigates the sediment chemistry and atmospheric contamination of lakes in the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Norway to establish patterns of acid deposition. The research uses trace metals, sulfur, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in sediment samples to determine the timing and extent of atmospheric contamination and its impact on lake acidification. The results show that the atmosphere has been contaminated in areas of high recent acid deposition since early last century in Scotland and late last century in southern Scandinavia, while areas of low acid deposition have experienced less contamination.
