tldr: This study investigates the transmission of anti-Salmonella agglutinins from mother hedgehogs to their young and the active immunization of suckling hedgehogs. The research shows that transmission of passive immunity in hedgehogs occurs both before and after birth, with the majority happening after birth. The study also demonstrates that suckling hedgehogs can produce their own antibodies during the period when antibodies are being absorbed from the milk.
