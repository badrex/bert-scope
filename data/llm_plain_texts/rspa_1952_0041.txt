tldr: The authors present a model universe in which stress and mass are interchangeable, proposing a 'gravitationally steady state' where matter is continuously created. This model, based on general relativity, has a contracting phase followed by an expanding phase, with the conversion of stress into matter during the expanding phase. The model universe is in a 'gravitationally steady state' where the density of gravitational mass remains constant.
