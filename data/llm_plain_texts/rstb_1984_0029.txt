tldr: 'This article discusses the molecular and genetic analysis of zein genes in maize endosperm. Zein is the major storage protein in maize and is encoded by a multigene family. The structural genes are located in three main clusters on chromosomes 4, 7, and 10. The rate of zein accumulation is regulated by several positive regulatory loci, and the interactions among mutants show epistatic, additive, and synergistic effects. The genetic organization of zein genes is of interest due to the dispersion of individual zein genes and the presence of genes encoding for zein polypeptides of different molecular weights in the same chromosomal region.'
