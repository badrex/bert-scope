tldr: This study investigates the metabolism of avian development, specifically focusing on the respiratory quotient of the yolk-sac and allantois during the last two weeks of development. The research found that the respiratory quotient of the allantois is initially high but decreases as development progresses. The study also highlights the importance of understanding the large amounts of bound carbon dioxide in the yolk-sac during the last week of development and the challenges in determining the respiratory quotient accurately.
