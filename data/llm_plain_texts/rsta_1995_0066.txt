tldr: This article discusses the stratospheric polar vortex and sub-vortex, focusing on fluid dynamics and its impact on midlatitude ozone loss. The authors argue that the vortex's effectiveness in inhibiting transport of chemicals and air may be questioned, as a large flow of air through the polar vortex could lead to significant ozone depletion in populated areas. The study has implications for understanding the causes of the observed midlatitude decline in stratospheric ozone.
