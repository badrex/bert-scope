tldr: This article investigates the friction between plane surfaces and the limitations of Amontons' law. The author discovers two distinct stages of boundary lubrication and explains how the passage between these stages is determined by the normal pressure. The author also explores the effects of surface geometry, such as using a spherical slider, which reaches a limiting layer of mechanical stability. The study provides insights into the efficiency of lubricants and the role of molecular orientation and pressure in reducing friction.
