tldr: This article presents a two-scale model of a wind-ruffled sea surface that considers the modulation of short waves by long waves, dissipation of short-wave energy by breaking, and regeneration of short-wave energy by the wind. The study focuses on the characteristics of the short waves over the whole profile of the longer waves, providing insights into mean-square steepness, phase and amplitude modulation, and correlation between short and long waves. The model is applied to laboratory and field data, offering valuable information for air-sea transfer processes and remote sensing of ocean surfaces.
