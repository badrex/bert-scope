tldr: The authors studied the magnetic and optical properties of thulium arsenate (TmAsO4) using optical absorption spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance. They found that the ground doublet of the Tm3+ ion is split by a cooperative Jahn-Teller distortion, which produces domains with principal axes along the crystallographic directions [110]. The behavior of the three lowest energy levels was studied with magnetic fields up to 9 T, confirming that the Jahn-Teller splitting follows mean field theory. However, disagreements between optical and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements and crystal field parameters suggest the presence of other interactions.
