tldr: The authors studied the relationship between the atomic number and characteristic frequency of various elements. They found that the product of atomic number and atomic frequency can be expressed as a simple multiple of a definite frequency. This discovery supports the idea that the atomic frequency is related to the atomic number and provides evidence for the validity of quantum theory.
