tldr: The authors developed a correct ray-tracing analysis for interference microscopy of fibers, allowing them to calculate the radial distribution of refractive index for high-speed direct-spun polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fibers. This analysis corrected a significant issue in the literature, where the refractive index profile obtained for a particular fiber depended on the refractive index of the immersion liquid used to make the measurement. The results suggest that PET fibers spun under different conditions have different structural properties.
