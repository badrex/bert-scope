tldr: The authors investigate the Raman spectra of perchloric acid and nitrosyl perchlorate. They find that the spectrum of nitrosyl perchlorate is similar to that of perchloric acid, with the addition of a strong displacement at 2329 cm-1. The results suggest that nitrosyl perchlorate is an anhydrous compound and confirm the presence of the NO+ group in the substance.
