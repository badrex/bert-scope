tldr: This study examines the comparative morphology of the gastropod family Littorinidae, analyzing 122 species and 32 subgenera. Using a cladistic analysis, the researchers identify three main clades and provide a new classification for the family, including diagnoses of subfamilies and subgenera. The research also discusses the evolution of reproductive systems and life-history strategies within the Littorinidae.
