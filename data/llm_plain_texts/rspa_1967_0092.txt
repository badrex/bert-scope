tldr: This article presents complementary variational principles in neutron diffusion theory and uses them to derive new expressions that provide upper and lower bounds for the absorption probability of neutrons in solids. The author applies these principles to a reactor with a uniform isotropic source and demonstrates how they can be extended to more general boundary conditions and other physical and geometrical variational problems.
