tldr: The authors explain the abnormal behavior of electrolyte uptake in ion exchangers by interpreting it quantitatively based on the widespread non-uniformity of counter-ion distribution. They introduce a new treatment for diffusion through widely non-uniform media and provide a continuous variation of counter-ion concentrations, which helps to explain the observed variation of the diffusion coefficient of imbibed electrolyte with concentration.
