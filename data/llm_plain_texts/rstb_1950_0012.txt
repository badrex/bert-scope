tldr: The authors conducted experiments on apices of vascular plants, including ferns and dicotyledons, by isolating them through vertical incisions. They found that despite the diverse histological constitution, similar organographic developments occurred in all the species. This study provides insights into the self-determining nature of the apical meristem, the inception of the vascular system, and the regulated development of the leafy shoot.
