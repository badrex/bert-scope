tldr: The Physics Committee of the Royal Society discussed a proposal by Professor W. L. Bragg to reduce the length and cost of crystal structure papers by archiving detailed data and methods, while publishing only a summary in the journal. The committee recommended trying this approach in crystal physics and spectroscopy for a year, and asked for feedback from authors and referees.
