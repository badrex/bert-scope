tldr: The authors conducted experiments on squid giant axons to study the relationship between displacement currents and the activation of the sodium conductance. They discovered that displacement currents arise from the redistribution of charges involved in the sodium gating system, and these currents are nonlinear. The findings suggest that membrane charges undergo a first-order transition between two states with different energy levels in response to changes in membrane potential.
