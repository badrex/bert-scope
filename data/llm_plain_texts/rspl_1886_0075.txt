tldr: The author proposes the use of fluted carbons for arc lighting to improve efficiency and intensity. Fluted carbons have a larger vertical angle of radiant light and a steadier light due to the localization of the current at the central portion of each carbon. This innovation could enhance the performance of electric arc lights in lighthouse illumination and other applications.
