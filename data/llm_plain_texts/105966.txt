tldr: In this letter, John Ellis and Peter Woulfe discuss their research on the Corallina zoophytes, which were thought to be plants but are now considered animals. They conducted experiments to disprove the claims of other scientists who believed these organisms were part of the vegetable kingdom. Ellis and Woulfe used microscopes and chemical analysis to study the structure and composition of Corallina, proving that they are indeed animals.
