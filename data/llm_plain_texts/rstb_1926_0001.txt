tldr: The author investigates the segmental excretory organs of freshwater ostracods, focusing on their anatomy and development. They discover that the "shell gland" is an ectodermal gland and not a typical segmental excretory organ. The true antennal gland is found in the basal joint of the antenna, with a complicated intracellular efferent duct. This research provides insights into the excretory systems of crustaceans and contributes to the understanding of freshwater biology.
