tldr: The authors studied the hydrolysis of β-stearolactone on the surface of sodium hydroxide solutions to understand the reaction kinetics and mechanism. They found that the reaction is bimolecular and the orientation of the polar groups in the lactone film plays a significant role in determining the reaction velocity. The results can be applied to the study of other heterogeneous catalytic reactions.
