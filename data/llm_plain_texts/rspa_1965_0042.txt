tldr: The article describes the ion technique, a method for studying the stability of viscous flow between rotating cylinders. The technique involves using ions produced by a radioactive source to detect changes in fluid flow patterns. The authors report on experiments performed to test the usefulness of the ion technique and discuss its application to the study of modulated convect flow, finite amplitude range, and other aspects of fluid dynamics.
