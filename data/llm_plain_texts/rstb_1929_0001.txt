tldr: The author describes the discovery and analysis of Clepsydropsis australis, a zygopterid tree-fern with a Tempskya-like false stem, found in the carboniferous rocks of Australia. The plant's unique stem structure and its presence in the southern hemisphere provide valuable insights into the distribution and evolution of the Zygopterid fern family during the Devono-Carboniferous period.
