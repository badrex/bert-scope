tldr: The authors sequenced the amino acid of elephant myoglobin and explored its functional significance. They used the maximum parsimony technique to evaluate the phylogenetic implications of the elephant myoglobin amino acid sequence and compared it with other mammalian species. This study contributes to understanding the evolution of elephants and their relationships with other paenungulate forms.
