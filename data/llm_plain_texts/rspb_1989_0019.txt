tldr: This study investigates the genetics of warning coloration in Peruvian hybrid zones of Heliconius erato and H. melpomene. The research focuses on understanding the genetic system controlling color patterns in these species and how it contributes to speciation. The findings reveal that the genetic system is strongly epistatic, with hybrid offspring having "fuzzier" and more variable patterns than pure races. The study provides insights into the evolution of warning coloration and its role in speciation.
