tldr: This article investigates the instability of internal gravity waves in a Boussinesq fluid. The authors develop a Floquet system to analyze the linear stability of the waves and explore the properties of the system, including parametric instability and resonant wave interactions. They also apply catastrophe theory to describe the surface of marginal stability in the control space of amplitude and wavenumbers. The main conclusion is that internal gravity waves are always unstable, even when their amplitude is small.
