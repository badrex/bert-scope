tldr: The study investigates the silica lorica structure in the choanoflagellate Stephanoeca diplocostata using ultra-high and high-resolution electron microscopy. The researchers found that the costal strips are made of extremely amorphous silica, with T-junctions connecting the strips. Demineralization and cation binding studies provide information about the chemical and physical states of the surface and internal silica environments of the costal strips.
