revised_title: 'Elastic Surface Waves: Behavior and Polarization in Material Symmetry'
semantic_tags:
  - Elastic waves
  - Surface waves
  - Material symmetry
  - Transversely isotropic media
  - Anisotropic elastic media
tldr: This article discusses the behavior of elastic surface waves polarized in a plane of material symmetry. The authors analyze the properties of these waves in transversely isotropic media and explore the existence of secluded supersonic surface waves. They also examine the possibility of one-component surface waves and their relationship to symmetric surface waves.
