tldr: The authors propose a new approach to statistical estimation based on the classical theory of probability. They define the problem of estimation in terms of probability and discuss the conditions required for a satisfactory solution. The authors emphasize the importance of random sampling and the use of probability theory in understanding and analyzing data.
