tldr: The author examines the morphological changes in the oocyte of Antedon, a type of echinoderm, to understand the role of cell structures in cell metabolism. They study the growth and form of the germinal vesicle, chromatin, nucleolus, yolk nucleus, and yolk formation in the oocyte. This research provides insights into the development and function of the oocyte in echinoderms and contributes to the understanding of cell structures and their significance in cell metabolism.
