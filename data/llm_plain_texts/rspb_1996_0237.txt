tldr: The authors present a method to detect genetic markers that are likely to be influenced by natural selection in population studies. They use a statistic called Fst to quantify genetic differentiation and compare it to various population models. The method can be applied to different molecular markers, such as allozymes, RFLPs, and SSCPs, and can help identify genetic variation affected by selection.
