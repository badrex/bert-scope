tldr: The authors, J. Norman Lockyer and W. Chandler Roberts, describe their experiments using the spectroscope to analyze the composition of certain alloys. They found that changes in the composition of an alloy cause changes in the character of lines exhibited in the resulting spectrum, which can be used to determine the percentage of constituents in the alloy. The authors also discuss the accuracy and potential applications of this new method of analysis compared to traditional methods.
