revised_title: Analyzing the Internal Structure of Charged Spherical Black Holes
semantic_tags:
  - Black Holes
  - Gravitational Collapse
  - General Relativity
  - Mass Inflation
  - Cauchy Horizon
tldr: The authors study the internal structure of charged spherical black holes, focusing on the mass-inflation phenomenon at the Cauchy horizon. They find that an approximate analytic solution exists, allowing the mass-inflation singularity at the Cauchy horizon to exist, and they provide evidence that the Cauchy horizon is not preceded by a spacelike singularity.
