tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effect of hydrogen and steam on the flame spectra of carbon monoxide and water gas. They found that adding hydrogen or steam to the burning gas caused a marked decrease in the continuous CO-oxygen spectrum, suggesting that the suppression is not a mere diluent effect. The results support the idea that in a carbon monoxide flame, two sets of independent interactions occur: direct interactions between carbon monoxide and oxygen, and interactions between CO and OH2 molecules.
