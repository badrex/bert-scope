tldr: The authors developed equations to calculate the components of charge in the presence of specifically adsorbed ions and organic molecules at the metal-electrolyte interface. They applied this theory to study the adsorption of thiourea at the mercury-aqueous sodium fluoride interface, finding that thiourea obeys a virial equation of state and that lateral electrostatic forces are negligible except at high coverage. The free energy of adsorption was also evaluated, showing that it consists of an electrostatic term and a chemical term that decreases as the electron density of the mercury surface decreases.
