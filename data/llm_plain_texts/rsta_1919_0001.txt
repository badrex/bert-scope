tldr: This article investigates the regular daily changes of the Earth's magnetism, focusing on the solar and lunar diurnal variations. The author proposes a theory that these variations arise mainly from electric currents circulating in the upper atmosphere, under the influence of electromotive forces produced by the convective motion of the air across the Earth's permanent magnetic field. The author analyzes the data from various observatories and compares the results with previous studies, finding a close parallelism between the solar and lunar diurnal magnetic variations.
