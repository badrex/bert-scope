tldr: This article discusses the process of sex determination in mammals, focusing on the role of the Y chromosome and hormones in determining somatic and germ-cell sex. The author explains how the presence or absence of specific regions on the Y chromosome and the influence of hormones control the development of testes or ovaries, and how germ cells decide to undergo spermatogenesis or oogenesis based on their cellular environment.
