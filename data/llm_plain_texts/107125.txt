tldr: The author, William Hyde Wollaston, investigates the oblique refraction of Iceland crystal and confirms Huygens' theory. He explains the optical properties of the crystal, its refractive powers, and the spheroidal form of light undulations in the crystal. Wollaston's experiments and findings support Huygens' hypothesis, providing a better understanding of the crystal's refraction and the behavior of light.
