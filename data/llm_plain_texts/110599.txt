tldr: 'The article describes a self-registering thermometer and barometer invented by James Coggan, which was bequeathed to the Royal Society. Roderick Impey Murchison explains the construction and functioning of the instruments, which use a siphon tube and a column of mercury to measure temperature and pressure. The devices are attached to a wooden frame and act on iron-floats suspended by a thread, recording daily changes on a ruled paper connected to a clock.'
