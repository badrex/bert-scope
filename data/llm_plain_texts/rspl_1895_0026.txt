tldr: This article discusses the methods used to determine the velocities of ions during electrolysis. The author describes experiments using solid solutions in agar-agar jelly to trace the motion of ions by the formation of a precipitate. The study focuses on the influence of jelly, potential-gradient, and conductivity on the velocities of ions, providing valuable insights into the field of electrochemistry.
