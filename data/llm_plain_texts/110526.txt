tldr: In this paper, Henry Fox Talbot applies a general method of finding the sums of integrals to discover properties of different transcendents, starting with the simplest ones. He demonstrates the application of this method to arcs of circles and conic sections, showing the possibility of finding three arcs with a specific sum, which was previously deemed impossible in the ellipse and hyperbola without adding algebraic quantities.
