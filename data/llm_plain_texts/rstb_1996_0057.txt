tldr: This article discusses the role of transcription factors in the regulation of gene expression during the development of a Drosophila embryo. It highlights the importance of maternal and zygotic transcription factors in establishing the anterior-posterior axis and the molecular mechanisms that control gene expression in a position-dependent manner.
