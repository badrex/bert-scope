tldr: This article explores the use of the spherical shell method to study the electronic structure and local densities of states in particles and crystals. It focuses on the restrictions that local symmetry requirements impose on model clusters and how these restrictions can be used to characterize bulk and surface properties. The author applies the theory to iridium and compares calculated and measured dialectric functions related to the reflectivity of the metal.
