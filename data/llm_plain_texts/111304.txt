tldr: The author investigated the substances obtained by distilling boghead coal at low temperatures. They discovered a colorless and mobile fluid with a pleasant odor, which they believed to be the radical of the butylic alcohol. The study aimed to identify at least four radicals, namely propyl, butyl, amyl, and caprotyl, from the coal distillate using vapor density and products of decomposition as the means of proving their presence.
