tldr: Thomas Coxe conducted an experiment in which he transfused blood from a mangy dog into a healthy dog to study the effects of blood transfusion. The healthy dog showed no changes, but the mangy dog was cured within a fortnight. This experiment suggested that blood transfusion could be a potential treatment for infections in both humans and animals.
