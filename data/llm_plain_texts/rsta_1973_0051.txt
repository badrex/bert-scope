tldr: This article discusses the measurement and interpretation of changes in the Earth's crust during earthquakes. The authors present data from various earthquakes, including the 10 January 1971 New Guinea, the July 1971 Chile, and the 14 July 1971 Solomon Islands earthquakes. They analyze the tilt and strain step amplitudes and velocities associated with these earthquakes, providing insights into the dynamics of the Earth's crust and the propagation of seismic waves.
