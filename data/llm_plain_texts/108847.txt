tldr: 'In this article, G. G. Stokes describes his experiments with electric light and the long spectrum it produces. He discovered that electric light emits rays of high refrangibility, surpassing those from the sun, and that these rays pass through quartz but are absorbed by glass. Stokes also studied the absorption of these rays by various substances and the reflecting power of different materials for these rays.'
