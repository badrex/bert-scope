tldr: The authors analyzed the isotherm data of CO2 between 0 and 150°C and up to 3000 atm using series evaluation methods. They found that the series representation fits the experimental data well and can be used for interpolation purposes. The results were compared with other authors' findings, and the authors concluded that the series evaluation is still valuable for calculating pressure and density at given conditions, even though it may not provide rigid physical conclusions.
