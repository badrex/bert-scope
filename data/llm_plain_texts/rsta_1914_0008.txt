tldr: The author investigates the relationship between atomic weight and spectral series, focusing on doublets and triplets in elements. They propose a theory that the separation of spectral lines is related to the atomic weight term and its impact on the constitution of spectra. The study provides insights into the atomic structure and the periodic table, leading to potential adjustments in atomic weight values for certain elements.
