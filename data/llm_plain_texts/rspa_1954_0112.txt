  - Molecular interaction
  - Physical properties
  - Crystal structure
tldr: This article investigates the energies of interaction and other properties of clathrate compounds, focusing on the heat of formation of various clathrate compounds with -quinol. The author discusses the preparation and analysis of these compounds, and the results are interpreted in terms of the polarizabilities of the enclosed molecules and the number of intermolecular contacts occurring. The study provides insights into the physical and chemical properties of clathrate compounds and their potential applications.
