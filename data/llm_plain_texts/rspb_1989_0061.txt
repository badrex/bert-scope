tldr: The study investigates the oscillation period of miniature endplate potential (MEPP) frequency at frog neuromuscular junctions and finds that it is inversely correlated with release efficacy and independent of acute Ca2+ loading. The research also shows that oscillations in MEPP frequency occur in unstimulated junctions and are not affected by external calcium.
