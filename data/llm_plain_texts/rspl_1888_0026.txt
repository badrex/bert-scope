tldr: This article explores various non-isotropic elastic solids and their applications to problems involving beams and spheroids. The author presents solutions to problems of equilibrium and provides detailed explanations for the dilatation, strain, and stress in different scenarios. The study also includes the effects of rotation on spheroids and the behavior of thin circular disks.
