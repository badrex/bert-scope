  - Group theory
  - Matrix elements
  - Reduced matrix elements
tldr: The authors present a method for calculating matrix elements of operators in a factorized shell using a new basis that simplifies the process and reduces the need for fractional parentage coefficients. They also provide a concise table of reduced matrix elements for electrons, which can be used for various calculations in atomic structure.
