tldr: The authors conducted a study on the gaseous oxidation of aluminium trimethyl, a metal alkyl, and found that the reaction proceeds via a free radical chain mechanism. The initial rate of reaction is proportional to the first power of the alkyl pressure and the square of the oxygen pressure. The main product of the reaction is methane, while no peroxides or volatile oxygenated organic compounds were detected. The observed results can be explained by the formation of dimethoxymethylaluminium as a solid product.
