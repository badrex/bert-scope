tldr: The electric organ of skates is made up of thousands of electric elements, or 'cones,' which are derived from metamorphosed muscular fibers. The organ's structure and function are compared to those of other electric fish, such as torpedo and gymnotus. The author concludes that the method of producing electric organs in fish is still not fully understood.
