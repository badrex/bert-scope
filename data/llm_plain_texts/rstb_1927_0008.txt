tldr: This article reviews the current understanding of the enteric plexuses, which are responsible for regulating gut movements. The author presents new observations and findings using silver and methylene blue staining methods on animal intestines. The study aims to clarify the histological constitution of the enteric plexuses, including the types of neurons and their functions, as well as the role of extrinsic fibers from the sympathetic and vagus nerves. The author concludes that further investigations are necessary to fully understand the complex structure and function of the enteric plexuses.
