tldr: The article presents a theory of steady motion of a long bubble rising through a vertical liquid, showing that the flow speed can be prescribed and a criterion of stability can be used to determine the unique physically significant flow. The author estimates the Froude number for this flow, which is a measure of the velocity of the bubble, and compares it to previous experimental and theoretical values.
