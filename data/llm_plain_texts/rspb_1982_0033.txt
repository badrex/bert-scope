tldr: The authors conducted experiments on hamsters to quantify the adhesion of circulating platelets in venules. They found that platelets stick to the walls of blood vessels, particularly in smaller venules, and that the proportion of platelets sticking to the vessel walls is inversely related to the size of the venule. The study also showed that platelets play a role in inflammation and that they can adhere to vessel walls even in the absence of endothelial abnormalities.
