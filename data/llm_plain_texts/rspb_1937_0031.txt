tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the role of the hypothalamo-hypophysial mechanism in ovulation in rabbits. They found that lesions of the stalk led to degeneration of the pituitary gland and a lack of sexual desire in the rabbits. The author also discovered that electrical stimulation of the pituitary gland and hypothalamus could induce ovulation in rabbits, suggesting a significant role for these structures in the ovulation process.
