tldr: The authors conducted experiments on potato tubers to study their respiratory and carbohydrate metabolism under anaerobic conditions. They found that lactate is oxidized to pyruvate and can be metabolized through the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The outburst of CO2 in air after nitrogen is more complex in low-sugar potatoes at 10°C than in fully sweet potatoes at a lower temperature. The authors also observed changes in lactate, alcohol, sucrose, pyruvate, and α-ketoglutarate in potato tubers under different conditions.
