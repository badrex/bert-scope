tldr: The article demonstrates that spermatozoa produce an organic peroxide when incubated aerobically, leading to lipid peroxidation. This process may cause a decline in respiratory rate and motility, as well as structural damage to sperm membranes, which are early signs of sperm senescence and damage. The authors suggest that lipid peroxidation may be a cause of these issues in moribund spermatozoa.
