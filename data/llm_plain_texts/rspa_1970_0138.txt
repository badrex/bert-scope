tldr: The authors determined the crystal structure of vitamin B12-5'-phosphate, a biosynthetic precursor of vitamin B12, using X-ray diffraction methods. The structure is similar to that of air-dried vitamin B12 crystals, with differences in water molecule positions and acetamide orientations. This research contributes to understanding the molecular structure and biosynthesis of vitamin B12.
