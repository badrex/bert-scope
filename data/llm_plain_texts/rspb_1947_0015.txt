tldr: This study investigates the changes in visual adaptation before and after a change in conditioning stimuli. The researchers found that the liminal test stimulus begins to rise before the conditioning stimulus is applied, and there is a continuous change in the state of adaptation. The study also explores the effects of various factors, such as the intensity and duration of the conditioning stimulus, on visual adaptation and perception.
