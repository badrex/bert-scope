tldr: This study investigates the structure of trigonal lamellar particles of gold and silver using a combination of optical spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The results reveal that these particles have a trigonal outline and a plate-like morphology. The presence of twin planes on {111} is confirmed, which explains the formally forbidden |{422} reflections observed in plan view. The study also discusses possible growth mechanisms for these particles.
