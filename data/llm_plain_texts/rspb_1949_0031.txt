tldr: This article discusses the similarities and differences between chlorocruorin and haemoglobin, two oxygen-binding proteins found in invertebrates. The author argues against using the term "myoglobin" for different types of haemoglobin and suggests using the term "chlorocruorin" for invertebrate haemoglobin. The author also mentions hemerythrin, another oxygen-binding protein found in some invertebrates, and its relation to carbon monoxide exposure.
