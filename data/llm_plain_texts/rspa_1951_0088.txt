tldr: The authors observed spiral growth-steps in n-paraffin single crystals using an electron microscope. Their findings support the theory that crystals grow by spiral growth-steps ending on screw dislocations. The results provide evidence against the long-range migration of molecules over the growing crystal face, as molecules appear to condense only on the developing edge.
