tldr: The author presents a simple and accurate method for measuring surface tension using a micrometer syringe and a brass nozzle. The method is suitable for studying surface tension in various solutions, including those with hydrophilic colloids like proteins, saponins, and soaps. The technique involves measuring the volume of a single drop and calculating the surface tension based on the drop's weight, volume, and the density of the solution. The method provides consistent results and can be used to study the changes in surface tension over time.
