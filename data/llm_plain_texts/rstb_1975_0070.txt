tldr: This article discusses the physics and chemistry of biological recognition, specifically the interactions between antibodies and haptens in solution. The authors use nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to study the structure and dynamics of antibody-hapten complexes. They find that the antibody combining site has a flexible structure that can accommodate different hapten structures, and that the site has both hydrophobic and polar regions. The study provides insights into the molecular basis of antibody specificity and the development of new therapeutic strategies.
