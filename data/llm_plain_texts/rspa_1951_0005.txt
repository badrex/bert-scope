tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate the cross-section of the T(d,n) reaction, focusing on the energy range of 100 to 200 triton energy. They used a thin vapour target and a more reliable method to measure voltage, comparing the yield of alpha-particles from the T-D reaction with the yield of protons from the D-D reaction. The results disagreed with previous resonance formulae and suggested that a conventional theory postulating a reaction at a distance equal to the sum of the nuclear radii could not explain the reaction. The evidence for a low-energy resonance was considered inconclusive.
