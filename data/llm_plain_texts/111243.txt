tldr: 'Professor Stokes developed a method to study the change of refrangibility of light and fluorescence using simple apparatus. The method can be applied by chemists to differentiate between substances. Stokes also discovered that fluorescence can be detected even in weakly fluorescent objects and opened a new field of inquiry in relation to the polarization of fluorescent light.'
