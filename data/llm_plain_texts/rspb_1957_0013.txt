tldr: The author investigates the anatomical basis of olfactory discrimination and the neural mechanisms involved in the sense of smell. They discuss the olfactory pathways, receptors, and the olfactory bulb, emphasizing the relatively simple and direct connections between the olfactory receptors and the brain. The author also highlights the high degree of perceptual discrimination in the olfactory sense, despite its seemingly less complex neural pattern compared to other sensory pathways.
