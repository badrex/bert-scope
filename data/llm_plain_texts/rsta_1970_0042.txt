tldr: The author discusses the evolution of volcanism and tectonic activity in the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, and Ethiopian rifts. They analyze the different types of magmatic products and the style of deformation in these regions, which are related to the regional tectonic history and volcanic evolution. The study reveals that the type of magmatic product can be correlated with the style of deformation, with alkali basalts being associated with vertical uplift, and zones of crustal attenuation hosting volcanic activity characterized by peralkali silicic differentiates.
