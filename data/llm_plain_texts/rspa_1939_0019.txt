tldr: This study investigates the combustion of methane, focusing on the reaction mechanisms and ignition limits. The authors discuss the main products formed during methane oxidation and propose a hydroxylation scheme for the reaction. They also explore the role of chain reactions, including degenerate branching, in the combustion process. The ignition limits for methane-oxygen mixtures are investigated, revealing the presence of multiple flame limits and the influence of temperature on these limits.
