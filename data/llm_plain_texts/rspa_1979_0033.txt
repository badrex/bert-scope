tldr: This study investigates the elastohydrodynamic behavior of various fluids at high pressures, focusing on non-Newtonian effects. The research shows that fluids exhibit complex behavior due to two main factors: the transition from viscous to elastic behavior at high pressures and the nonlinearity between shear stress and rate of shear. The findings suggest that the observed elastic behavior is primarily a viscoelastic phenomenon, and the traction coefficient can be predicted by treating the fluid as a liquid with a nonlinear relation between shear stress and rate of shear.
