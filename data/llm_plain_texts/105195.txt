tldr: Dr. Thomas Heberden's weather observations in Madeira from 1751 to 1753 provide valuable data on barometric and thermometric variations. The study highlights the greatest barometric variation of 9 tenths of an inch and the highest temperature of 80°. The author also records the amount of rainfall, the number of rainy days, and the maximum daily rainfall. These observations contribute to understanding the climate of Madeira.
