tldr: The article investigates the rate of exchange of carbon monoxide and oxygen between red blood corpuscles and the surrounding fluid. The authors found that the rate of uptake of CO by layers of haemoglobin should be less than the rate of combination of CO with haemoglobin in homogeneous solution. The additional slowing observed in corpuscle suspensions was attributed to the limiting effect of diffusion through the membrane surrounding the red blood corpuscles.
