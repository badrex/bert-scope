tldr: This article describes the process of making ice in the East Indies, particularly in Allahabad, Mootegil, and Calcutta. The author, Sir Robert Barker, explains the methods used to collect and freeze water in shallow, porous earthen pans, and store the ice in large pits lined with straw and blankets. The success of the process depends on the weather, with clear and serene conditions being most favorable for ice formation. The author also discusses the potential reasons behind the process's effectiveness and its use in creating frozen treats during the hot summer months in India.
