revised_title: 'Electrostatic and Van Der Waals Forces in Triple-Layer Films'
semantic_tags:
  - Electrostatic forces
  - Van der Waals forces
  - Triple-layer geometry
  - Thin films
  - Aqueous systems
tldr: The authors study the electrostatic and van der Waals forces in aqueous systems with triple-layer geometry, such as free-standing soap films, clay plates, and lipid membranes. They consider the effects of fluctuating surface charges and the relaxation of the diffuse double layer on the forces and provide a general problem formulation and solutions for these systems.
