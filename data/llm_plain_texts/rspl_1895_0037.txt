tldr: This article investigates the relationship between the refractive index of water and its temperature. The authors conducted experiments to measure the refractive index at various temperatures and found that it increases continuously up to the freezing point. The rate of increase changes around the temperature of maximum density, as pointed out by Gladstone and Dale.
