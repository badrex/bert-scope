tldr: Researchers have successfully purified and crystallized crustacyanin, a blue carapace pigment found in lobsters. The pigment has a minimum molecular weight of 36,000, with a carotenoid prosthetic group called astaxanthin. Crustacyanin can dissociate into smaller particles when dialyzed against water, and its absorption spectrum shifts when exposed to different conditions. The apoprotein, without the carotenoid, has a mean molecular weight of about 20,000 and can be reconstituted with the carotenoid. The tertiary and quaternary structures of crustacyanin are stabilized by the carotenoid, which may induce a micelle-like structure with a hydrophobic core.
