tldr: The author investigates the heat produced during a muscle twitch, which is made up of two parts: the heat of activation and the heat of shortening. They found that the heat of shortening occurs simultaneously with muscle shortening, while the heat of activation has its maximum rate at the start of the twitch and decreases over time. The study provides insights into the properties of muscle contractions and the role of heat production in muscle function.
