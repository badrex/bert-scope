tldr: This article discusses the dispersion of pollutants in the atmosphere by large-scale wind systems. The author investigates the travel and dispersion of pollutants using tracer materials such as water vapor, ozone, and radioactive substances. The study focuses on the role of macroturbulence in the dispersion of pollutants and the use of numerical models to predict and analyze the dispersion patterns. The author also highlights the limitations of current methods and suggests improvements for future research.
