tldr: The authors develop a method for estimating the error in quantum-mechanical calculations, focusing on the properties of trace-forming procedures in matrix calculus. They apply this method to various cases commonly used in quantum-mechanical and quantum-chemical calculations, providing a set of independent equations to replace the original equations. This approach allows for a better understanding of the error in approximations and can be used to improve the accuracy of quantum mechanical models.
