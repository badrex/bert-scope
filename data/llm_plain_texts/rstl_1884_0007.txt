tldr: The authors conducted experiments on dog hearts to determine the maximum volume of blood sent out by the left ventricle in a single beat and studied the influence of variations in venous pressure, arterial pressure, and pulse rate on the work done by the heart. They found that changes in these factors affected the heart's efficiency and provided insights into understanding cardiovascular function.
