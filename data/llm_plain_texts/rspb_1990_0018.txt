tldr: This study investigates the role of luminance distribution and spatial frequency composition in the perception of texture segregation. The authors demonstrate that segregation can be affected by factors other than the supposed texton features, such as global luminance contrast and differences in spatial frequency composition. They suggest that these factors may play a crucial role in the perception of texture borders and the segregation of texture areas.
