tldr: The author examines a peculiar type of developmental intersexuality in male domesticated mammals, where individuals have a mixture of male and female structures in their reproductive system. This condition, also known as "pseudo-hermaphroditism" or "tubular partial hermaphroditism," is not uncommon in animals like goats, pigs, horses, cattle, and sheep. The author describes various cases and their anatomical details, highlighting the similarities and differences in external and internal genitalia, gonads, and secondary sexual characteristics. This research contributes to the understanding of intersexuality and its implications in the animal kingdom.
