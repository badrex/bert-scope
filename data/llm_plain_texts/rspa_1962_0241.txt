tldr: The authors measured the quenching rate of ortho-positronium in helium, argon, and freon. They found that the quenching rate in helium is relatively small, which can be explained by a pick-off process. The study provides insights into the interactions between positronium and gas atoms, which is useful for understanding slow collisions of systems with a mass similar to that of the electron. The results can be applied to improve our understanding of gas physics and the behavior of positronium in different environments.
