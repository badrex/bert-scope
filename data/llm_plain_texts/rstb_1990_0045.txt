tldr: The article discusses the role of growth factors in the self-renewal and differentiation of haemopoietic stem cells. It explains how growth factors promote the growth and development of haemopoietic cells in vitro and how they are involved in stromal-cell mediated haemopoiesis. The study shows that different growth factors are needed for various cell lineages and that the balance between self-renewal and differentiation is crucial for maintaining the stem cell pool.
