tldr: The author investigates the role of dislocations in silver halide crystals and their impact on photographic sensitivity. They develop a new experimental system using thin disks of silver halides to study the formation and distribution of internal latent images and photolytic silver particles. The discovery of dislocations within the crystals provides a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the formation of the internal latent image and the growth of visible particles of photolytic silver.
