tldr: This article discusses various experiments conducted by Professor Matteucci on muscle physiology, including heat development during muscle contraction, electric currents in muscles and nerves, and induced contraction. The author presents new findings and challenges existing theories, suggesting that the electric current in muscles during contraction may be different from the current at rest and that the force exerted by muscles is not solely due to the conversion of electrical energy.
