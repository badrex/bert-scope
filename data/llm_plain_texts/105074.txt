tldr: In this article, William Watson describes his experiments on electricity in a vacuum. He explains how the atmosphere, when dry, is the agent that allows electricity to accumulate on non-electric materials. Watson also discusses the importance of air-pump technology in creating a more perfect vacuum, which enabled him to observe the effects of electricity in a vacuum. His experiments showed that electricity could pervade a vacuum and manifest its effects on non-electric substances.
