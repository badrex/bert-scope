tldr: The authors propose a new theory that explains the nuclear forces and magnetic moments of neutrons and protons through the exchange of heavy electrons, which are particles with a mass between that of an electron and a proton. This theory is supported by the observed values of the magnetic moments of the neutron and proton, and it suggests a link between nuclear properties and cosmic-ray phenomena.
