tldr: The authors present exact analytical solutions for the time-dependent charge and potential distributions due to the surface spreading of any initial charge distribution by ohmic conduction on the plane interface between two isotropic insulators. The solutions are applicable to systems of insulators that extend to infinity and can be used to model various practical problems, such as charge behavior on insulator surfaces in a uniform field between two parallel plane electrodes.
