tldr: This article explores the interaction between organic molecules and protein monolayers, focusing on the effects of haemolytic and agglutinating agents on lipo-protein monolayers. The authors establish two types of complex formation between molecules and the monolayer: those that associate through polar groups and those that interact through both polar and non-polar portions. The study suggests possible mechanisms for biological processes such as lysis, agglutination, and sensitization.
