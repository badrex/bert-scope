tldr: The authors describe the purification and properties of glutamine-dependent asparagine synthetase, an enzyme that transfers the amide nitrogen of glutamine to aspartate in Lupinus albus. The enzyme has a high affinity for glutamine and can also use ammonia as a substrate. The enzyme is inhibited by α-oxo acids, and its physiological role is discussed. The authors also investigate the substrate specificity of the enzyme with analogues of glutamine, aspartate, and asparagine.
