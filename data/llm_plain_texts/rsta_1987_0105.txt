tldr: The article discusses the use of satellite-borne measurements to study the composition of the middle atmosphere. The Stratospheric and Mesospheric Sounder (SAMS) experiment on the Nimbus 7 satellite and the Improved Stratospheric and Mesospheric Sounder (ISAMS) on the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite are used to analyze methane and nitrous oxide concentrations. These measurements help to understand the circulation and behavior of the middle atmosphere, as well as the sources and sinks of minor atmospheric constituents.
