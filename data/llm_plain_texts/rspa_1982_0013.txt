tldr: The authors develop a close-coupling theory to calculate the probability of electron detachment in collisions of negative ions with atoms. They focus on the survival probability, differential elastic cross-section, and total detachment cross-section for the H-He system. The results show good agreement with experimental data and provide insights into the detachment process and cross-section calculations.
