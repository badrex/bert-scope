tldr: This article describes the experimental determination of the Richardson gyro-magnetic effect using the ballistic method. The authors discuss the apparatus and techniques used to measure the turning of a vertical cylinder when subjected to a change in magnetization. They also address potential sources of error and methods to minimize their impact on the results.
