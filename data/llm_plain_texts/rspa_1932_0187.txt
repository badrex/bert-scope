tldr: The author, C.D. Ellis, conducted experiments on the radioactive source thorium B in transient equilibrium with its products. They studied the y-ray and a-particle levels associated with thorium B and thorium C bodies. The research provided evidence in favor of the connection between y-rays and a-particle levels in the nucleus. The author also identified new lines in the (3-ray spectra and discussed the complexities of the lines in the region Bd-E.
