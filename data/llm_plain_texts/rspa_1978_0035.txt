tldr: The authors expose the internal microstructure of certain polyethylene spherulites grown very slowly, revealing a highly regular texture with ridged sheets of alternating {201} facets. This lamellar organization mimics a fibrous habit with lateral segregation of slower crystallizing species. The findings provide insights into the structure and growth of spherulites in polyethylene, contributing to the understanding of crystallizable synthetic polymers.
