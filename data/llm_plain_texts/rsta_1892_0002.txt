tldr: The author investigates the time-relations of the excursions of the capillary electrometer and its applications. They discover that the velocity of the movement is affected by electrical resistance and mechanical friction. The author also finds that the electrometer is practically dead-beat, meaning it stops moving the moment the source of electromotive force is withdrawn. They propose methods to analyze irregular changes in electromotive force using the capillary electrometer.
