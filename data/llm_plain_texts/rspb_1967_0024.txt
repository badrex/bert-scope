tldr: The authors synthesized and tested new kinetin analogues for their phytokinin activity using three biological tests: wheat coleoptile growth stimulation, wheat leaf senescence retardation, and tobacco pith cell division activity. Four compounds were found to have activity similar to kinetin. The study also discusses the possibility that the property of phytokinins to behave as reducing agents is related to their biological activity.
