tldr: The author explores new regular compound tessellations, specifically focusing on hyperbolic geometry. They discover two new hyperbolic regular compounds, {8,4}[4{8,8}] {4,8} and {8,3}[10{8,6} 2{8,3}], expanding the understanding of regular compound tessellations in mathematics. These tessellations have different degrees of regularity, and their study contributes to the broader field of geometry and symmetry.
