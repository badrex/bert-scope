tldr: This article examines the impact of transverse effects and noise on optical instabilities in bistable systems. The authors analyze a simple model that incorporates a Gaussian radial variation of the electric field and find that the most favorable situation for self-pulsing instabilities involves atomic and cavity detunings with opposite signs. They also explore the role of noise in the onset of self-oscillatory instabilities, showing that it plays a significant role and is governed by an equation similar to the Risken equation for lasers.
