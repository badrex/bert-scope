tldr: The authors investigate the effects of heterogeneity in the parasite population on the transmission dynamics of malaria. They demonstrate that simple models of strain heterogeneity can generate periodic behavior due to the interaction between parasite strains and host immunological defenses. Cross-immunity plays a crucial role in both bringing strains into competition and coupling the dynamics of the system. The study provides insights into understanding and managing malaria transmission.
