tldr: This article critiques Ullman and Schechtman's (1982) proposed gain control mechanism for perceptual adaptation and normalization. It demonstrates that the mechanism is not new and has been used in various perceptual, cognitive, and learning data since its introduction in the 1960s. The author also explains how the mechanism can be applied to a wide range of problems in perception, cognition, and motivated behavior through the use of gated dipole fields.
