tldr: This study examines the life statistics of Royal Society fellows and the effects of cerebral anaemia on the body. The author found that under this condition, the vasomotor and cardio-inhibitory centres act antagonistically. Adrenaline in small doses introduced into the head circulation causes a slowing of the heart and a fall in blood pressure, which is due to an increased circulation through the medullary centres.
