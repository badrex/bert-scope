tldr: This article presents a case study of a young woman with a severe dropsy, a medical condition characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the body. Despite undergoing numerous paracentesis operations to remove the excess fluid, the cause of the dropsy was traced back to a disease in the left ovary. The patient maintained a good appetite and remained cheerful throughout her illness, visiting friends and walking short distances. The case study serves as a record of a unique medical case and the various treatments employed.
