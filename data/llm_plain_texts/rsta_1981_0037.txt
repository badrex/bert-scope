tldr: The article discusses the use of high-resolution 13C and 15N nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques for analyzing the structure and dynamics of various complex polymers and materials. Examples include the characterization of carbon fiber precursors, cross-linked resins, lignin metabolism, and polymeric blends. These non-destructive analyses provide valuable information about molecular structures and chemical reactions in solid-state materials.
