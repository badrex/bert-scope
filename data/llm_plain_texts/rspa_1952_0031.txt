tldr: The Atomic Energy Research Establishment, located at Harwell, focuses on conducting research and development in the fields of chemistry, physics, metallurgy, and engineering for the atomic energy program. The establishment aims to produce radioactive and stable isotopes, distribute them, and encourage their applications, as well as investigate the potential of nuclear energy as a power source. The research is carried out through various divisions and groups, focusing on nuclear constants, neutron fission, capture, and scattering cross-sections, neutron-absorbing properties of metals, and neutron diffraction for crystal structure measurements.
