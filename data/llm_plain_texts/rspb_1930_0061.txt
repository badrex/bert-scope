tldr: The authors conducted experiments on rabbits and ferrets to study the effects of oestrin on the female reproductive cycle. They found that large amounts of oestrin cause the development of the uterus and mammary glands, but do not induce the changes typical of the luteal phase. The results suggest that oestrin is not antagonistic to the action of the luteal hormones.
