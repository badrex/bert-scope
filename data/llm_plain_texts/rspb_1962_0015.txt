tldr: Researchers developed an artificial placenta apparatus that provides essential requirements for a fetus without violating physiological principles. The apparatus maintains the foetal circulation and allows for gas exchanges, electrolyte excretion, and nutrient administration. The authors successfully kept pig and human foetuses alive and active for up to 7 hours, enabling further observations and research.
