semantic_tags:

tldr: This article develops the theory of weak functions without using test functions or topology, focusing on weak convergence. It simplifies the fundamental techniques of multiplication, division, and passage to a limit, and applies the theory to Fourier transforms. The paper is restricted to weak functions in one dimension, with the extension to several dimensions planned for a later publication.
