tldr: The authors apply the methods of Courant and Hilbert to study the asymptotic distribution of eigenvalues in Schrodinger equations. They prove that the W.K.B. formula gives the asymptotic distribution in one-dimensional cases and provide analogous formulae for two and three-dimensional cases. This work extends the understanding of eigenvalue distribution in quantum mechanics and mathematical physics.
