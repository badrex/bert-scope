tldr: The authors study a Dirac Hamiltonian describing massless spin-half particles (neutrinos) moving in a plane under the action of a 4-scalar potential. They find that the system does not possess time-reversal symmetry and demonstrate that the eigenvalues of the system are distributed according to the statistics of the gaussian unitary ensemble of random-matrix theory. This provides a simple and natural way to break quantal time-reversal symmetry without magnetic fields.
