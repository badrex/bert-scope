tldr: This article investigates the levels in a horizontally stratified ionosphere where coupling between characteristic waves becomes infinite, leading to critical coupling and breakdown of ray-theory approximations. The study extends the problem of coupling to include oblique incidence, using the Booker quartic to analyze propagation in the ionosphere. The article focuses on determining the conditions under which the two roots of the quartic are equal and finding the levels in the ionosphere where reflexion occurs.
