tldr: The authors conducted experiments using electron impact spectroscopy to study the ejected electron spectra of K and Ca. They compared their findings with Hartree-Fock calculations and identified most of the energy levels, providing a detailed analysis of low energy lines. This research contributes to the understanding of atomic physics and the identification of energy levels in atoms.
