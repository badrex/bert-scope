tldr: This article discusses the electrochemical equivalent of silver and the absolute electromotive force of Clark cells. The authors conducted experiments to determine the ratio of the square root of the double attraction of coils to the rate of silver deposit, which led to the calculation of the electrochemical equivalent in CGS measure. They also examined various Clark cells and their electromotive force, finding that they provide a convenient standard for electromotive force.
