tldr: 'The article discusses the structure and mechanism of H-ras p21, a low molecular mass GTPase involved in signal transduction. The author reviews the interaction between guanine nucleotides and the active site of the protein, focusing on the conformational changes induced by GTP hydrolysis. The study also examines the role of H-ras p21 in cellular regulation and its potential implications in oncogenic transformation.'
