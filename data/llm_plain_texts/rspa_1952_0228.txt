tldr: The authors developed a new apparatus to measure the energy stored in a metal during plastic deformation. They heated an annealed and a deformed specimen, of equal weight, by small heating elements inside each specimen. The stored energy was calculated from the difference in the powers supplied to the specimens using a differential wattmeter. The authors found that small amounts of impurities can cause significant differences in the recrystallization temperatures and the shapes of the curves showing the release of stored energy, but the total stored energy is not greatly affected.
