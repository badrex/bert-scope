tldr: This article discusses the physics, chemistry, and applications of thermotropic liquid crystals, focusing on the structural studies of nematic and smectic phases. The author reviews information about liquid crystal phases obtained through light scattering and high-resolution X-ray scattering. The nematic-smectic transition is analyzed, and the de Gennes-McMillan model is found to be correct. The smectic A to smectic transition exhibits classic mean-field behavior, and preliminary results of a study of a nematic-smectic A transition in a lyotropic material indicate similarities to thermotropic materials.
