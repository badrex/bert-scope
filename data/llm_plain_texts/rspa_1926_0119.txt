tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the number of particles in the beta-ray spectra of Thorium B and Thorium (C + D). They found that the continuous spectrum of Thorium (C + D) was much larger than that of Thorium B. The authors concluded that the continuous spectra of Thorium B and Thorium (C + D) were similar to those of Radium B and Radium C, respectively, and were formed by nuclear electrons ejected in the disintegration with varying velocities.
