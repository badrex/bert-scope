tldr: 'John Bartram, a natural observer from Pennsylvania, discovered two types of clay wasp nests built by different species of wasps. These nests are constructed by the wasps using clay and are used to protect their eggs and young. The wasps catch spiders to feed their offspring, but do not kill the spiders, ensuring they stay fresh until the eggs hatch. The nests are an example of the wasps' intricate construction and musical communication skills.'
