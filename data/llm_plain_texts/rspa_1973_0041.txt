tldr: This article presents a solution to the characteristic initial value problem in general relativity for a perfect fluid with axial symmetry. The study focuses on the behavior of the system using the formalism of Bondi et al. and the conservation condition. The development of the system is determined by giving certain data on an initial null surface and specifying two arbitrary functions of one variable. The solution is subject to the conditions that the speed of sound in the fluid is different from the speed of light in vacuum and the supplementary equations are satisfied.
