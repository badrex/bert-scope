tldr: This article discusses the importance of meteorites in understanding the formation and evolution of the Solar System. It focuses on chondrites, which are stony meteorites that provide valuable information on the early stages of planetary formation. The article also explores the role of isotopes, such as 244Pu and 26Al, in dating and understanding the history of meteorites and the Solar System. Additionally, it touches upon the ongoing debate about the source of heat that caused asteroid-sized bodies to melt and the possible existence of undiscovered superheavy elements or stellar condensates in meteorites.
