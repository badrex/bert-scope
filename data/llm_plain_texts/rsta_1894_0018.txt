tldr: The author conducted experiments using electrolytic iron to study its photographic arc spectrum and compare it with the solar spectrum. They aimed to eliminate impurities and accurately identify iron lines in the spectrum. This research was essential for understanding the sun and stars, as well as for distinguishing between lines due to iron and other elements.
