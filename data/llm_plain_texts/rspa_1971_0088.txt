tldr: The authors studied the photochemistry of piperidinoanthraquinones, a class of aminoanthraquinones, and found that their longest wavelength absorption bands are intra-molecular charge-transfer (c.t.) in type. Upon protonation of the 1-piperidino derivative, the longest wavelength band becomes mr* and exhibits different photochemical behavior. The authors also examined the photochemistry of the compounds in aqueous-alcoholic solutions under various pH conditions and discussed their relevance to the mechanism of phototendering of cellulose materials by vat dyes.
