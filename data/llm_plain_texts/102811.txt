tldr: Dr. Martin Lister discusses his experiment on pouder'd blues and its relation to fevers. He explains that the obstruction of glands can cause fevers and that crude or vitiated chyle can be a factor. Lister shares his experiment's success with Dr. Musgrave, who also conducted similar experiments at Oxford. Lister emphasizes the importance of doing justice to one's own work and maintaining a fair representation of experiments in scientific interpretations.
