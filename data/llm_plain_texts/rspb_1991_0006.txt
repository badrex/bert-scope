tldr: The seaweed Ascophyllum nodosum increases its strength and toughness in response to simulated herbivore damage, reducing the probability of breakage. This response is particularly advantageous for wave-swept macroalgae, as herbivore damage often leads to breakage and loss of tissue. The induced changes in the mechanical properties of the seaweed may involve altering cell wall thickness, alginate structure, or packing density of load-bearing cells.
