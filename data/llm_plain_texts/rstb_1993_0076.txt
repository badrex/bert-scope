tldr: 'The article discusses the structure and function of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, a potential second messenger system involved in growth control. The enzyme is found in multienzyme signaling complexes and generates novel phospholipids, which play a role in signal transduction pathways. The interaction between the PI 3-kinase and growth factor receptors is crucial for understanding its role in diverse cellular processes.'
