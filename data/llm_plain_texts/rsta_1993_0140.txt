tldr: The authors present a macroscopic dynamical theory of solids that incorporates the effect of atoms and their arrangements, focusing on the continuous distribution of dislocations in crystal plasticity. The theory uses a triad of directors to represent lattice vectors and includes additional momentum-like balance laws for the rate of change of director fields. This approach provides a better understanding of plastic deformation, dislocation density, and constitutive response functions for both viscoplasticity and rate-independent plasticity.
