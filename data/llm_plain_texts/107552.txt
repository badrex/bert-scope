tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the effect of felling season on the durability of oak tree alburnum. They found that alburnum from winter-felled trees had a higher durability than that from spring-felled trees. The author suggests that removing bark in spring and allowing trees to stand until winter can improve the durability of alburnum in oak trees.
