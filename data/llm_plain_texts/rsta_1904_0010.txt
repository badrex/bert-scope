tldr: The author investigates the dependence of the photo-electric current from a metal surface illuminated by ultra-violet light on the pressure and nature of the gas in which the illuminated surface is enclosed. They compare the currents in different gases and pressures, finding that the current increases rapidly with the potential difference up to a certain value, after which the increase is much more gradual until another critical value is reached.
