tldr: This study investigates the relationship between arousal levels and the activity of hypothalamic neurons in unanesthetized, freely moving rats and rabbits. The researchers found that the modal interval of neuronal activity reflects the animal's behavioral state, with shorter intervals during sleep and longer intervals during alarm. The mean frequency of discharge did not change systematically with arousal levels.
