revised_title: 'Growth and Propagation Mechanisms of Explosions in Liquids and Solids'
semantic_tags:
  - Explosives
  - Detonation
  - Impact initiation
  - Liquid explosives
  - Solid explosives
tldr: The authors study the birth and growth of explosions in liquids and solids initiated by impact and friction. They discover that local hot spots play a significant role in the growth and propagation of explosions, and that the mechanisms for initiation and propagation are similar for both liquid and solid explosives. The research provides insights into the fundamental processes of explosions and their applications in various fields.
