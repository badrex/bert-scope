tldr: The article discusses the possible role of carotenoid pigments in protecting against photooxidation in eyes and photoreceptor cells. Carotenoids, present in many eyes and photoreceptors, absorb dangerous short-wavelength light, potentially protecting against the damaging effects of light and oxygen. This protection is essential for photoreceptor cells, which must be accessible to light while also containing other pigments that could lead to photooxidative processes.
