tldr: This article discusses the post-embryonic development of the myriapod Julus terrestris. It explains how somites divide into two parts, forming the coelom and generative organs. The study also covers the development of the nervous system, tracheal system, stink glands, heart, fat bodies, and eye-spots. The author concludes that each double segment in Julus terrestris represents two complete segments, with dorsal plates having fused together.
