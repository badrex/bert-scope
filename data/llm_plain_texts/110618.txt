tldr: The author discovered a method to convert chlorates and nitrates into chlorides and vice versa, which allowed for accurate determination of equivalent numbers in the theory of definite proportions. This method was applied to various salts, leading to the determination of equivalent numbers for chlorine, nitrogen, potassium, and sodium, which supported Dr. Turner's views and challenged the hypothesis that all equivalent numbers are simple multiples of hydrogen's equivalent number.
