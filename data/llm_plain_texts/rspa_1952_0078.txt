  - Adiabatic Hypothesis
tldr: The authors studied inelastic collisions between ions and atoms, focusing on negative-ion detachment processes. They measured charge-exchange cross-sections for various elements and found that the cross-sections for ionization by positive and negative ions are small at low energies. The study also attempted to infer the energy levels and electron affinities of the atoms involved and provided a quantitative investigation of the adiabatic hypothesis.
