tldr: This article discusses the importance of understanding and predicting the leaching of organic and inorganic solutes in soil for assessing soil productivity and environmental pollution. The authors emphasize the need for new models to describe macropore flow, kinetic-equilibrium sorption processes, and spatial variation in soil properties. They review classical leaching models and highlight the limitations of empirical relations and mass balance models. The article calls for increased experimental studies to improve leaching models and provide accurate and meaningful quantitative estimations of chemical leaching in the environment.
