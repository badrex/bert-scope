tldr: The author, John Ranby, describes the dissection of an eye with a cataract and discusses the causes and nature of the opacity. He examines the eye's humors and finds that the crystalline humor is the main cause of opacity. Ranby also explores the role of inflammation in cataracts and disagrees with the widely accepted idea that cataracts are caused by a serous acid. This study contributes to the understanding of cataracts and their treatment.
