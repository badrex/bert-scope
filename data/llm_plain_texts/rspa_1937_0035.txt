tldr: This study investigates the thermal decomposition of methyl nitrite and its products, such as nitric oxide and carbon monoxide. The authors found that the decomposition process is not a simple first-order reaction and involves multiple reactions and intermediates. The results provide a better understanding of the complex nature of thermal decomposition processes.
