tldr: This article presents a study on the relationship between the sun's altitude and the chemical intensity of sunlight. The authors used sensitive paper to measure the chemical action of direct and diffused daylight at different altitudes. They found that the chemical intensity of sunlight decreases as the sun's altitude decreases, and they also discovered that the place of equal chemical illumination occurs at an altitude of 18 degrees. This research helps to understand the effect of sunlight on atmospheric chemistry and the variation in chemical intensity at different altitudes.
