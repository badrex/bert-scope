tldr: 'The author discusses the geological structure of Antarctica and its role in understanding the evolution of Gondwanaland. Antarctica's geological position has allowed for the correlation of events throughout Gondwanaland and the deduction of possible relations between geological developments in the supercontinent and in the Pacific. The author highlights the contrast between tectonic changes in the interior of Gondwanaland and extensive deformation within the Ross and younger orogenic belts close to the Pacific, providing insights into the pre-break-up deformation of Gondwanaland and movements of the surrounding ocean floor.'
