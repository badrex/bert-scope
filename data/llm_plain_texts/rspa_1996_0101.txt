tldr: The authors investigated the use of ultrasonic reflection coefficient measurements to characterize oxide layers in adhesive joints. They found that oblique incidence reflection coefficients are the most promising technique for detecting interlayer properties in adhesive joints. The study focused on the reflection coefficients from aluminum/epoxy interfaces with different interlayers, and the results showed that the technique is sensitive to changes in interlayer thickness and porosity.
