tldr: The Jodrell Bank Experimental Station observed and analyzed radar echoes from Russian Earth satellites and their carrier rockets using a 250-foot radio telescope. The observations were challenging due to the presence of meteor and auroral echoes, but the team successfully confirmed radar echoes from the satellites and calculated their effective scattering cross-sections. The study highlights the difficulties in locating the targets and the importance of understanding confusing factors like meteor echoes and aurorae in space exploration.
