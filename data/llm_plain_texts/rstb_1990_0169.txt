tldr: This study investigates the relationship between colour vision and object vision in dragonfly insects, specifically examining the spectral sensitivity of self-motion detectors and object-motion detectors. The results suggest that colour vision is associated with object vision, and that these neurons are not colour blind but do not necessarily distinguish colours. The findings provide insights into the visual processing mechanisms in insects and the role of colour coding in object vision.
