tldr: "The author, David Brewster, investigates the polarization of light by refraction and establishes the laws governing this phenomenon. He discovers that the action of each refracting surface on polarized light causes a physical change in the refracted pencil, bringing it closer to complete polarization. Brewster also develops a formula to determine the angle of inclination of the planes of polarization and the quantity of polarized light in the refracted pencil."
