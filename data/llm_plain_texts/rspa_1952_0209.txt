tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the photolysis of solid potassium azide and found that the mechanism of decomposition involves the production and trapping of excitons. They confirmed the theory by measuring the photoconductance, absorption bands, and the rate of photolysis. The quantum yield of potassium azide was found to be about 0.02, similar to that of barium azide under similar conditions. The study provides insights into the solid-state chemistry of azides and the role of excitons in their decomposition.
