tldr: The study investigates the chorioallantoic membrane reaction in chick embryos when exposed to adult chick leucocytes. The research focuses on the'single-hit' hypothesis, which suggests that each focus on the chorioallantoic membrane results from the activity of one single cell. The study confirms the relationship between the number of foci and the number of cells in the inoculum, supporting the'single-hit' hypothesis. The findings could be useful for isolating clones of immunologically competent cells.
