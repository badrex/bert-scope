tldr: This study investigates oogenesis in lorises, specifically Loris tardigradus lydekkerianus and Nycticebus coucang. Researchers found that oogonia and non-follicular oocytes were present in all ovaries, and the number of primordial germ cells varied in relation to the different phases of the reproductive cycle. The findings suggest that oogenesis in postnatal lorises may be under endocrine control.
