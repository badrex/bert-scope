tldr: This article explores the relationship between optical dispersion, selective reflection, and infra-red natural frequencies. The author examines various dispersion formulae for rock-salt, sylvite, and fluorspar, and applies these findings to crystal dynamics. The study also discusses the importance of considering the absorption coefficient when comparing experimental values with dispersion formulae.
