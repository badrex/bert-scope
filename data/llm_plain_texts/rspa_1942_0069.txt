tldr: The authors discuss the possibility of nuclear energy levels being influenced by rotational motions. They explore two types of rotation: the rotation of the whole nucleus and the rotation of particles around the nucleus. The authors apply the rigid rotator formula to calculate energy levels and compare their findings with empirical data from various radioactive nuclei. The results suggest that rotational motions may play a role in determining nuclear energy levels.
