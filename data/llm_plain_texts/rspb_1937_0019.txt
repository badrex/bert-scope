revised_title: 'Investigating Electrical Responses of the Cochlea and Auditory Tract to Phase Reversal in Musical Tones'

tldr: The authors investigated the electrical responses in the cochlea and auditory tract of a cat when exposed to phase changes in a continuous musical tone. They found that the phase change beat was due to the change of phase alone and not any other disturbance in amplitude or frequency. This study aimed to shed light on the vibrating elements of the internal ear responsible for initiating nervous impulses and to compare the response to phase changes in the tract potentials with the cochlear potentials to better understand their origin.
