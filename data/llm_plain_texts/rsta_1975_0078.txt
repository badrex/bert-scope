tldr: The authors discuss the observations of P-Cygni profiles in hot stars using the Copernicus satellite telescope. They analyze the resonance lines of various ions in these stars and find that they exhibit characteristic P-Cygni profiles, indicating the ejection of material from the stars. The study provides insights into the behavior of hot stars and their spectral properties.
