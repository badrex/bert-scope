tldr: This article by Robert Boyle explores various properties of sea water, including its salt content, gravity, depth, and bottom composition. It also discusses the effects of sea water on putrefaction, the ejection of dead bodies and objects, and the medical and agricultural benefits of sea water. The author shares observations on the changes in sea water properties as he sailed towards the Caribbean and discusses the communication of seas through straits and subterranean channels.
