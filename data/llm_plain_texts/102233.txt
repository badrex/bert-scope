tldr: The author describes the dissection of a bitch whose uterus had filled with bones and flesh from a previous conception, and how the eggs from a second conception were attached to various parts of the abdomen. This observation supports the theory of animal reproduction through eggs, which was being challenged by other scientists at the time. The author also compares the process of animal reproduction to the growth of plants from seeds, highlighting the care and complexity involved in creating new life.
