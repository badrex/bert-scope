tldr: The authors calculate the cross-section for the inelastic scattering of electrons by atomic nuclei, assuming the process arises from the electromagnetic interaction between the electron and nuclear charge. They use the relativistically invariant theory of the retarded interaction of two charged particles and the Fermi theory of beta-decay to estimate the cross-section for the excitation of nuclei. The study focuses on electric dipole, electric quadrupole, and magnetic dipole transitions and provides a theoretical framework for understanding the process of nuclear excitation by electrons.
