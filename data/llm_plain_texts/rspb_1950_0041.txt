revised_title: 'Exploring the Stereochemical Specificity of Local Hormones and Enzymes'
semantic_tags:
  - Enzyme kinetics
  - Hormone action
  - Stereochemistry
  - Amino-acid decarboxylases
  - Local hormones
tldr: The author discusses the action of local hormones and the stereochemical specificity of enzymes, particularly amino-acid decarboxylases. They explore the importance of chemical specificity in understanding the relationship between enzymes and substrates, as well as the specific action of local hormones. The author also examines the role of stereochemistry in enzyme-substrate interactions and its potential applications in understanding the action of local hormones.
