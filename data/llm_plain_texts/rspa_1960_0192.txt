tldr: This article investigates the electrical properties of crystal compounds formed between graphite and alkali metals, focusing on the role of electron donors. The authors found that the electrical resistance and thermoelectric power of graphite decrease when it forms crystal compounds with alkali metals. The results indicate a significant difference between the effects of electron donor and acceptor groups on the electrical properties of graphite.
