tldr: The author conducted an experiment to determine if the colors of certain caterpillars are due to modified plant pigments derived from their food. They found that by feeding caterpillars with plant material lacking color, the larvae turned pale, indicating that the coloration is indeed influenced by the pigments from their food. This discovery sheds light on the role of plant-derived pigments in the coloration of insect larvae.
