tldr: The study examines the post-glacial history of British vegetation by analyzing the deposits of the western margin of the East Anglian Fenland at Holme Fen and the former Whittlesey and Trundle Meres. The research uses stratigraphic survey, pollen analysis, plant identification, and radiocarbon dating to understand the origin and character of the deposits. The findings reveal the development of alder fen-woods, eutrophic Cladium-dominated fen, and ultimately, acidic raised bog. The study also provides insights into the effects of Neolithic and Bronze Age activities on the local vegetation and landscape.
