tldr: This article investigates the constitution of alloys containing aluminium, copper, and zinc with high percentages of zinc. The authors determine the equilibrium diagram and phase transformations of these alloys through thermal analysis, microscopy, and electrical conductivity measurements. The study provides insights into the properties and behavior of these ternary alloys, which are important for practical applications.
