tldr: The author examines the structure and function of the nervous system in Archachatina marginata, a large species of snail. They focus on the ganglia of the central nervous system, pallial, visceral, and cervical nerves, and describe their histology, cell sizes, and nerve fibers. The author also discusses the possibility of synaptic connections between medium-sized nerve cells and giant axons, as well as the active and contractile nature of peripheral nerves. This study provides insights into the nervous system of gastropods and contributes to the understanding of their neurophysiology.
