tldr: The author compared the accuracy of different methods for determining the dew point, including Daniell's hygrometer and wet and dry-bulb thermometers. They found that Mr. Glaisher's hygrometrical tables, based on Greenwich observations, were highly accurate. The author also shared their own evaporation and precipitation observations from Whitehaven.
