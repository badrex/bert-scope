tldr: Researchers discovered that sand dollars have a unique way of growing their teeth by periodically loosening them using a special type of tissue called mutable collagenous tissue. This allows the teeth to advance along the tooth slide, enabling the sand dollars to maintain their ability to crush sand particles during ingestion. The process could be under nervous control, as material properties of the tissue can be altered via control.
