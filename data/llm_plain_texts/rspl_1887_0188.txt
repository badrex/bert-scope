tldr: The author discusses the properties of simultaneous invariants and eductive operators in binary forms. They explore the connections between the theory of binary forms and functional invariants, and provide examples of eductive operators and their applications. The study of these concepts helps in understanding the characteristics of simultaneous concomitants of binary quantics.
