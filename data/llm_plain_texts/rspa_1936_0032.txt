tldr: The authors present a formula for calculating the force between two coaxial helices carrying current in any relative position. This formula takes into account the spiral nature of the helices and improves upon previous methods that assumed an axially symmetrical magnetic field. The formula is essential for accurate measurements of electric currents using a balance with helix-shaped coils.
