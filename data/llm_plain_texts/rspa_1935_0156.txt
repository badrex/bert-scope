tldr: This article discusses the measurements of wireless wave absorption in the ionosphere, focusing on the reflection coefficient and the absorption in different regions. The authors used a pulse transmitter and a circularly polarized receiver to measure the reflection coefficient of one magneto-ionic component. They found that most of the absorption occurred in the "D-region" of the ionosphere, and that absorption near the top of the trajectory, called "absorption in the reflecting region," was also significant. The results provide valuable information about the ionization density and the frequency of collisions between electrons and molecules at different heights in the ionosphere.
