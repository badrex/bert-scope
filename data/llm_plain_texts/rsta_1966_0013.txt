tldr: The authors study the marine sediments and bottom communities of the Seychelles Bank in the northwest Indian Ocean. They describe three main sediment groups and their associated bottom communities, as well as the submarine platforms and reef environments found in the area. The study provides insights into the relationship between sedimentary facies and the distribution of bottom communities, as well as the influence of geological and environmental factors on the region's marine ecosystems.
