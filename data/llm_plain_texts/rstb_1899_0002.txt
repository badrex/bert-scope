tldr: The author investigates the formation, storage, and depletion of carbohydrates, specifically starch, in the foliage leaves of monocotyledons. They examine various monocotyledon species and find that starch formation is generally rare in these plants. The author also discusses the relationship between the presence or absence of starch and the characteristics of the plant, as well as the factors that may influence starch production, such as the age of the leaf and the plant's exposure to sunlight.
