tldr: This article explores one-dimensional acoustic wave propagation in a plasma fluid near the field of an electrical disturbance. It presents methods for solving the wave problem with an electrical source, taking a Laplace transform in time and using either a Fourier transform or difference equations in space. The study examines wave stability and provides insights into the excitation of ion acoustic waves by electric fields.
