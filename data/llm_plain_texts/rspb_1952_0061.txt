tldr: The authors conducted a study on the fine structure of cell walls in around sixty species of filamentous green algae using X-ray analysis, polarizing microscopes, and staining reactions. They discovered that the algae can be divided into three groups based on their wall structures and compositions. The study aimed to understand the relationship between growth form and structure, as well as the relationships among the algae for taxonomic purposes.
