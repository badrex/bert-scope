tldr: 'This article presents observations of tides in Refuge Cove, Wellington Channel, in the Arctic Seas. The author, Rev. Samuel Haughton, analyzes the Lunar Diurnal Tide and Lunitidal Intervals during the time of Equinox. The study provides useful information on the tidal patterns and helps determine the time of the Atlantic Tide-wave passing from Refuge Cove to Northumberland Sound. The findings contribute to a better understanding of tides in the Arctic region.'
