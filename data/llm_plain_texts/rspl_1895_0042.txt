tldr: This study investigates the occlusion of oxygen and hydrogen by platinum black and its effects on gas absorption. The authors found that platinum black can absorb about 310 volumes of hydrogen per unit volume, with 200 volumes converted into water. The remaining hydrogen can be removed at various temperatures in vacuo. The authors also observed that the absorption of hydrogen is influenced by impurities and that platinum black behaves differently when heated in oxygen and hydrogen atmospheres.
