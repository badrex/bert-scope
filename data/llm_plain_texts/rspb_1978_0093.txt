tldr: The author presents a new approach to studying the dynamics of neutral mutations and genetic drift in large populations. This approach is particularly useful for analyzing loci with multiple alleles and provides a dynamical picture for the neutral infinite-alleles model. The text also surveys the theory of diffusion approximations and discusses the current understanding of existence, uniqueness, and approximation in these models.
