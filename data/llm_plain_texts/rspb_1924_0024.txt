tldr: 'The authors studied the electric response of reflex contractions in spinal and decerebrate preparations. They found that the electric response in spinal preparations mainly consists of regular action currents, while in decerebrate preparations, secondary waves are more prominent. The results provide insights into the functioning of the reflex arc and the central nervous system's role in controlling muscle contractions.'
