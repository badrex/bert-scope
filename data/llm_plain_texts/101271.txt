tldr: The author, Monsieur Justel, conducted experiments to understand why certain papers were not visible to the eye. They discovered that the loss of vision occurred where the optic nerve met the blood vessels in the retina. This led them to question whether vision was created in the retina or the choroides, a membrane at the back of the eye. The author suggests that further research is needed to confirm their findings and explore the role of the choroides in vision.
