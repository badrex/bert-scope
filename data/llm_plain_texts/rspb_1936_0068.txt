tldr: The author investigates the external mechanics of chromosomes and proposes the balance theory of mitosis. They study the forces acting on chromosomes during cell division, including centromere and centrosome interactions. The balance theory explains how centrosomes and centromeres work together to create equilibrium during mitosis and meiosis, resolving previous contradictions in chromosome movement.
