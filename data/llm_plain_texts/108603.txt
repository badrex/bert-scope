tldr: The author investigates the deflection of the plumb-line at Arthur's Seat and finds that it is deflected by 5'25. They analyze the cause of the deflection, which is due to the unequal distribution of matter in the surrounding area. The author also discusses the geological structure of Arthur's Seat and the specific gravity of the rocks, as well as the importance of understanding the Earth's figure and dimensions for accurate measurements.
