tldr: This article investigates the effects of stress on the thermoelectric quality of metals, specifically iron, through various experiments. The author discovered that applying stress to iron wires resulted in a negative thermoelectric effect, which reached a maximum before decreasing and sometimes turning positive before the wire broke. The study also revealed a cyclic phenomenon in which the thermoelectric effect changed depending on the loading and unloading of stress, with the curves forming a wide area. The findings have implications for understanding the relationship between stress and thermoelectric properties in metals.
