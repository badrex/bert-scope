tldr: The authors studied the swelling and solubility of cellulose acetate in benzene/xylenol mixtures to understand the factors responsible for syneresis in gels. They found that the commercial cellulose acetate contains three major fractions with different acetyl contents, which affect its solubility and swelling behavior. The phase behavior of these fractions was analyzed, and a ternary phase diagram was constructed to understand the equilibrium between the swollen and liquid phases.
