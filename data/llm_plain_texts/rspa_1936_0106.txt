tldr: The authors conducted experiments using X-ray spectroscopy to study the L spectra of iron, cobalt, nickel, and copper. They found that the L energy levels are not dependent on the magnetic state of the metals, and the Moseley diagrams of the M levels show a change in slope for elements with atomic numbers 24 to 35. The study also revealed that the L levels and positions of the M levels are not dependent on the magnetic state of the elements.
