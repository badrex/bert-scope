tldr: The authors conducted a comprehensive review of the literature and experiments on the silver nitrate reaction in animal and vegetable tissues. They found that the reaction is not well understood and that there is much uncertainty about the nature of the reaction. The authors discuss various theories and propose that further research is needed to clarify the reaction's mechanism and its implications for understanding tissue structure and cell biology.
