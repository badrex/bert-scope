tldr: In a letter to James West, Esq, George Edwards, F.R.S., describes a new bird species from the East Indies. The bird has a unique appearance and behavior, with a blueish-ash color, a black belly, and a beautiful crest of long painted feathers. It is believed to prey on small reptiles like snakes and lizards. Edwards also mentions another bird, possibly the male of this species, which died shortly after arrival.
