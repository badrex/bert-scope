tldr: The author, John Ellis, conducted experiments on the growth and reproduction of animalcula in vegetable infusions, specifically focusing on the Mucor fungi. He discovered that these organisms reproduce by dividing across into two equal parts and that they are not animated. He also found that hemp seeds, when put into water, produce an indissoluble salt and generate millions of minute animalcula.
