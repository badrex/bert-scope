tldr: The author conducted experiments on the electric decomposition of carbonic acid gas, discovering that it can generate oxygen and carbonic oxide. The author also found that the generated oxygen can be used to create ozone, which has potential applications in isolating and studying this unique gas. The findings contribute to the understanding of the interaction between electricity and gases, and the potential for using electric currents to manipulate chemical reactions.
