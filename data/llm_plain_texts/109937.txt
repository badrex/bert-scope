tldr: This article discusses the optical and physical properties of tabasheer, a substance found in bamboo. It explores its transparency, refractive power, and absorbent properties. Tabasheer has a lower refractive power than any other solid or liquid, and the author conducts experiments to understand its unique behavior when absorbing different liquids and the resulting changes in its optical properties.
