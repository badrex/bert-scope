tldr: The article discusses the discovery of the MIC2 gene, a human pseudoautosomal gene involved in sex determination. The authors describe the molecular cloning of the gene and its use in studying the genetics of the Y chromosome. They also discuss the role of the MIC2 gene in the pseudoautosomal region and its relation to X-inactivation and sex determination in humans.
