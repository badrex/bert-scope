  - Electrical Signals
  - Muscle Contraction
  - Muscle Function
tldr: The author investigates the relationship between motion in animals and plants and the electrical phenomena associated with it. They focus on muscle function and the electrical changes that occur during muscle contraction. The author uses graphic methods and precise time measurements to study these processes and their connection to functional activity in living organisms.
