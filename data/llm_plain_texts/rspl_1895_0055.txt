tldr: The authors conducted experiments comparing the expansion of argon, helium, air, and hydrogen using gas thermometers. They found that helium and hydrogen expand more than argon and air, with helium having the highest coefficient of expansion. This research helped improve understanding of gas behavior and contributed to the study of thermodynamics.
