tldr: The authors studied the Raman spectra of nine aldehydes and mesitylene, analyzing vibrational frequencies and molecular structure. They observed interesting relationships between the spectra of benzene and its derivatives, as well as the effects of increasing substitution on Raman frequencies. The study provides insights into the molecular behavior of aldehydes and aromatic compounds.
