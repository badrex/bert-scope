tldr: The article discusses the development of intracavity infrared-microwave double-resonance spectroscopy, a method that uses lasers to detect microwave resonances in low-pressure gas samples. This technique offers high sensitivity and has been applied to observe weak forbidden rotational transitions and multiple-photon Lamb-dip spectroscopy. The method works by establishing a steady state of pumped molecular flow among vibrational-rotational states, which is then disturbed by the application of resonant microwave radiation, causing a variation in laser power. The high sensitivity of this method is attributed to the conversion of microwave signals to infrared signals, the creation of anomalous population distributions, and the nonlinearity of laser action.
