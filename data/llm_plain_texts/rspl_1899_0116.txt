tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate the electrical conductivity in gases when cathode rays passed through them. They found that gases become conductive due to the production of positive and negative ions throughout their volume. The study also showed that the ionization in a gas varies directly with the pressure, and the ionizations produced by cathode rays are about 300 times more than those produced by Rontgen rays. The results provide insights into the understanding of the conductivity produced by cathode rays and their effects on various gases.
