tldr: This article explores the molecular biology of cell locomotion, specifically the interactions between fibroblasts and their substratum. The authors found that both endogenous and exogenous fibronectins play a role in cell-substratum interactions, including adhesion, spreading, and the export of matrix materials. They also discovered that fibronectin-bearing structures can lead to the formation of adhesions, stable anchorage, or intercellular junctions, depending on other cellular control mechanisms. The findings provide insights into the mechanisms of fibroblast adhesion and their roles in cellular functions.
