tldr: This article presents a numerical and theoretical study of various nonlinear wave phenomena, focusing on the Korteweg-de Vries equation and its generalizations. The authors develop an efficient numerical method that combines a pseudospectral (Fourier transform) treatment of the spatial dependence with a leapfrog scheme in time. They apply this method to investigate solitary wave interactions, wave breaking, the resolution of initial steps and wells, and the development of nonlinear wave train instabilities.
