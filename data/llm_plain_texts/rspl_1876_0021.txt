tldr: The author examines the structure and classification of the Stylasterid corals, a group of stony corals that are hydroids and not anthozoans. They study the soft parts of the corals and provide a detailed analysis of their morphology, including the identification of six genera and seven species. The author also discusses the methods used for sectioning and examining the corals, as well as the need for a revision of the classification of the Stylasterid corals based on the new knowledge of their soft parts structure.
