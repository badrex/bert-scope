tldr: The authors study the strength properties of highly elastic materials, specifically vulcanized rubber, and how cracks grow under repeated stressing. They introduce the concept of a fatigue limit, below which the life of the material can be virtually indefinite. They also explain how to calculate the energy required to rupture the polymer chains across the path of a crack, which is related to the material's molecular structure. This research helps to understand the difference between various strength properties, such as tensile strength and tear strength, and how they relate to the material's viscoelastic behavior.
