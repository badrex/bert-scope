tldr: The authors describe the Jurassic ammonites found in Jebel Tuwaiq, central Arabia, and provide a stratigraphical introduction to the area. They divide the Jurassic system into formations, such as Marrat, Dhruma, Tuwaiq Mountain, Hanifa, Jubaila, and Riyadh, and discuss the lithology and fossil contents of each. The ammonites discovered are of great interest for their unique characteristics and their significance in understanding the region's paleogeography, correlation, phylogeny, and systematics.
