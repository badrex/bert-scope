tldr: This article investigates the effect of particle interaction on the coercive force of ferromagnetic micropowders. The authors extend previous theoretical work on single-domain ferromagnetic particles to account for the interaction between particles. They derive a general relation for the magnetic interaction energy of two prolate spheroidal particles and discuss the magnetic properties of various particle arrangements. The coercive force is found to depend on the interaction, with the change being proportional to the packing factor and the saturation magnetization. This research is applicable to assemblies of near-spherical particles in weak interaction.
