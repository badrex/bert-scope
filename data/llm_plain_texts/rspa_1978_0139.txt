tldr: The article examines the effects of healing and relaxation in helium II due to heat transfer at a wall. The authors model the helium as a two-fluid continuum and incorporate relaxation and healing terms into the governing equations. They find that the superfluid velocity behaves like a power law, and the healing parameter can be scaled out of the equations. The results reduce to those obtained by Clark (1963) when healing and relaxation are ignored.
