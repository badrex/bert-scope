tldr: This article describes experiments conducted on the compression of liquids at high pressures, reaching up to 40 tons per square inch or over 6000 atmospheres. The authors measured the compressibility of water, heavy cylinder oil, and powdered graphite, and discussed the effects of internal molecular forces on the liquids' behavior. They also investigated the role of temperature variations during compression and expansion.
