tldr: The authors studied the photolysis of nitrogen dioxide and nitric acid under isothermal conditions and observed the production of the nitrate radical (NO3). They measured the concentration of the radical and the rate constant for the reaction, finding agreement with previous kinetic measurements. The study provides insights into the mechanisms of these reactions and the role of the nitrate radical in atmospheric chemistry.
