tldr: The authors present a simplified and elegant theory for the finite deformation of incompressible isotropic elastic bodies using tensor notation and a general system of moving coordinates. They derive equations for stress and strain, and solve problems involving a rotating cylinder and a uniform spherical shell under internal and external pressures, using a completely general form for the strain-energy function.
