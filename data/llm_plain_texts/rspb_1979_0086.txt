tldr: The authors criticize the adaptationist programme in evolutionary biology, which focuses on natural selection as an omnipotent force shaping organisms. They argue that this approach ignores constraints, such as phyletic heritage and developmental pathways, and reduces organisms to isolated traits. The authors propose a more holistic view of organisms, considering them as integrated entities with constraints that shape their evolution.
