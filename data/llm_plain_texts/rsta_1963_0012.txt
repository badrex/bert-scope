tldr: The article discusses Cerenkov radiation in a magneto-ionic medium and its application to the generation of low-frequency electromagnetic radiation in the exosphere by the passage of charged corpuscular streams. The authors evaluate the electromagnetic field produced by a uniformly moving point charge in a collisionless magneto-ionic medium and show that Cerenkov radiation in the exosphere produces low-frequency hiss. They also compute the spectral and angular distributions of radiation over the low-frequency band for specific values of plasma and gyro frequencies at various distances from the earth's center.
