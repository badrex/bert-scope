tldr: This article discusses the various ways hormones can control protein synthesis in cells. It explores different mechanisms, such as altering mRNA synthesis, ribosome activity, and degradation of mRNA. The author also presents alternative hypotheses for how hormones may affect protein synthesis, including the role of ribosome subunits and the possibility of hormonal control over mRNA transport and degradation.
