tldr: The author investigates the role of the hippocampus in memory and its impact on habit formation and voluntary movement in monkeys. They use various memory-dependent performance rules to assess the monkeys' memory and find that hippocampal lesions impair memory for voluntary movements while leaving memory for other environmental events intact. This study has implications for understanding the relationship between memory processes and behavior.
