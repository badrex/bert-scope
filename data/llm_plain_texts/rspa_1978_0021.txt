tldr: The author investigates the gravitational perturbations of the Kerr black hole using the Newman-Penrose formalism. They complete the integration of the linearized equations and determine the perturbations in the metric coefficients. The study provides insights into the behavior of black holes under perturbations and helps in understanding their properties and potential applications.
