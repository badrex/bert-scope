tldr: This article examines the negative variation in nerves of warm-blooded animals and how it is affected by factors such as temperature, nerve type, and the presence of anaesthetics. The author finds that the negative variation persists for several hours post-mortem and that different nerves in the same animal may have varying responses. The article also discusses the effects of anaesthetics like chloroform, ether, and carbon dioxide on the nerves of warm-blooded animals, showing that they cause a decrease in the negative variation, followed by recovery in some cases.
