tldr: The authors developed a method to stabilize a pure acetylene decomposition flame on a burner, allowing them to study the flame's kinetics and reaction mechanism. They determined the burning velocity of acetylene and hydrocarbon-air mixtures, deducing effective activation energies and orders from the pressure and temperature dependence of burning velocity. The proposed reaction mechanism, which is likely dominant in flames and in the absence of soot deposits, accounts for the differences in activation energies and orders compared to low-temperature pyrolysis and shock-tube studies.
