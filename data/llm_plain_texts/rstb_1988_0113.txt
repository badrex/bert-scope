tldr: This article discusses the control mechanisms of testicular differentiation in mouse and man. The authors propose that in the absence of testis-determining genes (tdg), the indifferent gonad is programmed to become an ovary. They also highlight the importance of understanding the chronology of testicular differentiation and the role of regulatory genes in this process. The article provides insights into the initial stages of gonadal development and the differences between testicular and ovarian development.
