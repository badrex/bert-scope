tldr: This article discusses the development of iron(II)-1,2,4-triazole spin transition molecular materials, which exhibit abrupt spin transitions and large thermal hysteresis effects. The authors review their work on these materials, focusing on trinuclear and polymeric species, and introduce the concept of spin transition molecular alloys. The potential use of these materials in memory devices is also explored.
