tldr: This study investigates the electric fields and cloud polarities of South African thunderstorms. The research found an overwhelming preponderance of clouds with positive polarity, which supports the theory that these storms play a significant role in maintaining the Earth's surface charge. The findings contribute to the understanding of electro-meteorological phenomena and the overall study of thunderstorms.
