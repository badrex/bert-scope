tldr: The authors used isotopic tracer techniques to study the mechanism of ketone production during the gaseous oxidation of isobutane. They found that the formation of methyl ethyl ketone involves predominantly the rearrangement and decomposition of the tert-butyl peroxy radical. This research helps to understand the chemical changes occurring during the oxidation process.
