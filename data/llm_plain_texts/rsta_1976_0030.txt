tldr: This paper reviews theoretical models for the solar corona's energy and pressure balance, discussing processes such as heating by mechanical waves, convective out-flow, thermal conduction, and radiated power loss. The authors suggest possible observations to help answer outstanding questions about the energy balance in the solar atmosphere.
