tldr: The author investigates the electrical response of the frog's eyeball to various stimuli, including light and induction shocks. They discover that the normal electrical response is positive and that the eyeball has properties similar to an electrical organ. The author also studies the effects of temperature and pressure on the eyeball's response and compares it to the responses of electrical organs as described by du Bois Reymond.
