tldr: The authors investigate the population dynamic consequences of density-dependent selection in stage-structured population models using invasibility analyses. They focus on the trade-off between the sensitivities of juvenile survival and maturation rates to population density, showing that selection tends to minimize the sensitivity of juvenile survival at the expense of a lower maturation rate, leading to more stable populations.
