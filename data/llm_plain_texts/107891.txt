tldr: The author conducted an anatomical study of the Zariffa's stomach and compared it to other ruminant animals. They discovered that the Zariffa's second stomach cavity has less deep cells than other ruminants, as the cud from acacia leaves and twigs is already succulent and does not need to be re-moistened. This adaptation allows the Zariffa to better subsist on its natural diet.
