tldr: 'The article discusses two dating methods, archaeomagnetic and thermoluminescent, for determining the age of archaeological materials. Archaeomagnetic dating measures the ancient direction of the Earth's magnetic field recorded in baked clay, while thermoluminescence measures the age of pottery independently of existing chronologies. These methods can help refine existing chronological frameworks and provide valuable information for archaeologists and geophysicists.'
