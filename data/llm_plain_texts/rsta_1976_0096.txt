tldr: This study investigates the development and morphology of an abandoned cliff in London Clay at Hadleigh, Essex. The cliff was formed by fluvial erosion during the Middle and Late Devensian periods. The cliff has degraded in an episodic manner, with four main stages of degradation identified and dated. The research examines the processes and mechanics that led to the cliff's current morphology and condition, providing insights into the geological history of the area.
