tldr: The authors describe a new technique for hypophysectomy in birds, which involves removing the pituitary gland through a transbuccal route. They successfully performed this operation on various bird species and observed significant changes in reproductive systems and secondary sexual characteristics. The procedure opens up new avenues for studying sex hormones in birds.
