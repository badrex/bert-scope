tldr: This article presents a study on the geometrically similar expansion of a hole in a thin infinite plate. The authors use the Prandtl-Reuss relations for large deformation elastic-plastic flow of a work-hardening material to derive a complete solution. The findings can be used to test solutions obtained by finite element methods for large deformation plastic analysis.
