tldr: The authors studied the magnetic anisotropy and electronic structure of binuclear copper (II) acetate monohydrate, a compound significant in metal-metal interaction research. They found that the magnetic anisotropy is sensitive to the anisotropy in the high-frequency term of susceptibility expressions, enabling them to assign the disputed ligand field transitions. The study also discussed the nature of chemical bonding and exchange interactions in the compound.
