tldr: This article presents a first-principles mean-field theory for understanding the electronic structure and compositional order of random metallic alloys. The authors use the self-consistent KKR-CPA method to analyze the behavior of metallic alloys, considering factors such as size, electronegativity, and electron-to-atom ratio. The theory provides a foundation for understanding the order-disorder transformations in metallic alloys and can be applied to other random systems like liquids and glasses.
