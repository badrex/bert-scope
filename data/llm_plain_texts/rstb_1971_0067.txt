tldr: The authors used immunofluorescence histochemistry to study the distribution of neurophysin-n in the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system of the pig. They found that the hormone-binding protein occurs throughout the system and is mainly localized in the neurosecretory neurons arising from the supraoptic nucleus. This research helps to understand the roles of the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei in the production of vasopressin and oxytocin.
