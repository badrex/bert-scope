tldr: The authors present a new method for measuring the power given by any electric current to any circuit using an ordinary alternating-current voltmeter. This method is independent of assumptions about the nature of the current or the circuit and can be applied to measure power in alternating-current arcs and arc-lamps. The method is based on the difference of phase between the potential difference and the current.
