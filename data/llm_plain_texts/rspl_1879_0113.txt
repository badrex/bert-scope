tldr: The authors successfully isolated urobilin, a pigment found in human urine, and studied its chemical and spectroscopic properties. They discovered that urobilin is present in the bile of various animals and can exist in different states of oxidation. The pigment has significant implications for understanding the chemistry of bile and urine.
