tldr: The article presents a two-dimensional zonally averaged model for simulating the climate of the Northern Hemisphere. The model incorporates atmospheric, upper-ocean, and ice-sheet components to study the seasonal cycle of the climate and its response to long-term insolation anomalies caused by orbital perturbations. The model's results show a reasonable agreement with climatological data and provide insights into the Earth's climate and its variations.
