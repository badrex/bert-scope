tldr: The author explores the coordinates of vertices in regular honeycombs in hyperbolic space, specifically focusing on honeycombs with Schlafli symbols {4,4,3}, {6,3,3}, {6,3,4}, {4,3,4,3}, and {3,4,3,3,3}. They use quadratic Diophantine equations to find the coordinates for these honeycombs and explain the differences between Euclidean and hyperbolic honeycombs. The author also discusses the symmetry groups and transformations involved in these honeycombs.
