tldr: This study investigates the phosphatase activity of Bacterium lactis aerogenes and how it is affected by various environmental factors such as pH, amino acid additions, and different energy sources. The phosphatase activity declines over time, and the pattern of variation depends on the medium composition. Maintaining a constant pH or diluting the medium does not prevent the decline.
