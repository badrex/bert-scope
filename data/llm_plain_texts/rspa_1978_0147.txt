tldr: The authors study the magnetohydrodynamic flow in a container with a hemi-spheroidal shape due to the discharge of an electric current from a finite-sized electrode. They analyze the effects of the electrode's size on the flow field's intensity and find that the size of the electrode has a significant impact on the velocity field. The research provides insights into the structure of the flow field in welding processes and helps improve our understanding of electromagnetic stirring in arc-welding.
