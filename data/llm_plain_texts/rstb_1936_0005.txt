tldr: The author examines tooth replacement patterns in theriodont reptiles, specifically in Thrinaxodon liorhinus, and concludes that the replacement is not of the mammalian type. Instead, alternate teeth are replaced at one stage and the others later, suggesting this condition is an inheritance from the earliest tetrapods.
