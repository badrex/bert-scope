tldr: This article describes the observations of the solar eclipse on July 12, 1684, made by various astronomers at different locations. They used instruments like the parallactic engine and micrometers to measure the eclipse's phases, the Sun's and Moon's diameters, and the distances between the Sun's horns. The observations helped determine the Moon's parallax and the apparent diameter, while also noting the absence of pain during the eclipse for those who could see Venus.
