tldr: The authors present a model of neuronal polarization and axon formation based on the existence of a determinant chemical that influences neurite growth rates. The model predicts a winner-take-all instability, leading to rapid growth of one neurite (the axon) and diminished growth of others. This behavior aligns with axotomy experiments and growth-modulating substance applications. The study contributes to understanding the physical mechanisms behind neuronal polarization and development.
