revised_title: 'The Role and Significance of Pyrazines in Nature'

  - Pheromones

  - Mullerian mimicry
  - Pyrazine chemistry

tldr: 'The authors discuss the widespread distribution of pyrazines in various species, including plants, insects, vertebrates, and marine organisms. They speculate that pyrazines may serve as natural points of convergence in the evolution of alerting signals used for different but related intraspecific purposes. Pyrazines may also act as ectohormones that interact with predator physiology. Their odour can potentiate taste aversion learning and associative learning of immune suppression in animals.'
