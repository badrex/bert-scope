tldr: The author investigates the structure and distribution of fibres in animal and plant tissues using microscopy. They discover that fibres, also known as flat filaments, have a similar structure in various tissues and are formed within blood corpuscles. Fibres can be found in different parts of the body, including muscles, nerves, and blood vessels, and are present in both animals and plants.
