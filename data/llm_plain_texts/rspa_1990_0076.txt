tldr: The authors used a unique numerical approach to study the internal structure and dynamics of bubble-type vortex breakdown. They found that the boundaries of the vortex breakdown bubble appear symmetric, but the internal flow field is not. This study provides insights into the mechanisms of mixing and entrainment required to sustain the bubble region and helps to understand the fluid physics involved in vortex breakdown.
