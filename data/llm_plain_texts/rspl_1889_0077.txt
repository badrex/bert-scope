tldr: The article discusses the presence and distribution of outlying nerve-cells in the mammalian spinal cord. These cells are found in the white matter of the cord, in the anterior, lateral, and posterior columns. The author suggests that these cells may be connected to nerve-fibers and provide insights into the anatomy of the spinal cord and the groups of cells they belong to. The presence of these cells may also support theories about the connection between certain cells and medullated fibers in the spinal cord.
