tldr: The article investigates the probability of detecting first, second, and later quanta secreted at motor-nerve terminals during the early release period following a nerve impulse. The fusion-pore model, which describes the secretion of a quantum at a release site, is developed and tested. The study also explores the possibility of autoinhibition affecting later quantal release during this period. The findings provide support for the fusion-pore model and suggest that appropriate detection procedures must be adopted for adequate quantal secretion analysis.
