tldr: The authors develop the operational wave equation and use it to find the energy levels of hydrogen-like atoms. They identify four reducible operators, which are linear in the p's, and use them to determine the energy levels. The results are connected by the well-known relation, which involves the fine structure constant and the quantum numbers of the atom.
