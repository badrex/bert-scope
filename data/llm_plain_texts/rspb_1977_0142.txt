tldr: The study investigates the ultrastructure of choroid plexus epithelial cells in early foetal sheep to understand the possible role of endoplasmic reticulum in the transport of proteins and non-electrolytes from blood to cerebrospinal fluid. The research finds an extensive transcellular system of endoplasmic reticulum in immature foetal sheep choroid plexus, suggesting its importance in transepithelial penetration of proteins and non-electrolytes. The study also shows a difference in the appearance of the tubulo-cisternal system between early and late gestation stages.
