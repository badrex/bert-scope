tldr: The study investigates the sorption of propyl, iso-propyl, and butyl alcohols by silica gel at 25°C. The isothermals of all five alcohols show similar characteristics, with a linear portion representing a condensation process. A small hysteresis area occurs just before saturation, and the capillary radius calculated using the Kelvin equation remains constant at about 15 Å.
