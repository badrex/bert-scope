tldr: The authors investigated the individuality of red blood corpuscles in higher animals, focusing on the red blood cells of cattle and fowls. They discovered that each individual's red blood cells possess unique characteristics that differentiate them from those of other individuals, even of the same species. This individuality was demonstrated through the formation of antibodies and iso-agglutination in fowls when injected with blood from other fowls. The findings suggest that this individuality may be a general law applicable to body cells in higher animals.
