tldr: The authors compare the mechanisms of upstream influence in subsonic and supersonic flows through boundary layers. They discuss two separate mechanisms for upstream influence in supersonic flow and explain how they also operate in subsonic flow. A quantitative theory of subsonic flow up a step is provided to illustrate these differences. The main differences between subsonic and supersonic flows are the boundaries of dead-air regions, separation, and the distance of upstream influence.
