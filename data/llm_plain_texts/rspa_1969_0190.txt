tldr: This study investigates the kinetic stability of a strut with a tangential force applied at one end. An experimental method is described to generate the tangential load using a water jet from a nozzle attached to the column's end. Theoretical treatment is presented, and the results show close agreement between predicted and observed values of critical load and oscillation frequency.
