tldr: 'This article examines the effects of capsaicin on nociceptive afferents from the skin. The authors found that capsaicin blocks conduction in over 90% of C-fibres and about 25% of A-fibres when applied directly to the saphenous nerve. They also discovered that approximately 70% of polymodal nociceptor terminals in the skin become inexcitable after capsaicin application. The long-term effects of capsaicin on nerve conduction and nociceptor function in non-rodent mammals remain to be established.'
