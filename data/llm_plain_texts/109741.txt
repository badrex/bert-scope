tldr: The author, William Hyde Wollaston, conducted a crystallographic study of carbonate of lime, bitter-spar, and iron-spar. He found that the primitive rhomboid angles of these minerals differ from each other and from the previously assigned angles. This discovery led him to infer that the crystalline form of these minerals does not depend on the presence of lime or other ingredients but is determined by the carbonate of lime alone.
