tldr: The author presents tables of meteorological instrument movements in Toronto, focusing on the daily fall of the barometer. He suggests that the cause of the fall is due to the expansion of vapor produced by solar heat at the surface, which is then condensed in the upper regions of the air, reducing atmospheric pressure.
