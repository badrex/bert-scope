tldr: The authors investigate the oscillation dynamics of droplets during mass transfer processes. They derive equations of motion for oscillating spherical droplets and experimentally validate their theoretical predictions. The study provides insights into the energy dissipation during oscillations and supports the "kicking" mechanism proposed in a previous part. This research contributes to understanding interfacial phenomena and mass transfer in complex systems.
