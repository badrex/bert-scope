tldr: The authors studied the primary products and processes in the radiolysis of 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (MTHF) using various spectroscopic techniques. They found that the primary products of radiolysis are electrons and positive ions, which undergo rapid ion-molecule reactions to form radicals. The electrons can be trapped in the glassy MTHF matrix or captured by additives like naphthalene, ferric chloride, carbon tetrachloride, nitrous oxide, or trans-stilbene. The study provides insights into the nature and kinetics of reactions involving electrons and positive ions in radiolysis.
