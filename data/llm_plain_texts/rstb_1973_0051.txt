tldr: This study examines the depositional and erosional history of Aldabra Atoll, a coral island in the Indian Ocean. The research reveals a complex history of sedimentation, coral growth, and environmental changes over late-Pleistocene times. The findings show that Aldabra's geological history has had a significant impact on the island's marine and terrestrial biotas, with the atoll's evolving morphological and sedimentological framework being crucial to understanding the character of its present-day fauna and flora.
