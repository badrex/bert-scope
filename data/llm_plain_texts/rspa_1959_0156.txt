tldr: The authors present a mathematical solution for exchange processes in fixed columns, such as ion exchange, heat exchange, and adsorption. They solve the kinetic-theory equations for general entry conditions and provide asymptotic expressions for small values of the ratio of the exchange coefficient to the rate of volume flux of the fluid. The results are applicable to various exchange processes and can be used to improve understanding and optimization of these processes in industries.
