tldr: The authors studied the effective thermal conductivity of dilute suspensions containing highly conducting slender inclusions aligned in one direction. They extended the analysis of Rocha and Acrivos and used slender body theory to calculate the conductivity of a suspension with randomly distributed particles. The findings show the importance of particle distribution in determining the effective transport coefficient of composite materials when particle-particle interactions are significant.
