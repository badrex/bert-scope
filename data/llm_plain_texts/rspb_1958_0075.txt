tldr: The authors discuss the role of the pentose phosphate pathway in mammary tissue, focusing on glucose utilization and its importance during lactation. They found that the activity of the pentose phosphate pathway enzymes is extremely high in the rat mammary gland at the height of lactation, suggesting that this pathway plays a significant role in milk secretion. The study also highlights the impact of insulin on lipogenesis in lactating rat mammary tissue.
