tldr: The authors studied the crossed extensor reflex in both spinal and decerebrate preparations, observing similarities and differences in their characteristics. They found that the spinal preparation can develop the slow cumulative progress of the tetanic contraction of the reflex, and that recruitment is a distinctive feature of certain reflex groups. The study contributes to the understanding of reflexes and their mechanisms in the nervous system.
