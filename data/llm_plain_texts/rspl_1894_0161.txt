tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the electrification of air and gases by bubbling them through water and other liquids. They discovered that when air is bubbled through water, the water becomes positively electrified, and the enclosed air mass becomes negatively electrified. The findings suggest that the presence of dust in the air affects the rate of electrification.
