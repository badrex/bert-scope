tldr: The author investigates the crystallographic properties of monoclinic double selenates in the iron group, confirming the general law of progression with atomic weight and atomic number. The study reveals that the iron group's crystallographic properties are directly proportional to the change in atomic weight or number, with the rubidium salt having intermediate properties between potassium and caesium salts. The ammonium salt is found to be isomorphous but not eutropic with the alkali metallic salts.
