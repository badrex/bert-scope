tldr: 'This article presents a series of observations on atmospheric radioactivity and its relationship with Indian weather. The author found that the radioactivity in Lucknow is higher than in Europe, and that it is influenced by factors such as barometric pressure, wind direction, and cloud types. The results support the theory of atmospheric radioactivity proposed by Elster and Geitel.'
