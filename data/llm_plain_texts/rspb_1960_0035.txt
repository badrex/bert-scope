tldr: The authors investigated the metabolism of 3-indolylalkanecarboxylic acids and their amides, nitriles, and methyl esters in plant tissues. They found that the breakdown of these compounds occurs through different mechanisms, such as α-oxidation and β-oxidation, and that the activity of these compounds can be explained by their conversion to corresponding acids. The results provide further evidence for the role of plant hormones in regulating plant growth.
