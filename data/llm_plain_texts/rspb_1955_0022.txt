tldr: The authors studied the hardening process of the cockroach cuticle, specifically the role of phenolic tanning. They discovered that the cuticle hardens through a two-step process involving impregnation with sterol and protein, followed by the action of a phenolic tanning agent derived from the blood. This process causes the cuticle to change color and become resistant to staining, providing protection for the insect.
