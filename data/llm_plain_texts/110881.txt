tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the amount of inorganic matter removed from the soil by wheat seeds. They found that the average amount of inorganic matter in wheat is 10% and concluded that one pound of inorganic matter is removed per acre in a wheat crop. The author also recommended drying wheat at low temperatures to ensure consistent results and found that using nitric acid to speed up combustion was unreliable.
