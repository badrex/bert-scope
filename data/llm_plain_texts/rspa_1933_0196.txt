tldr: The authors conducted a Fourier analysis of the durene structure to determine its molecular orientation and electron distribution. They found that the carbon atoms in the benzene ring have a higher electron density than the methyl groups, and the molecules are positioned in the crystal to maintain a constant minimum distance between adjacent methyl groups. The analysis also revealed that the durene structure is more distended around the methyl groups, which is expected due to the presence of three hydrogen atoms at these points.
