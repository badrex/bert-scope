tldr: The authors conducted a detailed study of the products formed from the reaction between hydrogen atoms and ethylene in a discharge-flow system. They found that the main products were methane and ethane, with smaller amounts of propane and butane. A proposed mechanism for the formation of these products is presented, and rate constants for the elementary steps are derived using computer calculations.
