tldr: 'The author, Peter Barlow, describes his experiments on constructing an achromatic telescope using a fluid concave lens instead of the usual flint glass lens. He successfully created two fluid telescopes with apertures of 3 and 6 inches. Barlow used the sulphuret of carbon as the fluid lens, which has a refractive index similar to flint glass and a higher dispersive power. This new design allows for shorter telescope tubes while maintaining or even improving focal power. Barlow also discusses the potential for reducing the secondary spectrum in future experiments.'
