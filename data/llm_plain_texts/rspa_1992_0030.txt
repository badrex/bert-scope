tldr: The authors analyze the over-end unwinding of yarn from a stationary helically wound cylindrical package, focusing on the motion of the yarn between the unwind point and the guide eye. They develop a theoretical framework to study the yarn dynamics and provide a complete analysis of the yarn's motion through a complete unwinding cycle.
