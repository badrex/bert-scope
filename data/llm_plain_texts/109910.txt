tldr: The author, Thomas Greatorex, used a 28-foot staff and barometers to measure the height of Skiddaw Mountain in the North of England. He also recorded changes in atmospheric pressure at different altitudes during the descent. This method allowed for accurate measurement of the mountain's height and provided valuable data on the relationship between altitude and atmospheric pressure.
