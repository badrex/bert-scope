tldr: 'The article discusses the recent development of reefs in the Northern Province of the Great Barrier Reef. It explains how reefs grow in two distinct environments, at the shelf edge and in the shelter of the barrier. The study focuses on inner-shelf reefs and their growth patterns, including the influence of wind and waves on their development. The article also explores the geological history of the reefs and the role of sea level changes in their formation.'
