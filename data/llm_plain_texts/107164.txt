tldr: The author conducted experiments on five cakes of wootz steel, analyzing their differences in appearance and properties. They discovered that the quality of wootz steel varies greatly, with some cakes being more suitable for forging than others. The author also found that wootz steel contains unmetallized iron ore, which may be a key component in its production. This research provides valuable insights into the manufacturing process of wootz steel and its unique properties.
