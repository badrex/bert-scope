tldr: This study examines the unique ecosystem on Anak Krakatau, where a species of flightless cricket, Speonemobius sp., thrives on allochthonous aeolian debris. The cricket is nocturnal and feeds on a wide range of insects and other arthropods that fall from the sky. The study confirms the presence of an aeolian ecosystem on Anak Krakatau, with the cricket being the most abundant consumer present. The cricket's biology shows extraordinary parallels with another nemobiine, Caconemobius fori, in Hawaii, and it appears to be well adapted to exploit this seemingly adverse habitat.
