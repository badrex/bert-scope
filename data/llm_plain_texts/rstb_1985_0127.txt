tldr: This study investigates the effects of a shallow-sea tidal mixing front on heterotrophic activity in the western Irish Sea. Researchers measured the uptake of glucose in different water masses, finding that turnover rates were higher in stratified waters above the pycnocline. The results suggest that surface waters and the frontal zone play a significant role in carbon flux and potential bacterial biomass production.
