tldr: This article discusses the challenges and techniques involved in controlling aerosol pollution from industrial sources. It highlights the importance of reducing emissions of fine particles and the difficulties in removing them effectively due to their small size. The author explores various methods of dust arrestors, stack design, and siting to reduce emissions, and suggests that further research is needed to improve the efficiency of removing submicron particles.
