tldr: This study investigates the simultaneous effect of rotation and a magnetic field on the onset of buoyancy-driven thermal convection in a horizontal layer of viscous fluid with finite electrical conductivity, confined between two rigid, perfectly conducting or electrically non-conducting boundaries, and heated from below. The authors obtain critical constants for the onset of cellular convection by solving the differential eigenvalue system using both an initial value and a variational technique for an extensive range of Taylor and Chandrasekhar number values. The theoretical values are presented mainly in diagrammatical form and are compared with experimental results of Nakagawa at the corresponding parameter values.
