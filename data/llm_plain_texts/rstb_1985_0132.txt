tldr: The study investigates the olivary pretectal nucleus (OPN) in rats, a central component of the pupillary light reflex. The researchers conducted light and electron microscope experiments to analyze the cellular and synaptic organization of the OPN in albino and pigmented rats. They identified two main cell types, class I and class II, and described the complex synaptic relationships within the nucleus. The findings suggest that the OPN plays a crucial role in the pupillary light reflex pathway and has complex inputs from various sources, including the retina, superior colliculus, and ventral lateral geniculate nucleus.
