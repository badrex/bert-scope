tldr: The pyrolysis of 2,3-dimethylbutane was studied to understand the role of isopropyl radicals in the reaction mechanism. The authors found that the reaction proceeds via a Rice-Herzfeld chain scheme with self-inhibition due to hydrogen abstraction from the major olefin product, 2-methyl-2-butene. The mechanism and rate parameters were determined and agreed with previous measurements, thermochemical calculations, and experimental observations.
