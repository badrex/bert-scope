tldr: This article presents variational calculations of rovibrational energy levels and wavefunctions for the HCN molecule. The authors use a hamiltonian expressed in internal coordinates and a polynomial expansion in Morse coordinates for bond stretches and the interbond angle. They believe their calculation is converged to better than 1% at 18,000 cm^-1. The potential surface is expressed in terms of 31 parameters, with about half refined by least squares to optimize the fit to experimental data.
