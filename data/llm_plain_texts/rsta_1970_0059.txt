tldr: This article provides an in-depth discussion of molecular photoelectron spectroscopy, focusing on the helium 584 A photoelectron spectra of molecular vapours. It covers factors affecting the number of bands observed, their relation to the number of occupied electronic energy levels, and the effect of molecular translational velocity on the attainable line widths. The article also explores structural effects in lone pair ionization, vibrational fine structure analysis, and the use of the helium resonance light source in exciting photoelectron spectra.
