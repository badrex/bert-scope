tldr: The author, John Maud, discovered a unique phenomenon in chemistry where essential oil of sassafras, upon exposure to frost, transformed into transparent crystals. This transformation from a fluid to a solid body provides a new instance of crystallization and may offer insights into the nature of solidity and fluidity, as well as the dependence of color on the mechanical arrangement of a substance's components.
