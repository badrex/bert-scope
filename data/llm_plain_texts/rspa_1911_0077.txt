tldr: This study investigates the adherence of flat surfaces, particularly steel surfaces, and finds that at least 75% of the adhesion is caused by the presence of a liquid film between the surfaces in contact. The remaining 25% is due to atmospheric pressure. The research also shows that adhesion practically vanishes when no film is present.
