tldr: This article reviews melting experiments on important mantle and core materials, discussing possible sources of controversy with results from other laboratories. The author argues that static melting experiments on laser-heated iron in a diamond-anvil cell provide the highest accuracy in melting temperatures. The data suggest a new, unidentified phase for the inner core and an inner-core temperature of about 5000 K. The melting curves of major lower-mantle minerals, such as Mg-Si-perovskite and magnesiowüstite, are in sharp contrast to previous estimates.
