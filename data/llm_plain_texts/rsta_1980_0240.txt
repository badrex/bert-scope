tldr: This article studies the propagation, reflection, transmission, and stability of atmospheric Rossby-gravity waves on a beta-plane in the presence of latitudinally sheared zonal flows. The authors derive a local dispersion relation and use it to study the wave normal surfaces and ray trajectories. They also investigate the influence of critical latitudes on the intensity of the wave, as well as the reflection, transmission, and stability of atmospheric waves by a finite shear layer.
