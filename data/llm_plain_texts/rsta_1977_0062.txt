tldr: This article discusses the electronic absorption spectra of lunar minerals, focusing on the role of transition metals in lunar rock-forming silicates. The authors explain how measurements of absorption spectra can provide information on the oxidation states and coordination of transition metal ions, which helps in understanding the formation of the lunar crust and mapping the surface composition of the Moon using remote sensing techniques.
