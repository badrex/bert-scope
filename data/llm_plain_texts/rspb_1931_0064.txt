tldr: The author discusses the messages transmitted by nerve fibers and the methods used to study them. They describe the improvement in nerve physiology techniques, such as the use of the triode valve amplifier, which allows for the recording of even the smallest changes in nerve fibers. The author also explains the nature of the messages transmitted by nerve fibers, which are made up of impulses that have fixed size and duration. They conclude that the transmission of messages through nerve impulses is the main form of nervous activity, although other forms may exist but are difficult to prove.
