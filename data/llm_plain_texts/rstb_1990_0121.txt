tldr: This study examines the response of the mature rat's cerebral hemisphere to injury using stereotactically placed knife wounds and various microscopy techniques. The research explores the cellular events, including the role of mesodermal and glial cells in scarring, the formation of the glia limitans, and the reaction of axons and dendrites to amputation. The findings provide insights into the recovery process after brain injury.
