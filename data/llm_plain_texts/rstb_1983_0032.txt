tldr: This article is an erratum for a previous publication about Emeraldella and Leanchoilia, two arthropods from the Burgess Shale in Middle Cambrian, British Columbia. Due to incorrect folding in the original publication, the descriptions of plates 2-10 and their corresponding explanatory drawings were misplaced. The error has been corrected in offprints and bound volumes, and subscribers with separate issues should notify their binders.
