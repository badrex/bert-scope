tldr: This study examines the physical constraints on magma contamination in the continental crust, focusing on the Adamello complex. The authors explore three main processes of magma ascent: zone melting, penetrative intrusion, and stopping. They find that zone melting offers the greatest potential for modifying magma composition, while penetrative intrusion offers the least possibility of contamination. The Adamello complex is used as an example to demonstrate these processes and their implications for magma migration and contamination.
