tldr: The authors created engineered hetero-dimers of Escherichia coli glutathione reductase by combining a fully functional active site with a crippled one. This allowed them to study protein-protein interactions and molecular recognition at the subunit interface of the enzyme. The results showed that the effect of the H439Q mutation was retained within the active site that accommodated it and was not transmitted through the protein to the second active site across the subunit interface.
