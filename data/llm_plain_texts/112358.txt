tldr: John Tyndall's experiments demonstrate a new series of chemical reactions produced by light using the concentrated beam of an electric lamp. He discovered that the more refrangible rays, such as blue light, are the most chemically active. This research sheds light on the relationship between a liquid and its vapor and raises questions about the mechanism of absorption and the seat of its action in molecular physics.
