tldr: This article investigates the inheritance of longevity and the selective death-rate in humans. The authors analyze the correlation between the ages at death of fathers and sons, as well as brothers, to determine the extent to which the duration of life is inherited. They conclude that there is a substantial selective death-rate at work on mankind, which may amount to four times the non-selective death-rate. This demonstrates the importance of natural selection in determining the fit duration of life in humans.
