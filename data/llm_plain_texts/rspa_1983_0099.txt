tldr: The authors present a detailed analysis of the Gray-Yang'skeleton' model of hydrocarbon oxidation, which unifies the thermal and chain branching theories. They investigate the nature of thermokinetic steady states and the transitions between them, focusing on the existence of stable limit cycles, oscillations, and bifurcations. The study shows good agreement with experimental observations in continuously stirred tank reactors, particularly for the combustion of acetaldehyde.
