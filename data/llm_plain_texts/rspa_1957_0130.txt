tldr: The article studies the collapse mechanisms of rigid-plastic plates with a square yield diagram, focusing on the distribution of plastic hinges and minimizing the resulting collapse load. It provides an upper-bound solution for various plate shapes and boundary conditions, including square, rectangular, circular, and triangular plates with simply supported or clamped edges.
