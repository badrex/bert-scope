tldr: The authors examine the potential impact of low efficacy HIV-1 vaccines in communities with high rates of infection using mathematical models and epidemiological data. They find that it will be difficult to block HIV-1 transmission even with high levels of mass vaccination. However, vaccines with efficacy of 50% or less and a five-year protection duration can prevent many cases of HIV infection and associated mortality. This supports the idea of proceeding with Phase III efficacy trials in high HIV transmission regions.
