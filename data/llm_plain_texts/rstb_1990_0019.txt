tldr: The article discusses the structure of bacteriorhodopsin, a light-driven hydrogen-ion pump, and its similarities to the visual opsin family, which includes receptors for hormones, peptides, and neurotransmitters. Both families have seven transmembrane helices and share topographical features, suggesting a possible evolutionary relation despite their different functions.
