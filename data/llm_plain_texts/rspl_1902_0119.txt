tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the electrical conductivity imparted to a vacuum by hot conductors, such as platinum and carbon. They found that the negative leakage from hot wires at low pressures is a definite function of the wire's temperature. The authors used the corpuscular theory of conduction in metals to explain their findings, and they concluded that the work required to force a corpuscle out of a metal varies approximately inversely as the cube root of the atomic volume of the metal. Their results provide a complete explanation of the phenomenon known as the Edison effect.
