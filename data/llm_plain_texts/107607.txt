tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the best type of steel and form for compass needles, as well as the most effective hardening techniques. They found that shear steel provides the greatest directive force, the pierced rhombus shape is the best design, and needles should be soft in the middle and hardened at the ends. These findings can improve the accuracy and usefulness of compasses for navigation and other purposes.
