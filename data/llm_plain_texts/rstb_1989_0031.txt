tldr: This article discusses the three-dimensional structure of class I histocompatibility antigens, specifically HLA-A2 and HLA-A28, determined by X-ray crystallography. The authors are refining the structures to understand the foreign-antigen binding cleft and develop a model for class II histocompatibility antigens to aid in designing experiments for peptide-binding studies.
