tldr: This article presents a method of classifying rock samples from the English Channel based on their faunal content. The authors selected 12 species and analyzed their occurrences in 43 samples. They used Forbes' coefficient of association to determine the likelihood of species occurring together and constructed a tree diagram to visualize the relationships between species. This method helps in understanding the geology and history of the English Channel region.
