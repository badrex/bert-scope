tldr: The authors present a theoretical analysis of isothermal elastohydrodynamic lubrication for concentrated contacts, focusing on non-symmetrical conditions where the lubricant entraining vector does not coincide with the principal axes of the Hertzian contact ellipse. They develop comprehensive and generalized film thickness expressions that can predict minimum and central film thickness for any entrainment angle, providing a basis for analyzing and designing various machine elements operating in the elastohydrodynamic regime of lubrication.
