tldr: This article discusses the effect of compass-needle length and arrangement on the accuracy of compass deviations. The author presents a new method for correcting the quadrantal deviation caused by the length of the compass-needle and the proximity of iron in ships. The method involves using soft iron masses and magnets to correct the deviation, improving the accuracy of navigation.
