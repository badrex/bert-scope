tldr: The authors investigated the propagation of magnetisation in iron and its relation to electric currents. They found that the time it takes for magnetisation to reverse is affected by the induced currents in the iron. This study has implications for the design of transformers and dynamo machines. Additionally, the authors discussed the variation of atmospheric temperature throughout the day and methods for observing these changes.
