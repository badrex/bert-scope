tldr: The author discusses the generation of sound aerodynamically, focusing on the expansion of acoustics in the mid-20th century. They explain the difference between sound and pseudo-sound, and how sound is generated as a by-product of airflows. The author also explores the influence of sound on airflows and the main practical problem of ground-level noise due to aircraft in flight.
