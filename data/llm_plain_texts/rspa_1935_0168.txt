tldr: The authors analyzed a new band at 4502 Ã… in the spectrum of a hollow cathode discharge in streaming ammonia. They found that the band arises from a transition and determined the rotational term differences for the upper level, which are identical to those of the 3240 band of NH. This completes the experimental verification of the existence of all stable states of the NH molecule derived by Mulliken.
