tldr: This article discusses the transmission of electric waves around the Earth and the effect of conducting layers in the atmosphere. The author investigates the mathematical treatment of electric waves and the impact of imperfectly conducting spheres on the transmission. The study focuses on the parallelism of magnetic changes in different parts of the United Kingdom and the conditions favorable for an inquiry into these changes.
