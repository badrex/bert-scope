tldr: The author, W. Snow Harris, presents an instrument for measuring electrical forces and discusses its applications in studying the elementary laws of electricity. The instrument allows for precise measurements of attractive and repulsive forces, making it useful for investigating the relationship between electrical quantity, intensity, and inductive power. The author also explores the role of inductive actions in electrical attraction and repulsion, building upon Faraday's research in the field.
