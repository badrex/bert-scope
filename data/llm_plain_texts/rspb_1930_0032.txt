tldr: The authors conducted experiments on cat muscles to determine the contraction values and numbers of individual motor-units. They removed the afferent fibers from the muscle nerves and used a myograph to measure muscle contractions. The results showed that the motor-units composing a muscle have varying individual values and an average value. This research provides insight into muscle physiology and motor-unit function.
