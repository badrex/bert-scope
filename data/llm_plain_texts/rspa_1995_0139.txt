tldr: The author proposes a new foundation for quantum mechanics, called primary state diffusion, based on non-differentiable fluctuations in spacetime on a Planck scale. This theory derives both quantum and classical behavior from the same dynamics and does not require a measurement hypothesis or interpretation. The author suggests that this theory could be tested in matter interferometry experiments within the next decade.
