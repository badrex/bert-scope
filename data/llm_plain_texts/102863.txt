tldr: 'The author, Mr. Leewuenhoek, observed rainwater under a microscope and discovered small living creatures, called animalcula, in it. These creatures were so small that they were difficult to see and appeared to move in different ways. The author also observed that these creatures were different from inanimate particles in the water, as they swam in circles and windings. He further studied the behavior of these creatures and their relationship with air bubbles in the water.'
