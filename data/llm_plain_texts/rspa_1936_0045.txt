tldr: The authors analyze the structures of stilbene, tolane, and azobenzene using X-ray diffraction. They find that these compounds have a pseudo-orthorhombic structure with four molecules in the unit cell, each possessing an exact center of symmetry. The study helps explain the observed X-ray intensities and other physical properties of the crystals.
