tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the existence and properties of Liebreich's protagon, a substance claimed to be a specific constituent of the brain. They found that the physical properties of protagon were consistent with Liebreich's description and that the substance contained phosphorus in a proportion close to that indicated by Liebreich. The authors' findings support the existence of protagon as a definite phosphorized principle contained in nervous matter.
