tldr: The authors conducted experiments to prove the objective reality of combination and summation tones using a tuning fork, a Helmholtz wind siren, and photographic techniques. They demonstrated the presence of difference tones and summation tones through interference patterns and discussed the effects of exposure time and plate velocity on the photographic documentation of these tones.
