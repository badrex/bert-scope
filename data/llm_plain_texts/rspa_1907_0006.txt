tldr: The authors conducted experiments to examine the lighter constituents of air, focusing on the separation and analysis of hydrogen. They found that the amount of hydrogen separable from air is much less than previous estimates, amounting to about one volume per million and a half volumes of air. The study also confirmed the presence of neon and helium in the air.
