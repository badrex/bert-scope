tldr: The author conducted experiments on the dissolution of various salts in water and observed that the elevation of water in a container increases upon the addition of salt. The author found that the amount of salt dissolved in water does not depend on the porosity of water, and the density of water decreases during the dissolution process. This study helps to understand the behavior of salts in water and their applications in various fields.
