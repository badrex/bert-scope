tldr: The author determined the atomic weight of protactinium using chemical methods, specifically by analyzing the ratio of potassium protactinium fluoride to protactinium pentoxide. This research confirmed Aston's work on the isotopic mass of actinium and provided a more accurate atomic weight for protactinium, which is an element in the actinium series of radioactive elements.
