tldr: The authors studied the reactivity of simple monocyclic quinones and their role in the formation of complex oxidation and condensation products of phenols, which are related to humic acids. They investigated the reactivity of different quinones and their interactions with various reagents, providing insights into the processes of humic acid formation.
