tldr: The authors conducted a study on nuclear collisions involving 8 MeV deuterons using the photographic method. They determined the energy of the excited states of the nucleus 170 by observing protons from the reaction 160(d, p)170 and a-particles from the reaction 19F(d, a)170. They identified 13 excited states of 170 and found that the Q-values of the reactions 160(d, p)170 and 19F(d, a)170, in which the 170 nucleus is formed in its ground state, are 1,928 and 10,042 MeV, respectively.
