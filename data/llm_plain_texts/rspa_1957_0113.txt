tldr: The authors studied the heat of adsorption of oxygen on uranium dioxide at -183Â°C using a non-adiabatic non-isothermal calorimeter. They found that the differential heat of adsorption decreases as the surface becomes covered, with an initial heat of adsorption of 40.5 kcal/mol. The rate of heat evolution becomes slower for successive increments of oxygen adsorbed, indicating a reaction in or on the oxide.
