tldr: The authors study the precipitation of carbides at the y-a phase boundaries in alloy steels, specifically iron-vanadium-carbon, iron-tungsten-carbon, and iron-molybdenum-carbon systems. They discover that the carbide particles form fine sheets in the ferrite matrix and propose a model for interphase precipitation based on the observed morphology and crystallography of the carbide phases and ferrite.
