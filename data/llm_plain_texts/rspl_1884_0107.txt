tldr: The author examines a new alloy called platinoid, invented by F. W. Martino, which has a high electric resistance and low variation of resistance with temperature. Platinoid is a variation of German silver with the addition of a small percentage of tungsten. The author also discusses the mechanical properties of platinoid, including its modulus of rigidity, Young's Modulus, and specific gravity.
