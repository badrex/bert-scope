tldr: The author examines the development and relations of the ciliary ganglion in Elasmobranchs, finding that it is a sympathetic ganglion related to the motor oculi and other cranial nerves. The study provides insight into the complex nature of the ciliary ganglion and its connections with other nerves, contributing to a better understanding of the nervous system in these animals.
