tldr: The author investigates the zones of influence in a two-dimensional, unsteady, hypersonic boundary layer. They develop an asymptotic structure for a linear, high-frequency, unsteady disturbance superimposed on a steady, possibly separated, nonlinear flow. The study shows that introducing a viscous-inviscid interaction into the unsteady problem drastically alters the domain of dependence of the unsteady flow throughout the entire viscous sublayer. The determination of the correct domain of dependence involves a subtle interplay between the convective terms, the pressure-displacement interaction, and the non-parallel base flow.
