tldr: 'The study found that female greater horseshoe bats that breed earlier in life have shorter lifespans. Early breeding reduces lifespan because it starts a year earlier and breeding rates are higher, but overall, there appear to be equal fitness benefits. During population recovery, earlier breeding may be advantageous until the population stabilizes.'
