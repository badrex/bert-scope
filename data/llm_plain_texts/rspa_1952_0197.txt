tldr: This article presents a theory of cohesion for polar liquids, extending the cell theory of liquid structure originally developed by Lennard-Jones and Devonshire. The authors evaluate the free energy due to dipole interactions using a model of point dipoles fixed on lattice sites but free to rotate in the electric field of others. They find that dipole interaction alone is not enough to explain the difference in cohesion between polar and non-polar liquids, and discuss the importance of other intermolecular forces between polar molecules.
