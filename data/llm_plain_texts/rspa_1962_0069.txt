tldr: 'The authors developed a method to measure sand transport in rivers using radioactive tracers. They mixed radioactive particles with a strip of the riverbed and tracked the spread of radioactivity to determine the sand transport rate. The study provided insights into how sand particles move and the role of bed ripples in the sand movement process.'
