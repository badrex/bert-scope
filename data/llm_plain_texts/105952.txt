tldr: 'The author, John Michell, investigates the probable parallax and magnitude of fixed stars based on the quantity of light they provide and their specific circumstances. He calculates the distance at which the Sun would appear as bright as other planets and stars, and discusses the challenges in determining the actual size and brightness of stars. Michell also suggests that future advancements in instruments could potentially help discover the parallax of some stars.'
