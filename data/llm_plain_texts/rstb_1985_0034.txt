tldr: The article discusses the role of thalamic structures in processing nociception and pain. It examines the thalamic areas receiving projections from spinal neurons through pathways that convey noxious inputs, such as the spinothalamic and spinoreticulothalamic tracts. The study provides insights into the integration of nociceptive messages at the thalamic level and the involvement of different thalamic structures in various aspects of nociception, including sensory discriminative and motor responses to noxious stimuli.
