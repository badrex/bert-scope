tldr: In a letter to the Reverend Thomas Birch, Dr. Josiah Tucker describes a remarkable and sudden tide event in Bristol. The tide rose unexpectedly high, then quickly receded, only to rise again. This unusual event was observed at various locations along the River Avon, with similar occurrences reported in Gloucester and Worcester. The strong, rapid tide of the River Severn was also likely affected.
