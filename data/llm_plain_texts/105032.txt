tldr: This article discusses the case of a girl presented as an hermaphrodite in London. The author, James Parsons, explains that the girl's large clitoris has been mistaken for a penis, leading to the misconception of her being an hermaphrodite. He provides a detailed description of the girl's anatomy and compares it to the anatomy of female fetuses, explaining that the size of the clitoris is a common occurrence during gestation. Parsons also mentions the practice of removing the enlarged clitoris in other cultures and cites the work of the learned De Graafe, who approved of this practice. Lastly, he addresses the lack of breasts in the girl, stating that she has as large breasts as any French girl of her age.
