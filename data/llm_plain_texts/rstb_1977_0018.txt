tldr: This article discusses the biochemistry of meiosis in Lilium, focusing on the four physiological stages: prezygotene, zygotene, pachytene, and post-pachytene. Each stage has distinctive metabolic characteristics, and the article explores the processes and functions involved in chromosome pairing, crossing over, and disjunction. The study highlights the extended S-phase, the role of Z-DNA, and the changes in nuclear lipoprotein during meiosis, providing insights into the biochemical mechanisms underlying these processes.
