tldr: The author presents a method to determine the constituent parts of the roots of algebraic equations, focusing on equations of the second and third degrees. By considering the conditions under which the roots vanish, the author demonstrates how to find the constituent parts of the roots and provides formulas for calculating them. The analysis can be applied to cubic and quadratic equations, offering a deeper understanding of the relationships between the roots.
