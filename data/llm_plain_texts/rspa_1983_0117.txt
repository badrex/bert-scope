tldr: This article presents a general formulation of the kinetic theory of solid-state diffusion applicable to systems with small degrees of vacancy and interstitial disorder. The theory is solved in the linear approximation for steady-state conditions, verifying the correctness of the phenomenological equations provided by non-equilibrium thermodynamics, including the Onsager reciprocal relation. The theory includes previous kinetic theories as special cases and demonstrates how systematic improvements in accuracy can be made within this framework.
