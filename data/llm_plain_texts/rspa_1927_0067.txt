tldr: The author investigates the relationship between the refractive and dispersive constants of inert gases. By plotting the cube roots of refractivities against the squares of apparent numbers of dispersion electrons, the points lie on a straight line, suggesting a strong correlation. The author uses this relationship to calculate and compare the values of these constants for all five inert gases.
