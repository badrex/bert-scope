tldr: The author, Baden Powell, investigates the dispersion of light using various methods, including the work of M. Cauchy and Mr. Kelland. He compares the results of these methods with experimental data and finds that Mr. Kelland's method provides a more accurate representation of the refractive indices. The author also discusses the limitations of current theories and the need for further advancements in understanding light dispersion.
