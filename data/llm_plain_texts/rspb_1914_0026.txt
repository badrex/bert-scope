semantic_tags:
  - Photosynthesis
  - Chlorophyll
  - Light absorption
  - Plant pigments
  - Plant physiology
tldr: The author investigates the effects of light on chlorophyll, exploring its role in photosynthesis and its decomposition. They found that chlorophyll is sensitive to light, and its decomposition is linked to photosynthesis. The author also discovered that different wavelengths of light have varying effects on chlorophyll, with red light causing the most rapid decomposition.
