tldr: This article presents an investigation into the mechanical equivalent of heat and the relation between electrical and mechanical units. The authors conducted experiments using a calorimeter and determined the capacity for heat of water at different temperatures. They also studied the effect of stirring rates and temperature coefficients on their findings. The results provide a better understanding of the mechanical equivalent of heat and the connection between electrical and mechanical units.
