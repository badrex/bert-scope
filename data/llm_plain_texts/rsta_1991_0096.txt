tldr: The authors review the progress made by the QUACS consortium and other atomic physics groups in Europe, the U.S.A., and Japan in calculating atomic data relevant to solar flare spectra. They discuss electron excitation rates, ionization processes, and the use of atomic data as diagnostics for probing the physical conditions in solar flares. The paper also highlights the importance of accurate atomic data for understanding solar flares and the need for further calculations for future missions like Solar-A.
