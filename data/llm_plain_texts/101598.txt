tldr: The author shares two anatomical discoveries: 1) a German physician at Montpelier discovered the vessels that convey chyle to nursing women's breasts, and 2) another person confirmed the existence of an additional urine pathway to the bladder, separate from the ureters. These findings expand our understanding of the body's systems.
