tldr: This article discusses the development and experiences with a coupled global model that integrates atmosphere, ocean, and sea-ice components. The model is used to study the climate response to factors such as changing CO2 concentrations and the role of the ocean in determining weather patterns on seasonal timescales. The authors describe the ocean and sea-ice components of the model and present some characteristics of the ocean model when driven by observed fluxes of heat, fresh water, and momentum during a long spin-up experiment. They also discuss aspects of a four-year integration of the coupled model and future plans for its development.
