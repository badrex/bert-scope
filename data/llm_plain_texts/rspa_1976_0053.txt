tldr: The authors describe an apparatus that uses a laser to induce optical birefringence in various liquid media. They employed blue light from a low-powered argon laser to monitor the birefringence in the sample cell while the infrared radiation of a neodymium-doped laser interacted with the sample molecules. The study focused on demonstrating the effects in dilute solutions of macromolecules. The researchers observed the optical Kerr effect in suspensions of bentonite clay and potassium hyaluronate in water, providing a new method for studying high-frequency polarization processes and characterizing colloids and polymers.
