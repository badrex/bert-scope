tldr: The author discusses the role of probability in scientific inference and criticizes the reliance on a priori assumptions in the theory of relativity. He argues that any theory capable of justifying generalization must make some assumptions, and the issue lies in whether these assumptions are made or if generalization is entirely abandoned. The author also highlights the importance of experimental verification in accepting scientific theories.
