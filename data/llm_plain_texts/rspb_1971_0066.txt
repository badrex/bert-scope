tldr: The author investigates the factors that determine the duration of meiosis in plants, finding that it is positively correlated with DNA content per nucleus and mitotic cycle time. However, meiotic duration is not solely determined by DNA content but is also influenced by chromosomal organization, DNA structure, and the organism's developmental pattern. The study suggests that DNA affects development both through its informational content and through its physical mechanical effects, independent of its informational content.
