tldr: The authors studied the ash deposits from the 1971 eruption of Mount Etna's new explosion crater. They found that the eruption started as strombolian-type, ejecting juvenile scoria, but later changed due to pre-existing pyroclastic debris sliding into the crater. The ash fell as damp, flocculated clumps, and as it dried, much of the fine dust was blown away by the wind. The study suggests that wind deflation removed more than half of the deposited ash, contributing to the loess-like soil found on the lower slopes of Mount Etna.
