tldr: This article investigates the nuclear moment of the indium atom by examining the spectral lines in its spark and arc spectra. The authors use various experimental methods to study the structure and intensity of these lines, concluding that the nuclear moment of the indium atom is likely to be h/2π. Their findings help to refine the understanding of atomic transitions and the properties of the indium atom.
