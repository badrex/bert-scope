tldr: This article discusses experiments conducted on the adsorption of radium D and radium E by various precipitates and the influence of solution acidity. The authors found that the degree of adsorption is affected by the solubility of the corresponding active compounds and the type of precipitate. They also discovered that radium D is more readily adsorbed in acidic solutions, while radium E is more adsorbed in neutral solutions. The results indicate that isotopic precipitates do not have a greater adsorptive power than non-isotopic precipitates.
