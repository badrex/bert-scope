tldr: The article discusses the discovery of GABA-induced potassium channels in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. These channels appear after a delay and are associated with GABAb receptors. The study suggests that binding of GABA to GABAb receptors activates a second messenger system, causing the opening of oligomeric potassium channels.
