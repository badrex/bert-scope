tldr: The authors studied deformation twinning in materials with the A4 crystal structure, such as silicon, germanium, gallium antimonide, indium antimonide, and zinc blende. They found that deformation twins form under specific temperature and stress conditions, and observed twins on {111} and {123} planes. This research helps to understand the mechanical properties and behavior of materials with the A4 crystal structure.
