tldr: The authors apply the spin-coupled theory of molecular wavefunctions to study the structure and properties of LiH, BH, and HF molecules. They use a single configuration of non-orthogonal orbitals and a linear combination of two configurations to construct the wavefunctions. The calculated molecular properties, such as binding energy, equilibrium internuclear distance, and dipole moment, are in excellent agreement with experimental values.
