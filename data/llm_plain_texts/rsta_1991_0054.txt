tldr: This article investigates the behavior and influence of fluids in subduction zones, focusing on element fluxes associated with subduction-related magmatism. The authors analyze isotopic and trace element data from various destructive plate margins to understand the contribution of different materials to arc magmas. They find that the net flux of elements from the mantle to the crust above subduction zones is more complex than previously thought, and that the contribution from subducted sediment and the mantle wedge may vary significantly.
