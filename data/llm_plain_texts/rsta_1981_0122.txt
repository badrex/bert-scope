tldr: This article argues that the Earth's continental crust is recycled into the mantle, maintaining a near-steady state with constant volumes of ocean and crust through geological time. The author presents evidence from isotope data, crustal thickness, and planetary analogies to support the hypothesis of crustal recycling and challenges the traditional view of continental growth.
