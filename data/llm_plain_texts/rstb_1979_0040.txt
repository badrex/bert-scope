tldr: The article discusses the potential use of skeletal deformities in fish as indicators of marine pollution. It reviews the occurrence, effects, causative factors, and possible mechanisms of skeletal deformities in fish and suggests that these deformities could be a useful biological variable for monitoring marine pollution due to their irreversible nature and ease of detection.
