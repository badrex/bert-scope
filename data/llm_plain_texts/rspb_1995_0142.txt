revised_title: 'Exploring Complex Dynamics in Frequency-Dependent Selection'

  - Transient Chaos
tldr: The authors study a simple deterministic model of frequency-dependent selection in population genetics and demonstrate that it can exhibit complex dynamic behavior, including cycles, chaos, transient chaos, and intermittency. These findings provide an explanation for erratic dynamics of gene frequencies in natural populations.
