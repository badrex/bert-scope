tldr: 'The author, Benj. Langwith, observed and documented various figures of snow crystals under different weather conditions. He described the shapes and sizes of snowflakes, comparing them to previous observations by Descartes, Dr. Grew, and Mr. Morton. Langwith also made conjectures about the formation of snow crystals, suggesting that different figures might result from different crystallization processes.'
