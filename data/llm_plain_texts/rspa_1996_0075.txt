tldr: This article presents a rigorous study of lower bounds on image magnification in single-plane gravitational lensing. The author determines these bounds for the total magnification of point sources undergoing lensing by a general single-plane gravitational lens. The lower bounds adjust according to the number of images of the source, the number of obstruction points of the deflector potential, and the mass density of the lens. The study uses Morse theoretic tools, providing a new approach to the study of lower bounds on image magnification in gravitational lensing.
