tldr: The authors investigated the metabolic pathways of Bacillus cloacae when fermenting citric and malic acids. They found that the organism could not grow on ammonium malate without oxygen. The study showed that the bacteria converted citric acid into acetic acid and carbon dioxide, while malic acid was decomposed into succinic acid. This research provided insights into the metabolic processes of this facultative anaerobe.
