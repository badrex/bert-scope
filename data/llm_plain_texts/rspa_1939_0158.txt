tldr: This article discusses the temperature measurements and investigations conducted in deep boreholes in the Transvaal and Orange Free State. The authors analyze the temperature variations and the factors affecting the geothermal step, such as the thermal conductivity of rocks and the presence of groundwater. They also examine the stability of the boreholes and the potential impact of convection currents on the temperature measurements.
