tldr: The article discusses the use of molecular phylogenies in two areas relevant to wildlife conservation: describing biodiversity and inferring population processes. Molecular phylogenies can help identify evolutionarily significant units and geographic areas with phylogeographic structure, which can be targeted for conservation efforts. Additionally, molecular phylogenies can provide information on population size, connectivity, and historical processes, which are essential for managing declining or fragmented species.
