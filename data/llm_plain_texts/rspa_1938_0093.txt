tldr: The authors provide a proof for the dispersion formula for nuclear reactions, which states that the cross-sections for all nuclear reactions are determined by the positions of resonance levels and the properties of metastable states. The proof is based on the assumption that the widths of the resonance levels contributing to the process are smaller than the distances between the levels.
