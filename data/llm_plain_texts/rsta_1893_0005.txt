revised_title: Ionic Velocities and Electrolytic Theory
semantic_tags:
  - Electrochemistry
  - Ionic velocity
  - Kohlrausch's theory
  - Electrolysis
  - Ionization
tldr: The authors discuss the concept of ionic velocities and Kohlrausch's theory, which explains the motion of ions in electrolytes. They also explore the relationship between the theory and the idea of ionization, showing that both can coexist and provide a better understanding of the behavior of ions in solutions.
