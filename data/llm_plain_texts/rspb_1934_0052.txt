tldr: The authors investigated the kinetics of hemoglobin's reactions with carbon monoxide and oxygen. They found that the rates of these reactions are slower than those of oxygen, making them easier to study. The study provides a deeper understanding of the reactions and their implications in various physiological processes, such as blood volume determination and coal gas poisoning treatment. The authors also explored the theoretical basis of these reactions using the Langmuir-type and intermediate complex theories.
