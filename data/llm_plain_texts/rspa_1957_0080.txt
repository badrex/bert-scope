tldr: The authors investigated the thickness of the saturated helium film above and below the -point using an improved optical method. They found that the film thickness is nearly independent of temperature from to 2 K. The results showed that the film is essentially the same above and below the -point, and the thickness varies little between and. The authors discussed the differences between their results and those of other investigations of the helium film.
