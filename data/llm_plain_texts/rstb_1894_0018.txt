tldr: The author conducted a series of experiments on animals to study the functions of the cerebellum. They found that the cerebellum plays a crucial role in coordinating voluntary movements and maintaining balance. Damage to the cerebellum resulted in uncoordinated and disordered movements, while partial or complete removal of the organ led to loss of the ability to regulate and control movements. The study provides insights into the importance of the cerebellum in motor control and its impact on various types of movements.
