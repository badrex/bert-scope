tldr: The authors studied the physicochemical properties and structure of poly-D-glutamic acid from Bacillus anthracis grown in vitro. They examined the effects of ionic strength, concentration, and molecular weight on the viscosity, light scattering, diffusion, and sedimentation of the poly-D-glutamic acid. The results indicate that the particles have a bulky structure and contract with increasing ionic strength.
