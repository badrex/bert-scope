tldr: This article examines the structure and organization of fossil plant roots from the coal measures, specifically the roots of Calamites. The authors conclude that these roots have characteristics similar to those of modern vascular plants, including a well-marked medulla, primary xylem-strands, and endogenous branching. The study provides insights into the anatomy and development of these ancient plants.
