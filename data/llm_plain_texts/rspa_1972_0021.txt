tldr: The authors studied the initiation of polymerization by the reaction between tetrakis(triphenyl phosphite)nickel(0) and halides in methyl methacrylate. They found that the kinetics of the reaction are consistent with a mechanism involving ligand displacement by the monomer, leading to a reactive species that can be oxidized by the halide. The authors determined the rate constants, equilibrium constants, and associated enthalpy and entropy changes for the reaction, providing a better understanding of the process.
