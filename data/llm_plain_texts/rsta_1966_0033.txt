tldr: The author discusses the formation of microjets in liquids under impact or shock, and their role in deformation and erosion processes. Microjets can cause significant damage to solids due to their high velocity and impact pressure. The author presents various experiments demonstrating the formation and effects of microjets in different scenarios, such as liquid impact on stainless steel, compression of cavities, and coalescing drops.
