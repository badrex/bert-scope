revised_title: 'The Interaction of Conjugated Systems and its Impact on Bond Orders'
semantic_tags:
  - Conjugated Systems
  - Molecular Orbital Theory
  - Resonance Energy
  - Bond Order
  - Aromaticity
tldr: The authors explore the interaction of two conjugated systems and the resulting increase in bond order. They demonstrate that conjugation energies are always positive, leading to increased stability in conjugated systems. The authors also discuss the calculation of conjugation energies and their relationship with bond orders, providing examples of conjugated hydrocarbons.
