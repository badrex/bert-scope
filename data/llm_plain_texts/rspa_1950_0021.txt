tldr: The authors studied the benzoyl peroxide photosensitized copolymerization of styrene and methyl methacrylate to determine the rate coefficients and understand the kinetics of copolymerization. They found that the introduction of small quantities of styrene lowered the rate of initiation, and they calculated the absolute velocity coefficients for all the steps in the reaction. This research provided valuable information about the reactivity of radicals and the mechanism of copolymerization.
