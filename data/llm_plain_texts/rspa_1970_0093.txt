tldr: The authors analyze the concept of faster-than-light group velocities and their relation to causality violation. They demonstrate that the appearance of superluminal group velocities is not a sufficient condition for causality violation and that Lorentz-invariant wave equations, including the Feinberg 'tachyon', are causal. They also discuss the propagation of Klein-Gordon waves and Bludman-Ruderman sound waves, concluding that they do not violate causality.
