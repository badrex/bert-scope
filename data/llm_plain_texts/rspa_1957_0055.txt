tldr: This article investigates the emission spectra produced by shock waves, flames, and detonations. The authors compare the spectra of various gases, including fuel and fuel + argon mixtures, excited by strong shock waves from a bursting diaphragm with those given by flames and spark- or shock-ignited detonations. The study provides insights into the chemical reactions and processes occurring in these phenomena, with implications for understanding flame behavior and the propagation of detonations.
