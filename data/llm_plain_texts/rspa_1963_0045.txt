tldr: The authors studied the magnetization of face-centred cubic and body-centred cubic iron-nickel alloys. They found that the magnetization differs widely between the two crystal structures, and the average magnetic moment carried by each alloy atom was calculated. This research provides insights into the magnetic behavior of iron-nickel alloys, which are important both technologically and fundamentally in understanding ferromagnetism.
