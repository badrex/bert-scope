tldr: The authors investigated the aerodynamic resistance to a sphere rotating at high speed, focusing on the boundary layer regime. They used a magnetic suspension technique to study the flow around the rotating sphere and observed that gas flows from the poles to the equator, forming a narrow planar radial jet. The measured drag torque on the sphere was higher than the predicted value, and the authors discussed possible reasons for this discrepancy.
