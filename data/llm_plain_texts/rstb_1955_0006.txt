tldr: The author reinterprets the spirodistichous phyllotaxis in Rhoeo discolor, a monocotyledon, by proposing a space-filling theory of leaf determination. This theory explains the displacement of new leaves without the need for physiological repulsions, as previously suggested. The author also describes the development of axillary buds and seedlings and the asymmetries of leaves in relation to this new interpretation.
