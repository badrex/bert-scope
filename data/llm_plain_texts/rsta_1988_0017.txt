tldr: This article discusses the spectroscopy of the hydrogen molecular ion at its dissociation limit. The authors review previous theoretical and experimental work on the ion and its deuterium isotopes, and describe spectroscopic studies of the vibration-rotation levels. They also discuss the nuclear-hyperfine and spin-rotation structure, and present observations of vibration-rotation satellite lines that yield absolute values of the deuterium hyperfine constants. The authors describe their attempts to observe radiofrequency-infrared double-resonance spectra.
