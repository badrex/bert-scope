tldr: The study investigates the effects of water and isotonic saline administration on renal plasma and glomerular filtrate flows in dogs. It shows that renal plasma and filtrate flows increase after water administration, while isotonic saline only increases the filtrate flow. The results suggest a relationship between intratubular pressure and preglomerular vessel resistance in regulating these flows.
