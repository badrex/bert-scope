tldr: The author, G. Golding Bird, conducted experiments on the electro-chemical effects of long-continued electric currents of low tension. He discovered that using his apparatus, various metals could be deposited in a metallic form, including silver, copper, and even refractory metallic oxides like silica. He also found that he could form amalgams of potassium, sodium, and ammonium with mercury by decomposing their chloride solutions using a feeble voltaic current. However, he noted that interrupting the current for even a few seconds could destroy the product formed.
