tldr: The authors isolated nuclei from various plant species and measured the amounts of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) in them. They found that the DNA/RNA ratio varied from about unity to more than ten, regardless of the plant species or the type of tissue present. The authors also discovered that the DNA/RNA ratio increased when plants were grown at higher temperatures.
