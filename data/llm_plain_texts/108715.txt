tldr: The author, John Henry Pratt, investigates the deflection of the plumb-line in India caused by the attraction of the Himalayan Mountains and other elevated regions. He proposes a hypothesis of a deficiency of matter below the mountain mass to explain the observed deflections. Pratt's calculations show that this hypothesis can account for the observed deflections and provides insights into the Earth's crust and its density variations.
