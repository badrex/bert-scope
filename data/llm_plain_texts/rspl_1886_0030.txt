tldr: This paper examines the effects of stress and magnetization on the thermoelectric quality of iron. The authors found that cyclic changes in stress cause changes in thermoelectric quality and magnetism, with a tendency to lag behind the changes in stress, called hysteresis. They discovered that stress affects the thermoelectric quality of iron directly and not as a secondary effect of magnetization. The authors also studied the effects of magnetization on the thermoelectric properties of other metals and discussed the possible relation of hysteresis to the properties of granular media.
