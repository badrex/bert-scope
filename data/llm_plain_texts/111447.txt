tldr: The author, George Bowdler Buckton, successfully isolated and studied the properties of mercuric methyl, a compound containing the hypothetical radical hydrargyro-methylium. He found that mercuric methyl is a highly combustible, colorless liquid with a faint sweetish odor. It is soluble in alcohol and ether and has a specific gravity greater than any known non-metallic liquid at ordinary temperature. Buckton also explored the reactions and properties of mercuric methyl with various reagents, such as iodine, bromine, and acids.
