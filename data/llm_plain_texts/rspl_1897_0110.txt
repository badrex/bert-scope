tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the effect of temperature on thermal conductivities and the relationship between the conductivity of a mixture and its constituents. The study included various solids, liquids, and mixtures, revealing that solids and liquids generally decrease in conductivity with increasing temperature, and the conductivity of a mixture lies between the conductivities of its constituents.
