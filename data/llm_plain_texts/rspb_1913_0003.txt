tldr: This study investigates the metabolism of lactating women and the excretion of creatin. The researchers found that a creatin-free diet was challenging for the women, as they desired meat and tasty food. The investigation focused on primiparae, and the results showed a quantitative relation between creatin excretion and milk in nursing women. The study also discusses the possible role of the liver in the metabolic changes during lactation.
