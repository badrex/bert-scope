tldr: This article investigates the specific heats of air, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen at constant volume over a range of pressures from 7 to 25 atmospheres. It finds that the specific heats of these gases are not constant and vary with density. The experiments reveal that the specific heat of air increases with density, while the specific heat of carbon dioxide and hydrogen decrease with density. The results are in harmony with other experiments on the specific heat and mechanical equivalent of heat.
