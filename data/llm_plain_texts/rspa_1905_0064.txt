tldr: The author investigates the electrical conductivity of dilute solutions of sulphuric acid in different solvents and finds that the presence of impurities, such as carbon dioxide, affects the equivalent conductivity of the solution. The study concludes that the presence of impurities does not fully explain the phenomenon of the low equivalent conductivity in very dilute acid solutions.
