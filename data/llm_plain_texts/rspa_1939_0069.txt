tldr: This article describes high-altitude cosmic radiation measurements conducted near the North geomagnetic pole using a balloon technique. The authors discuss the apparatus used and the results obtained during the expedition. They found no significant increase in cosmic radiation intensity near the top of the atmosphere, indicating that low-energy charged particles do not reach the Earth in appreciable quantities.
