tldr: This article explores the mathematical properties and enumeration of rotational tessellations and copses, which are based on an infinite background of nodes at the vertices of a plane tessellation of unit equilateral triangles. The author studies the symmetry and construction of these patterns, focusing on their rotational and reflexive symmetry properties. The article also discusses the Pascal matrix and its eigen-system, as well as the properties and enumeration of the polynomials and sequences formed from its row- and column-eigenvectors.
