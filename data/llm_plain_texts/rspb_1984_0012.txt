tldr: The study investigates the effects of a diet enriched in vitamin A acetate or in vivo administration of interleukin-2 on neonatal tolerance. The results show that both the VAA diet and IL-2 treatment can counteract a tolerogenic stimulus, leading to a reduced tolerance and faster allograft rejection in mice. This finding supports the hypothesis that two signals are required for T-cell activation, and it broadens the possibilities of using retinoid substances and IL-2 as immunopharmacological agents.
