revised_title: 'Ancient Bacterial DNA in Clarkia Fossils'
semantic_tags:
  - Ancient DNA
  - Bacterial DNA
  - Fossil molecules
  - Biochemical systemics
  - Molecular biology
tldr: 'The authors discovered bacterial DNA in Clarkia fossils, indicating that ancient DNA can be preserved in plant compression fossils. They used bacterial primers to amplify DNA sequences from the extracts and found that the high molecular mass DNA present in some extracts was mostly of bacterial origin. This discovery has implications for the study of ancient DNA and the potential to retrieve plant sequences from these remains.'
