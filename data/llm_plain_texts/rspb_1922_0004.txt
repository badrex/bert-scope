  - Bacterial variability

  - Hyper-agglutinable forms
  - Bacterial serology
tldr: The authors studied the variability and agglutinability of certain bacteria, observing dys-agglutinable, eu-agglutinable, and hyper-agglutinable forms. They found that these differences were due to antigenic differences and could be influenced by cultivating bacteria in agglutinating serum. The study aimed to understand the nature and origin of serological strains in bacteria and the factors affecting their agglutinability.
