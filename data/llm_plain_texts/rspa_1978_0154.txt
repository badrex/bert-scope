tldr: The 1975-76 drought in England and Wales severely affected British agriculture, causing crop production to decline, grassland growth to be restricted, and livestock to experience reduced milk yields and longer fattening times. The dry weather led to soil moisture deficits, pest and disease build-up, and poor quality water supplies, resulting in losses of sheep, pigs, and calves due to high temperatures. The drought's long-term effects included enhanced persistence of soil acting herbicides and residues.
