tldr: The authors, Sir Norman Lockyer and William J. S. Lockyer, investigate short-period pressure variations over large areas, including India, Ceylon, Java, Mauritius, and Australia. They find that these variations are similar across the areas and are connected meteorologically. They also discover that pressure variations in the United States, particularly in stations with northern latitudes, are inversely related to those in the Indian region, suggesting a global connection between pressure changes and solar activity.
