tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of vibration-rotation interaction on line strengths in the vibration bands of deuterium cyanide. They confirmed an effect predicted by Gallup, which results in a weakening of lines in one branch and an enhancement in the other branch. The results provided information about the molecular force field and helped clarify previous ambiguities about dipole derivatives with respect to symmetry coordinates.
