tldr: The author, William Reid Clanny, presents a lamp design that provides a steady light in coal mines without the risk of explosion. The lamp uses a closed system that prevents the ignition of inflammable air in the mine, ensuring safety for miners. The lamp can be used in coal mines, powder magazines, and gunpowder manufacturing sites.
