tldr: This article discusses the computation of radiative heating rates in the atmosphere, focusing on the interaction of molecules with radiation and the effects of temperature, humidity, and cloud patterns. The authors present a method for calculating heating rates using electronic computers and explore the relationship between temperature and absorption coefficients. They also mention the importance of high-resolution spectroscopy in understanding the behavior of minor atmospheric constituents.
