tldr: This article investigates the effectiveness of addition agents in preventing wear in boundary lubrication conditions. The authors found that compounds containing phosphorus or other elements of group V form a metal phosphide on the surface, which aids in maintaining a polish and reducing wear. The addition of long-chain polar compounds with these agents further enhances wear prevention.
