tldr: The authors explore the matrix element of a dynamical variable between two bound states using the Bethe-Salpeter formalism. They demonstrate how to calculate propagators and matrix elements for any dynamical variable, providing a complete solution to quantum field theory. The method is applied to bound and scattering states, including incoming and outgoing composite particles.
