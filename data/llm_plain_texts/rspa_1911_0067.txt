tldr: This study investigates the radiation emitted by coal-gas and air mixtures during explosions and subsequent cooling. The research found that the total radiation emitted is proportional to the product of the maximum temperature and the time of explosion. Additionally, the emission of radiation in the initial stages of cooling after explosion is a function of both temperature and time from ignition. The findings also show that carbonic acid gas emits radiation about twice as strongly as an equal volume of water vapor at the same temperature.
