tldr: The authors, C. A. Coulson and H. C. Longuet-Higgins, explore the electronic structure of conjugated systems, focusing on changes in bond orders due to changes in Coulomb terms or resonance integrals. They discuss the concept of mutual bond and its relation to bond order in alternant hydrocarbons. The authors also calculate bond orders and mutual bond polarizabilities for various hydrocarbons, such as benzene, naphthalene, and styrene, and provide insights into the effects of chemical substitution on bond orders.
