tldr: This article investigates the modulation of fluorescent light in a double resonance experiment at low frequencies. The authors discovered new resonance phenomena that do not appear when the resonance frequency is greater than the natural width of the energy levels. The theoretical predictions match the experimental results, and a classical model is also applied to explain the phenomena.
