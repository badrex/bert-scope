tldr: The authors investigate the binding energies of light hypernuclei using a method that includes the effect of a possible hard core in the -nucleon potential. They find that a central, spin-dependent potential with a hard core leads to the observed binding energies. The existence of the hyperdeuteron is shown to be most unlikely.
