tldr: The authors investigated the absorption spectrum of Ag I using synchrotron radiation as the source of continuum. They observed over 50 new transitions, which can be classified into Rydberg series due to excitation of one electron from the 4d subshell. The study provides insights into the complicated situation of 4d electron excitation in the free atom and helps to understand the interaction between the 4d and 5s excitation channels.
