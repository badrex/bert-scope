tldr: The author investigates the atrio-ventricular bundle, a pathway of modified muscle fibers in the heart that allows the contraction wave to pass from the atria to the ventricles. They discuss the role of nerves in the bundle and provide a detailed description of its structure and location in various mammals. The findings support the myogenic hypothesis and contribute to the understanding of the heart's conduction system.
