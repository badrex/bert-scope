tldr: The author, William Thomson, discovered that drawing out a film of liquid, such as a soap bubble, causes a cooling effect. This occurs due to the work done in expanding the surface area of the liquid, which results in a decrease in temperature. The amount of cooling can be calculated by considering the heat absorbed at higher temperatures and the heat released at lower temperatures.
