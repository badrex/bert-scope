tldr: Researchers discovered that barnacle larvae, called cyprids, have a preference for settling on surfaces treated with aqueous extracts of barnacles. This gregarious behavior is due to a water-soluble substance present in barnacle tissues, which influences the larvae's behavior when they explore a surface. The substance, called arthropodin, is found mainly in the integument of arthropods and is present in higher amounts in newly molted individuals. This research helps to understand the complex process of larval settlement in marine organisms.
