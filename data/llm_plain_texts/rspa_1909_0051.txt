tldr: This article investigates the decay of surface waves in a superposed layer of viscous fluid, specifically focusing on the interaction between mercury and glycerine. The author provides mathematical equations and numerical solutions to explain the rate of decay and the behavior of waves in this system. The findings have implications for understanding wave damping and the potential applications in optical instruments.
