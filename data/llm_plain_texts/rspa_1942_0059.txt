tldr: This paper examines the generation of waves on shallow water by wind, building upon previous theories by Kelvin and Jeffreys. The author incorporates a boundary layer at the water's bottom and considers energy dissipation. The study predicts the minimum wind velocity needed to create waves and the resulting wave lengths, showing good agreement with observations for depths of several centimeters.
