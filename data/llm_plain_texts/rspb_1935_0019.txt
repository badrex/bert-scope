tldr: The author investigates the existence of strains in the "Aucuba" or Yellow Mosaic virus of tomatoes and their interactions with other viruses. They discovered two distinct strains, "green" Mosaic and "yellow" Mosaic, which produce different symptoms in host plants. The study also shows that these strains can interact with other plant viruses, leading to four types of interactions. This research contributes to understanding the complexity of plant viruses and their potential applications in induced immunity.
