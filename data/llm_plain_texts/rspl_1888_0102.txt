tldr: This study investigates the innervation of pulmonary vessels and the relationship between systemic and pulmonary blood pressures. The authors conducted experiments on dogs, stimulating spinal nerves and measuring blood pressure changes in the pulmonary and systemic vessels. They found that a significant rise in aortic pressure is needed to produce an appreciable rise in pulmonary pressure, and that this rise must be sustained for some time. The results suggest that the pulmonary vessels have a system of vaso-motor nerves, which play a role in regulating blood pressure.
