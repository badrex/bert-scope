tldr: This article discusses the regulation and activation mechanisms of Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), the key enzyme in photosynthesis. The authors explain how Rubisco is activated by carbon dioxide (CO2) and magnesium ions (Mg2+), and how various phosphorylated metabolites can affect its activity. They also introduce the concept of Rubisco activase, a protein that helps maintain the enzyme's activity in living plants.
