tldr: This study describes a novel procedure for incorporating layers of alumina contaminated with electrolyte species, such as molybdenum, within anodic films to investigate mobility and growth mechanisms of anodic barrier films on aluminum. The use of mobile tracers reveals that anodic alumina forms at the metal/film and film/electrolyte interfaces, with no significant formation within the film bulk. The study also assesses film growth behavior in the vicinity of flaws and determines the proportions of film developing at the metal/film and film/electrolyte interfaces using inert and immobile argon markers.
