semantic_tags:
  - Galaxy evolution
  - Galaxy classification
  - Luminosity distribution
  - Galaxy morphology
  - Star formation
tldr: The article discusses the origin and early evolution of galaxies, focusing on the classification of evolving galaxies. It explores the differences between elliptical and spiral galaxies, analyzing their luminosity distributions, morphologies, and colors. The study suggests that the dichotomy between these two types of galaxies is deeply rooted in their formation and evolution, and that understanding this distinction can provide valuable insights into the nature of galaxies.
