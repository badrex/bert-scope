tldr: The author presents a general theory for the transport of charge and the convective dispersion of charged species through a spatially periodic porous medium under the influence of a homogeneous electric field and an applied pressure-gradient field. The theory uses macrotransport and analysis of transport phenomena in spatially periodic systems to derive expressions for the effective electrical conductivity, hydraulic permeability, streaming potential coupling, and electroosmotic coupling. The author also provides formulas for computing the mean velocity and dispersivity of charged particles in the porous medium.
