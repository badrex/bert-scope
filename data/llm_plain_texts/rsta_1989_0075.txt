tldr: 'The authors developed a comprehensive global coupled atmosphere-ocean model using a low-resolution version of the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts global atmosphere model and a global ocean model from the Max Planck Institute in Hamburg. They found that coupling both models created problems due to inconsistent fields, but applying a flux correction helped balance the mean biases and reduce the climate drift. The model's initial data and results provide valuable insights into climate studies and greenhouse effect simulations.'
