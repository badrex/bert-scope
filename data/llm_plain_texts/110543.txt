tldr: The author, with the help of Mr. Jones and Mr. Russell, computed numerous tables to understand the tides and their changes. They found that the Port of London's tide establishment has changed since the beginning of the century, making it difficult to predict the time of high water accurately. The author also mentioned a very old tide table, suggesting that the time of high water at London was an hour later in the past.
