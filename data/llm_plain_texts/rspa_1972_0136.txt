tldr: The authors studied the photolysis of ozone by ultraviolet radiation and the reactions of O(1D) with O2 and O3. They used two techniques to measure the relative quantum yields for ozone decomposition and the concentrations of ground state oxygen. The results showed that there are two pathways for the reaction between O(1D) and O3, and there is no evidence for the production of an excited molecular product. This research helps to understand the processes occurring in the Earth's atmosphere.
