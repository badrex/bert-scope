tldr: The authors measured the viscosities and thermal conductivities of various organic vapors at different temperatures and pressures. They found that the ratio of viscosity to thermal conductivity is related to the type of vapor, with non-polar vapors having a higher ratio, and polar vapors having a lower ratio. The results provide insights into the transport properties of gases and the behavior of molecules in different types of vapors.
