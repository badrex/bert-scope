tldr: This article discusses the study of past variations in the lunar environment using various techniques to analyze solar wind, solar flares, galactic cosmic rays, and micrometeorites. The authors find that the lunar environment has remained relatively constant in the recent geological past, but the analysis of lunar cores and breccias may extend the record back further in time, providing insights into the early history of the Sun and Moon.
