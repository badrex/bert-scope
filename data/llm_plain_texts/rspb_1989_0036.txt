tldr: The study investigates the effects of cyclodiene (endrin) and cyclohexane (lindane) insecticides on y-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors in the central nervous system of the cockroach. The results show that endrin and lindane block functional insect neuronal GABA receptors, suggesting that these insecticides inhibit GABA-receptor function and may cause convulsive seizures and increased neuronal activity.
