tldr: In 1759, a turnpike road construction project in Wardlow, Derbyshire, uncovered a mysterious stone monument containing the remains of 17 individuals. The monument featured a circle with 32 yards in diameter and 5 feet high, made of stones from a nearby quarry. The bodies were placed on flat stones, with their heads and breasts protected by small walls. This discovery sparked curiosity and interest in the history and purpose of the monument, which remains a subject of study and speculation.
