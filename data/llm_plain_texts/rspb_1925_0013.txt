tldr: 'This article describes the central and reflex regulation of circulation using crossed circulation experiments. The authors developed a technique that allows them to study vasomotor effects and differentiate between central and reflex-originated responses. They found that the crossed circulation method maintains the animal's circulatory system in a normal state while providing full control to the experimenter. This technique helps in understanding the regulation of blood pressure and blood flow in response to different stimuli.'
