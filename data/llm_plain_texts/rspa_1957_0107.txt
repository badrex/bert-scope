revised_title: Conformal Solutions and Virial Functions
semantic_tags:
  - Conformal solutions
  - Virial functions
  - Thermodynamics
  - Statistical mechanics
  - Chemical equilibrium
tldr: The authors develop a second-order theory of conformal solutions, focusing on the virial functions and their relationship to the free energy. They provide expressions for the first derivatives of the free energy and discuss the intermolecular virial function and its role in chemical equilibrium.
