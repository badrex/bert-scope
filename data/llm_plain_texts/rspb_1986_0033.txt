tldr: Researchers used a novel electrofluorescence method to study the binding geometry of racemic mixtures of anti-diol-epoxide derivatives of three polycyclic hydrocarbon carcinogens to DNA. The results showed that these anti-configurations bind in a manner consistent with the planar diol-epoxide ring being inclined at approximately 90 degrees to the DNA axis. This binding is different from regular intercalative interaction and may be significant in understanding the molecular interactions preceding cancer.
