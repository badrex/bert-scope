revised_title: Generalizations of Pade Approximants and the Theorem of de Montessus

tldr: The authors extend the theorem of de Montessus to two-variable approximants, which are generalizations of Pade approximants. They provide new convergence theorems and analyze the errors in the coefficients of the approximants. This study applies to double power series and can be extended to series in more than two variables under certain conditions.
