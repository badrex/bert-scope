semantic_tags:
  - Metal Plasticity
  - Crystal Structure
  - Deformation Mechanisms
  - Dislocations
  - Strain Hardening
tldr: 'A group of scientists discuss the phenomenon of plastic flow in metals, focusing on the role of dislocations and the factors affecting the resistance to plastic flow. They explore various theories and experimental observations, including the effects of strain hardening, the role of slip-bands, and the influence of crystal structure on the deformation process.'
