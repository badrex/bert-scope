revised_title: 'Eutrophication and Nutrient Dynamics in Dutch Coastal Waters'
semantic_tags:
  - Eutrophication
  - Coastal Water Quality
  - Nutrient Pollution
  - River Discharge
  - Phytoplankton
tldr: This article discusses the eutrophication of Dutch coastal waters, focusing on the nutrient regime, river discharge, and its impact on phytoplankton populations. The authors analyze the concentrations of phosphorus, nitrogen, and silicate in the Rhine and other rivers, and their effects on the coastal waters' nutrient values and ratios. They also explore the consequences of these changes on the stability of the phytoplankton regime and the overall health of the ecosystem.
