tldr: "Arthur George Tansley was a prominent British botanist and ecologist who made significant contributions to the understanding of plant ecology. Born in 1871, Tansley studied at University College London and Cambridge University, where he developed a strong interest in botany. He later worked as an assistant to Frank Oliver at University College London before becoming a lecturer in botany at Cambridge. Tansley's work laid the foundation for modern plant ecology and his influence can still be seen in the field today."
