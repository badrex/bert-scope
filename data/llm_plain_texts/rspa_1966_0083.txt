tldr: The author proposes a generalized mechanism for superexchange in ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic compounds, using concepts of bond orbitals and unrestricted Hartree-Fock orbitals. The theory predicts the interaction nature and strength in compounds with different cation-anion-cation angles, and is applied to compounds with corundum-ilmenite and spinel structures, correlating their magnetic structures and transition temperatures.
