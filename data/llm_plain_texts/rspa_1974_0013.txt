tldr: The authors study the motion of dislocations in a single slip-plane under the action of their mutual repulsion and an independent applied stress. They develop a continuous distribution model and use a complex function to represent the dislocation density distribution. The method is applied to discuss the motion near the ends of a group, spatial moments of a group, and the asymptotic behavior of a group at large times.
