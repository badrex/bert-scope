tldr: The authors study three isothermal model reaction schemes that can exhibit clock reaction behavior, focusing on the iodate-arsenous-acid reaction. They identify two types of reaction mechanisms that can lead to clock reaction behavior and analyze the mathematical models to understand the induction and inhibition periods, as well as the evolutionary structure of the reactions.
