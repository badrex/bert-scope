tldr: The author observed unusual horizontal refraction of the air, which caused ships to appear as double images in the sky. This phenomenon was particularly noticeable at Ramsgate, where the author made detailed observations of the effects. The author suggests that this effect could be useful in ship navigation and recommends appointing observers to monitor these phenomena.
