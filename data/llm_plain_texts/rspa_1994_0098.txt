tldr: The authors extended the classical Kirchhoff's method to account for the presence of an imposed ambient flow field and the effect of surface deformation of a non-rigid body. They assumed a weak non-uniformity in the flow, allowing them to calculate the hydrodynamical loads acting on the deformable body. The derived system of nonlinear differential equations possesses a first integral, which can be interpreted as an energy-type conservation law. This work is relevant to the study of self-propulsion of bubbles, drops, cavities, and other deformable shapes in non-uniform flow fields.
