tldr: This study evaluates the use of higher taxa as a proxy for species-level biodiversity patterns using a large database of eastern Pacific marine molluscs. The research finds that while higher taxa can be useful for general species-level patterns, they cannot adequately resolve regional variations. The authors recommend calibrating genera as proxies for species-level patterns by using well-sampled local assemblages for regional studies.
