tldr: The author presents calculations and experiments on the intensities of electromagnetic force and couples on conductors in alternating fields. They demonstrate that the spinning of a sphere in an alternating magnetic field is due to the phase difference between the induced currents in the copper plate and the magnet's currents, rather than the sphere acting as a screen. The study also shows that a perfect conductor would be a perfect screen but would not produce a couple.
