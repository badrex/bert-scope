tldr: The authors conducted experiments on transparent solids, such as glass and celluloid, to study the stress-optical effect when strained beyond the elastic limit. They found that the artificial double refraction in these materials is dependent on the stress applied, and there is no indication of a residual stress-optical effect. The study also introduced the concepts of optical creep on loading and recovery, which describe the gradual increase and decrease of the optical effect over time.
