tldr: The authors investigated the diamagnetic susceptibilities of halide salts forming ions with inert gas configurations, specifically focusing on sodium and potassium halides. They used the Gouy method to measure the force on the specimens in an inhomogeneous magnetic field and found that the diamagnetic susceptibility of these salts is influenced by their crystal structure and the nature of the halide ions.
