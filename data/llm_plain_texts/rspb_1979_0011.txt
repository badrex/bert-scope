tldr: The study examines the effects of destroying whisker follicles in mice on the sensory nerve, thalamocortical radiation, and cortical barrel development. Electrolytic destruction of whisker follicles on the day of birth causes degeneration in the sensory nerve fibers supplying the follicles. This degeneration affects the terminations of thalamocortical fibers in the barrel region of the sensory cortex, leading to the prevention of cortical barrel formation. The research provides insights into the formation and development of cortical barrels and the role of thalamocortical radiation.
