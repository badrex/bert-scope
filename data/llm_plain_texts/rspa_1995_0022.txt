tldr: This article presents a new thermomechanical theory of mixtures of interacting continua, focusing on the balance of energy and the first law of thermodynamics. The authors develop a unified procedure to derive the basic equations for mixtures, considering the kinetic energy, heat energy, and the rate of supply of other energies. The theory is applicable to a wide range of mixtures and can be used to understand the behavior of materials and their interactions in various applications.
