revised_title: Fugitive Pressures and Explosion Data in Gas Calculations
semantic_tags:

  - Explosives
  - Gas densities
  - Pressure
  - Explosion rates
tldr: The article discusses the presence of fugitive pressures during gas explosions and suggests that data for calculating these pressures can be derived from knowledge of the densities of the unburnt gases and their rates of explosion. The author mentions the work of Mallard, Le Chatelier, and others in this field.
