tldr: The authors developed a novel crossed Fizeau interferometer that provides high-resolution spectral analysis in a compact design. This new concept uses orthogonally mounted Fizeau interferometers to output data as two-dimensional images, allowing for quantification through image detection and processing. The device offers improved resolution and spectral range while being suitable for use in adverse environments.
