tldr: The author investigates the fourth colourless sensation in the three-sensation spectrum curves when measured on the centre of the retina. They conducted experiments using a colour-patch apparatus and found that the white sensation appears to be of the same degree of "colourlessness" regardless of the light used to form the spectrum. The author also discusses the role of cones and rods in the sensation of colour and the possibility of hermaphrodite cones and rods being present in the fovea.
