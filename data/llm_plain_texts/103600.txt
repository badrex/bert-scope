tldr: George Graham observed the 1722 solar eclipse in Fleet Street, London, using a telescope with a micrometer to measure the eclipse's duration and extent. His observations were consistent with Dr. Halley's calculations, and he noted that the sky was clear during the event, except for a narrow cloud that obscured part of the sun's disk near the end. This observation helped refine the understanding of time measurement and the accuracy of astronomical calculations.
