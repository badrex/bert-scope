tldr: The authors analyze cross-current transfer processes in non-steady states, focusing on heat and mass transfer between two streams. They provide mathematical solutions for various types of disturbances and apply their findings to cross-current heat exchangers, offering insights into the behavior of these systems in real-world scenarios.
