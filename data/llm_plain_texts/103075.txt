tldr: The author describes the discovery of several nebulae or luminous spots in the sky, visible only through a telescope. These spots appear as small, bright patches or clouds and are found among fixed stars. The author discusses six such nebulae, their locations, and their possible vast sizes, suggesting that they may occupy spaces as large as our solar system. These discoveries raise questions about the nature of these celestial objects and the possibility of perpetual daylight within them.
