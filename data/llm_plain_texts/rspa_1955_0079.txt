tldr: The authors studied the effect of foreign gases, such as sulfur hexafluoride and carbon tetrafluoride, on the thermal decomposition of paraffins. They found that increasing amounts of these gases increase the rate of decomposition up to a limit. The results suggest that the foreign gas acts on a part of the reaction that is independent of the chain-breaking inhibitor, supporting the belief that the residual reaction in the presence of sufficient inhibitor is one involving direct molecular decomposition.
