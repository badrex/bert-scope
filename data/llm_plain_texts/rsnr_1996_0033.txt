tldr: The book review discusses William Whewell's efforts to define science within the context of early Victorian culture. Whewell aimed to create a philosophy of science that combined empiricism and idealism, emphasizing the role of both in scientific progress. The review highlights Whewell's work in moral sciences, his views on scientific community, and his attempts to preserve the institution of Cambridge University from political interference. The author praises Yeo's work for shedding light on Whewell's moral philosophy and its impact on science and culture during the 19th century.
