tldr: This study investigates the effects of localized brain lesions on sensory and motor functions in monkeys. The research focuses on the occipito-angular, temporal, Rolandic, frontal, and hippocampal regions and their impact on vision, hearing, motor paralysis, and tactile sensation. The findings suggest that vision and hearing can be maintained with partial damage to the relevant brain regions, while motor paralysis and anesthesia are caused by specific lesions. The study provides insights into the physiological significance of different brain regions and their functions.
