tldr: This study investigates the effects of X-rays on tumor tissue growth and vitality. The author found that X-rays can stimulate tumor growth in some cases, while in others, it can lead to negative immunity or cure. Homogeneous radiation, specifically K radiations, appears to be a promising tool for treating large masses of tissue. The results provide insights into the potential use of X-rays in cancer treatment and the development of immunity against tumors.
