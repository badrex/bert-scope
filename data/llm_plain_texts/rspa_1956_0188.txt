tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments to measure turbulent fluctuations and Reynolds stresses in a tidal current using an electromagnetic flowmeter. They observed the horizontal and vertical components of turbulent velocity at various heights above the bottom. The results provided insights into the spatial distribution of turbulence and helped advance the understanding of turbulent flow near the sea bed.'
