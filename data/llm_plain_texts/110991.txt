tldr: The author, James Glaisher, presents a method to correct meteorological observations made at different times and places to obtain accurate monthly averages. He analyzes five years of data from the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, including barometrical and thermometrical observations, and provides tables to help other observers compare their results. This study shows that with a small number of observations at convenient hours, one can obtain valuable approximate results for weather phenomena.
