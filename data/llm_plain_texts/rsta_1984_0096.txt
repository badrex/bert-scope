tldr: This article introduces optically bistable devices and photonic logic, discussing the physical principles of optical bistability and the potential for creating primitive optical computers and other signal-processing devices. It covers the concepts of nonlinearity and feedback in these devices, as well as various types of nonlinearities and feedback mechanisms. The article also explores the potential for "engineering" these devices to optimize their performance.
