tldr: The authors studied the marine life and zoogeography of the cold temperate zone in Chilean seas during the Lund University Chile Expedition in 1948-49. They found that the cold temperate fauna is better represented in the basins, while the warm temperate fauna is more common on the open coast. The distribution of species is influenced by factors such as salinity and euryhalinity, rather than just temperature. The transition between cold and warm temperate zones is gradual and broad, with some overlap between the two.
