tldr: 'M. Faraday discovered a new acid, Sulpho-naphthalic Acid, formed by the mutual action of sulphuric acid and naphthaline. The acid has distinct properties and forms a new class of salts with different bases. It can be separated by water and is soluble in both water and alcohol. Faraday also analyzed the ultimate component parts of this acid and its compound with baryta.'
