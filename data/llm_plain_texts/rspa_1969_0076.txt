tldr: This article explores the influence of retarded interactions on the spectra of mixed crystals, specifically in the deep trap limit. The authors apply McLone-Power's retarded potentials to study guest-host interactions and compare the results with static interactions. They find that the long-range part of the retarded interaction gives an energy correction that can be experimentally tested, while the intensity corrections remain unaffected.
