tldr: The authors present a new method for measuring magnetic hysteresis using a ballistic electro-dynamometer. This method allows for faster and more accurate measurements of energy dissipation in magnetic materials, enabling researchers to study the effects of various physical stresses and temperatures on hysteresis. The authors also discuss the advantages of the ballistic method over the watt-meter method, which is commonly used in commercial work.
