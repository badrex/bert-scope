tldr: The author investigates the structure and formation of pallasites, a rare type of meteorite consisting of olivine in a three-dimensional net of iron. By creating a synthetic imitation using steatite and plumber's solder, the author demonstrates that the pallasite structure can be formed by embedding angular fragments of olivine in melted nickel iron, creating a breccia with a metallic cement.
