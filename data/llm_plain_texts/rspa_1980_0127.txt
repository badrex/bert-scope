tldr: The study investigates the interaction between a plane sound wave and a Blasius boundary layer in incompressible flow. A spectral numerical method is used to analyze the two-dimensional unsteady flow over a flat plate in the presence of a plane sound wave. The results show that a Tollmien-Schlichting wave is generated with the same frequency as the sound wave, and the interaction occurs near the leading edge. The findings can aid in understanding how free-stream disturbances may affect boundary-layer transition.
