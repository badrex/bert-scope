tldr: The authors conducted a study using positron emission tomography (PET) to investigate the brain activity of 13 subjects when they perceived illusory motion in a static figure called Enigma. They found that the increase in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) occurred in areas closely related to or identical with area V5, which is responsible for visual motion perception. This suggests that the generation of illusory motion involves specific visual areas and contributions from other parts of the brain not activated when perceiving objective motion.
