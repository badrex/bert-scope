tldr: The author studied the soils and vegetation of the British Solomon Islands Protectorate during the Royal Society expedition in 1965. They found that the soils in the region are deeply weathered and leached, with low plant nutrient contents. The author also discovered that there is little evidence of a close relationship between soils and vegetation, except in soils derived from serpentine. The study provides valuable information for foresters, agriculturists, and scientists working in wet tropical areas.
