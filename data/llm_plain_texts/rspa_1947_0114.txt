tldr: The author investigates the possibility of extending wave equations for elementary particles without subsidiary conditions, focusing on Lorentz invariance and the quantization of the equations. The study aims to explore the formalism of meson and Dirac equations for particles of higher spin without using an indefinite metric in Hilbert space.
