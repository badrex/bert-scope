tldr: The author investigates the properties and heat evolution of electro-deposited antimony. They find that the change in antimony is not due to cohesive force between the particles, and the amount of heat set free by the powdered substance is not significantly different from that evolved by the substance in the coherent massive state. The study also shows that the specific heat of the substance does not decrease during the change, and the discharge of heat by electro-deposited antimony is not necessarily accompanied by an alteration of the specific heat of the substance.
