tldr: The study investigates the seasonal fluctuations in melanism frequency in the two-spot ladybird, Adalia bipunctata, and the intensity of natural selection. The research finds that selection against black individuals is higher in winter, and against red ones in summer. Factors such as mean maximum summer temperature, mean minimum winter temperature, and local smoke pollution levels influence the intensity of selection. The study concludes that increased mating activity of black individuals may also play a role in some parts of the ladybird's geographical range.
