tldr: The authors investigate the effect of fully coupled poroelasticity on an impulsively loaded crack in plane strain. They provide a formally exact solution for a semi-infinite crack in a linear, isotropic, poroelastic medium and evaluate the stress intensity factor as a function of the Laplace variable. The problem of a finite length crack embedded in a poroelastic medium under uniform impulsively applied tension is also solved using the method of matched asymptotic expansions for small times. The study extends the range of possible solutions of the fully coupled poroelastic equations to mixed boundary-value problems in fracture mechanics, which is fundamental to understanding the interaction between a diffusing pore fluid and the solid elastic skeleton.
