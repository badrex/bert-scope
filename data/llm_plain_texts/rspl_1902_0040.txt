revised_title: The Influence of Carbon Dioxide on Photosynthesis and Plant Growth
semantic_tags:
  - Photosynthesis
  - Carbon dioxide absorption
  - Plant growth

  - Atmospheric carbon dioxide
tldr: This article investigates the relationship between the amount of carbon dioxide in the air and the photosynthetic process of leaves and plant growth. The authors found that a living leaf can absorb varying amounts of carbon dioxide from the surrounding air, which is directly proportional to the partial pressures of the gas. This discovery helps to understand how plants respond to increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and how it affects their growth and photosynthesis.
