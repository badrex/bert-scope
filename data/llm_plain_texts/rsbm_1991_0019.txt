tldr: 'Mary Winifred Parke was a renowned algae researcher who made significant contributions to the field of phycology, mariculture, and biological oceanography. She worked at the University Marine Station at Port Erin and the Plymouth Laboratory of the Marine Biological Association, where she studied the growth, development, and ecology of algae. Her research on marine flagellates led to the discovery of Isochrysis galbana, a successful food organism for rearing larval oysters. Parke's work on seaweed growth and regeneration, as well as her studies on marine flagellates, laid the foundation for future research in seaweed ecology and primary productivity.'
