tldr: The author, Thomas Andrew Knight, investigates the origin and function of alburnum in trees and challenges the common belief that alburnous tubes are responsible for sap ascent. He conducts experiments to demonstrate that the sap likely ascends through the cellular substance of the alburnum, rather than the tubes themselves.
