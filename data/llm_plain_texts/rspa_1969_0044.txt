tldr: The authors investigate the dynamic response of an elastic half-space to time-dependent surface tractions applied over an embedded spherical cavity. They analyze the disturbance due to Rayleigh waves generated during each reflection of body waves at the plane boundary, focusing on the first and third groups of Rayleigh waves. The study provides insights into the behavior of surface waves and their interaction with the cavity, which can be useful for understanding wave propagation in elastic media.
