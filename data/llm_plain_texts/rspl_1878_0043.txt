tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the specific inductive capacity of dielectrics using a new method. They found that their results were lower than previous experiments, possibly due to the specific inductive capacity increasing during the first fraction of a second of electrification. The paper also includes a detailed comparison of the placenta in apes and humans.
