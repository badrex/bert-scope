tldr: This study investigates the role of small lymphocytes in the antibody formation process. The researchers found that small lymphocytes from the thoracic duct can restore the antibody response in irradiated rats, suggesting that these cells are the precursors of antibody-forming cells. The direct and indirect plaque assays were used to demonstrate that small lymphocytes can restore the production of both high and low haemolytic efficiency antibodies against sheep erythrocytes, indicating that antibody heterogeneity is not reflected in a parallel morphological heterogeneity in the cells responsible for the restorative effect.
