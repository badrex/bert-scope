tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the absorption spectrum of Ag I, focusing on single and double excitations involving the 4d subshell. They used synchrotron radiation as the source and improved their experimental technique to achieve higher absorption densities. The study resulted in new observations, revised analysis of transitions, identification of previously undetected series, and the detection of two-electron transitions. The findings provide a better understanding of the energy levels and transitions in Ag I.
