tldr: The article discusses the phenomenon of freezing in expanding non-equilibrium gas flows, specifically focusing on near-frozen quasi-one-dimensional flow in reservoirs. The author presents solutions for various rate processes and analyzes the behavior of the flow in convergent-divergent nozzles. The study also explores the limitations of the near-frozen solution and the importance of considering entropy production in the flow.
