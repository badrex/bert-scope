tldr: This article describes experiments conducted with an invariable pendulum at New South Wales and London by Major-General Sir Thomas Brisbane. The experiments aimed to determine the number of vibrations made by the pendulum in a mean solar day and to measure the effects of gravity, temperature, and location on the pendulum's behavior. The results provided valuable data for understanding the Earth's shape and gravity variations across different locations.
