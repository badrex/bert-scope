tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the two modes of condensation of water vapor on glass surfaces. They discovered that water vapor condenses in two different forms, one being more similar to the liquid state and the other being a unique form that occurs when the glass surface is not completely dry. The author explains that these findings can help understand the process of adsorption and phase transitions of water vapor on surfaces.
