tldr: The author's research led to the conclusion that every muscle fiber is abundantly supplied with nerves, forming a network on the surface of the sarcolemma. Nerves never penetrate the membrane, and they run closely with blood vessels. The author also discovered that nerves and vessels can be stripped off from the muscle fiber, and that the sarcolemma might be composed of capillaries, nerve fibers, and intervening tissue. This study provides important insights into muscle and nerve functions.
