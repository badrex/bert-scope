tldr: The study investigates the distribution of cells of origin of ipsilateral cortico-cortical fibers to area 7 in the parietal lobe of the monkey. The researchers found significant clustering of labeled cells in various cortical areas, with typical bands varying from 500-800 Âµm in width. The intra-area distribution of cortico-cortical projection neurons is comparable to the distribution of neurofibrillary tangles in the cortex in Alzheimer's disease.
