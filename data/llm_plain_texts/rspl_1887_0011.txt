tldr: This study investigates the thermal properties of methyl alcohol, including its expansion, vapor pressure, and compressibility. The authors deduce the densities of the saturated vapor and the heats of vaporization. They find that the apparent critical temperature is 240°C, and the critical pressure is about 59,700 mm.
