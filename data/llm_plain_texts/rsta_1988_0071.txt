tldr: 'This article discusses the importance of understanding the chemistry of the Solar System to determine its origin. The authors explore various aspects of planetary formation, including the role of deuterium enrichment, the evolution of planetary atmospheres, and the link between the compositions of early atmospheres and icy satellite mantles. They emphasize the need for further research to better understand these processes and their implications for planetary formation and evolution.'
