tldr: This lecture by Thomas Young focuses on the mechanism of the eye, particularly the power of the eye to adjust its focus for objects at different distances. Young presents a series of propositions and experiments to understand the eye's structure and functions. He also investigates the role of the crystalline lens in the eye's accommodation and refraction, concluding that changes in the lens's figure are responsible for the eye's ability to focus on objects at varying distances.
