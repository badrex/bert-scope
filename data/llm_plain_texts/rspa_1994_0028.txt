tldr: The author derives new optimal bounds on the effective elastic moduli for orthotropic elastic composites made from two well-ordered isotropic components. The study focuses on finite rank laminates and uses the Hashin-Shtrikman variational principles to obtain optimal bounds on the effective elastic tensors. The results provide insights into microstructures that represent the stiffest or most compliant response for orthotropic composites.
