tldr: The author investigates the disappearance of white blood cells (leucocytes) from the blood after injecting peptone into animals. They find that leucocytes temporarily withdraw into internal organs, as the number of polynuclear leucocytes increases in sections of organs after peptone injection. This study helps to understand the behavior of white blood cells in the body.
