tldr: This article discusses the complexities of planetary evolution and formation, highlighting the importance of compositional gradients and phase transitions in planetary processes. It argues that simple models of planets, which assume homogeneity and a small number of layers, are insufficient to explain the diverse and individualistic nature of planets in the solar system. The article provides examples of real planetary behavior, such as solid-solid phase transitions in terrestrial mantles, volcanic styles and recycling in Venus, heat flows of giant planets, and the role of the Lorentz force in the dynamics of non-metallic portions of giant planets.
