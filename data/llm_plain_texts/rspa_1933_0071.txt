tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments to study the penetrating radiation from thunderclouds using a Geiger-Muller tube counter. They observed two effects caused by distant thunderstorms: a pronounced tendency towards registration of an impulse at the moment a lightning occurs and the registration of more impulses during a time interval before a lightning flash than after. These effects suggest that the radiation from thunderclouds may be related to the process of lightning formation.'
