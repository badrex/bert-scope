tldr: The authors compared the metabolism of energy-rich phosphate compounds in bull semen with anaerobic heat production and impedance change frequency. They found that ATP, ADP, and labile-P decreased during incubation, while AMP and HR increased. The results suggest that factors other than fructolysis may affect anaerobic heat production in bull spermatozoa, and the presence of energy-rich phosphate compounds is essential for sperm activity.
