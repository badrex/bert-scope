tldr: The author presents an analytical approach to classify the Bivalvia using nine anatomical features and a computer analysis of data. The study focuses on the 40 Recent superfamilies of Bivalvia and creates a dendrogram to represent the percentage similarity between superfamilies. The results suggest some changes to the existing classification in the Treatise, and the author emphasizes the importance of using objective methods for future classifications.
