tldr: The authors studied the effect of potential energy surfaces on the dissociation rate constant for fluorine molecules in an argon bath at 3000 K using the Monte Carlo classical trajectory method. They constructed three potential surfaces with varying degrees of anharmonicity and found that the most anharmonic potential yielded the largest rate constant. However, the calculated rate constants were five to six times larger than the experimental values, suggesting that classical mechanics may not accurately describe the system.
