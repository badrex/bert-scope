tldr: 'The author, William Huggins, describes his methods and techniques for photographing the spectra of stars using a Cassegrain telescope and a special spectral apparatus. He discusses the importance of using a slit and Iceland spar prism for better results and explains how to adjust the telescope for precise positioning. Huggins also shares his experience with using dry plates instead of wet collodion for better advantages in photography.'
