tldr: This study examines the retinal currents in frog eyes when exposed to light and electric stimulation. The author, Augustus D. Waller, discovered that the normal eye current gradually declines and can be influenced by light exposure. The response to light changes depending on the state of the retina, which has three stages: fresh, transitional, and stale. The research also explores the effects of tetanisation, massage, and anaesthesia on the eye's response to stimulation.
