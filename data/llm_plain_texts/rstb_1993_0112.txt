tldr: The article discusses the use of three-dimensional general circulation models to study past climates, focusing on the mid-Holocene, the last glacial maximum, and the initiation of the last ice age. The models help determine the changes in atmospheric circulation, frequency of storms, and other parameters not easily derived from field data. The study provides insights into the causes of climate change and highlights the importance of understanding the Earth's orbital parameters and other boundary conditions in climate modeling.
