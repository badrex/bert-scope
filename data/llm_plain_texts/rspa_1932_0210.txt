tldr: The authors re-examined the experimental data on the rate of burning of colloidal propellants and found that the rate of burning is proportional to the pressure of the gases, rather than the density of the gases, as previously concluded by Crow and Grimshaw. They developed a method to analyze pressure-time curves, which helps determine the rate of burning and the nature of the propellant.
