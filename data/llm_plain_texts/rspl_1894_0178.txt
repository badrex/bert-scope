tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the influence of education and age on voluntary muscular movements, specifically focusing on finger movements. They found that the velocity of movements decreases with increasing complexity and that education has a more significant impact on more complex movements like writing. The study also showed that the velocity of finger movements decreases with age, with the most significant impact on writing movements.
