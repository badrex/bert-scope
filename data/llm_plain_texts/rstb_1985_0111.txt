tldr: This article discusses enzyme-catalyzed interesterification processes for modifying oils and fats in the food industry. By exploiting the specificity of lipase catalysts, useful triglyceride mixtures that cannot be obtained through conventional chemical interesterification can be produced. The article also covers the development of interesterification reaction systems, including the use of macroporous particles coated with hydrated lipase as catalysts, and the potential applications of these processes in producing confectionery fats and cocoa butter equivalents.
