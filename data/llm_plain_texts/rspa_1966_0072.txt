tldr: This article presents a theory for the electronic states of mixed molecular crystals, focusing on shallow traps. The authors develop a method to treat the energy states of mixed crystals with impurity molecules differing only by isotopic substitutions from the host molecules. They provide formulae for energy levels and transition moments for dilute crystals and crystals with any concentration of guests arranged in a superlattice. The theory is applied to mixed crystals of naphthalene and deuteronaphthalenes in a following paper.
