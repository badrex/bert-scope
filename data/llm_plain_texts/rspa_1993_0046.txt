tldr: The authors examine the theoretical creep closure of subglacial tunnels cut into basal till, generalizing Nye's classical analysis of tunnel closure in glacier ice to rheologies where the creep rate depends on effective pressure. They find that the closure characteristics of high permeability and low permeability channels are very different, and that the dynamics of this process determine the effective pressure and sliding law for ice over a deformable till.
