tldr: The author presents a theory for the deformation and small free vibrations of a thin elastic shell. The theory considers the equilibrium of an element of the shell and forms the equation of virtual work, leading to differential equations and boundary conditions. The author also discusses the potential energy of deformation and the effects of initial curvature on the shell.
