tldr: This article discusses the interpretation of the ages of the Serenitatis, Imbrium, and Orientale impact events on the Moon using photogeologic data, a suitable cratering model, temperature estimates of impact ejecta, the petrology of lunar breccias, and meaningful radiometric age measurements. The author presents the basis for their interpretation and discusses alternative views regarding the ages of these events, emphasizing the importance of understanding the thermal history of breccias and the distribution of ejecta from lunar basins.
