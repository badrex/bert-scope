tldr: The authors investigate how humans deal with complex, uncertain systems and identify common mistakes that lead to failure. They analyze a simulated scenario of a development project in the Moro region and find that people often fail to clearly define goals, form insufficient hypotheses about the system, neglect long-term effects, and lack self-reflection. These errors can lead to catastrophes in complex action situations.
