tldr: The authors conducted experiments on tin and mercury cylinders to study the magnetization in the intermediate state of superconductors. They found that the magnetization curves deviate from the simple form expected for an infinite cylinder, and the results agree with Landau's theory of the intermediate state. The study also provides estimates of the surface energy at the boundary between normal and superconducting phases at various temperatures.
