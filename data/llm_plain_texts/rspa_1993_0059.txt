tldr: The authors present a rigorous mathematical formulation for the axisymmetric stress-transfer problem of an elastic cylindrical shell embedded in a semi-infinite solid. They use a set of ring-load Green's functions for the shell and a group of fundamental solutions for the half-space to reduce the problem to a pair of Fredholm integral equations. The study provides insights into the mechanical interaction between embedded cylindrical bodies and elastic media, with applications in geotechnical, structural, material, and aerospace engineering.
