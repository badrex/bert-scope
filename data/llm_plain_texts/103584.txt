tldr: The author, Mr. Leeuwenhoek, observed the structure and properties of fat particles using a microscope. He discovered that fat particles have a complex internal structure, with numerous small cells enclosed within a membrane. The author also found that fat particles can change shape and size depending on the conditions, and that they have a unique dent or pinch in them. These observations led him to believe that fat particles may be separated from their membranes without breaking them.
