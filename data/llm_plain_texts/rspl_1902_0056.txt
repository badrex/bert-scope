tldr: The author conducted experiments with mercury vapour and helium gas in a Plucker's tube to study the effect of mercury vapour on the helium spectrum. They discovered that introducing mercury vapour into the tube simplified the spectrum of the negative glow and caused three helium lines to disappear. Additionally, a new orange mercury line appeared, which was not present when other gases were mixed with mercury vapour. This finding suggests that a helium-mercury tube containing a trace of hydrogen could be a valuable standard tube for spectroscopic measurements.
