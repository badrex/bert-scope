tldr: The authors developed a cloud chamber technique to study the freezing of pure liquids, specifically molten alkali halides. They observed critical supercooling in these salts and found that the freezing threshold is close to the melting point. This research provides insights into the behavior of supercooled liquids and the process of freezing.
