tldr: This study investigates the thermal decomposition of nitrogen iodide, focusing on the kinetics, activation energy, and the role of various factors such as pressure, ammonia, and water vapor. The results show that nitrogen iodide decomposes into nitrogen, ammonia, and iodine at low pressures, and the reaction rate is affected by the presence of ammonia and water vapor. The study also discusses the possibility of the reaction occurring throughout the lattice of the solid.
