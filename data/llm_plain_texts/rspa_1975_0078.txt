tldr: The authors conducted a parametric study of isotope shifts in the arc spectrum of xenon, focusing on the even and odd configurations. They obtained the isotope shifts of 30 levels for mass numbers 136, 134, 132, 130, and 128. The study separated mass and field effects on the shifts and found that the specific mass-shifts were larger for most levels. The authors used King diagrams to evaluate the contributions of mass and field effects and compared experimental values with ab initio values obtained through Hartree-Fock non-relativistic and relativistic methods, finding satisfactory agreement.
