tldr: The author, Martin Barry, examines the internal generative organs in rabbits and observes the presence of blood corpuscles in altered states. These corpuscles undergo changes in form and may be involved in the process of blood cell division. The author also discusses the presence of a second form of corpuscles in various animals and their possible connection to the so-called "lymph-granules." The study contributes to the understanding of blood cell morphology and cell biology.
