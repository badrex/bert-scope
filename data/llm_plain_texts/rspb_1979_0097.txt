tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of d- and l-enantiomers of adenosine, AMP, and ADP and their 2-chloro- and 2-azido- analogues on human platelets. They found that the l-enantiomers were completely inactive as aggregators or inhibitors of platelet function, while the d-enantiomers showed high potency. This suggests that the l-enantiomers could be ideal controls for differentiating between specific and non-specific labelling of receptors on platelets.
