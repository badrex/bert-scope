tldr: The author proposes a template model for semivision, a type of vision that occurs in lower animals without conscious visual categorization. The model involves ratios of template responses, which are based on temporal contrast and spatial resolution, to detect and differentiate various features in visual patterns. This approach can be applied to artificial vision systems for improved performance.
