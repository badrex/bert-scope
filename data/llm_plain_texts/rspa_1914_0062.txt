tldr: The authors studied the effects of various substances on the optical rotatory power of fructose solutions. They discovered that different substances, whether weak solutes or strong solutes, alter the equilibrium between fructose's two isodynamic forms, fructodextrose and fructolaevose. The findings provide insight into the complex interactions between fructose and interfering agents, such as salts, alcohols, and other compounds.
