tldr: This article by Professor Cayley discusses the transformation of elliptic functions, focusing on the algebraic and transcendental aspects of the theory. It covers the work of Jacobi, Sohnke, Joubert, and Konigsberger, and explores the cases of n=7 and n=11 in detail. The author presents a clearer understanding of the algebraic question and still finds it necessary to resort to the transcendental theory.
