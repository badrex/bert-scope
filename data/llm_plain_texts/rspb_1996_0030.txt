tldr: This study investigates the relationship between male reproductive reserves and mating systems in butterflies. It shows that males in polyandrous species have higher amounts of nitrogen in their abdomens, suggesting that they are selected for having "high quality" reproductive reserves. The research also demonstrates that material from male ejaculates is incorporated into female soma and eggs, increasing female reproductive output.
