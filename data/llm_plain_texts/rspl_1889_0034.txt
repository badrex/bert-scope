tldr: This article investigates the thermo-electric properties of platinoid, an alloy similar to German silver, and its potential applications in electrical instruments and resistance coils. The author also compares platinoid's thermo-electric position with other metals such as platinum, iron, aluminum, and copper. Platinoid has a high resistance and a low temperature variation of electric resistance, making it suitable for use in various electrical devices.
