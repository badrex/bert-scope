tldr: This study investigates the impact strength of diamond under different strain rates. The researchers found that the maximum stress at fracture increased as the duration of impact decreased. They explained this by suggesting that under impacts of longer duration, fracture occurs through the slow formation of ring and cone cracks, followed by crystallographic fracture. In impacts of short duration, there is no time for these cracks to form, and the diamond breaks through crystallographic fracture directly.
