revised_title: A Generalisation of Weyl's Geometry and its Implications in Physics

tldr: The author presents a generalisation of Weyl's geometry, removing an artificial restriction and simplifying the scheme. This new theory sheds light on the natural gauge system and its role in physics, providing a foundation for further development of physical theory. The author also introduces in-tensors and discusses their properties, which play a crucial role in understanding the structure of the continuum.
