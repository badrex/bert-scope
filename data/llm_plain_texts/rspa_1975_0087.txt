tldr: The authors developed a theory to explain the width of the ferromagnetic resonance line of europium iron garnet. They found that the longitudinal theory, which considers the population redistribution lagging behind the values appropriate to instantaneous equilibrium with the field, can successfully explain the variation in width with temperature, operating frequency, and direction. The relaxation processes responsible for the redistribution are primarily of the 'inter' type, associated with transitions between the states of the ion rather than being internal.
