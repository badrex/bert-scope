tldr: The authors propose a new model that combines the effects of 'bad genes' and 'bad luck' to explain the distribution of extinction sizes. They suggest that species undergo evolution in bursts, making them more susceptible to environmental stresses and leading to higher extinction rates. The model predicts features seen in the fossil record, such as bursts of evolution, power-law distribution of extinction sizes, and precursor and aftershock extinctions.
