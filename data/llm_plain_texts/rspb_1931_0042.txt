tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate the relationship between plant respiration and the exosmosis of electrolytes. They found that the rate of respiration affects the concentration of hydrogen ions, which in turn influences the distribution of electrolytes between plant tissues and the surrounding solution. The study highlights the importance of respiration in maintaining ionic equilibria in plant tissues.
