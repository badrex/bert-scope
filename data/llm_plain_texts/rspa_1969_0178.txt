tldr: The authors studied the radiolysis of triethylamine-3-methylpentane glasses using optical and electron spin resonance spectroscopy. They discovered two distinct bands in the optical spectrum and characterized the decay of these bands at various temperatures. The results provide insights into the behavior of trapped electrons in the glass matrix and the effects of temperature on their decay.
