tldr: This study investigates the effects of altering the acid-base balance in the body through carbon dioxide intake and sodium bicarbonate ingestion on human carbohydrate and oxygen metabolism. The researchers found that increasing the acid-base balance led to changes in blood sugar levels, respiratory quotients, and the appearance of acetone bodies in urine. These findings suggest that acid-base balance plays a crucial role in regulating metabolism and that disturbances in this balance can lead to symptoms similar to diabetes.
