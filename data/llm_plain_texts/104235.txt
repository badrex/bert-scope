tldr: This article describes a case study of a patient with an extraordinary tumour in their knee. The patient's leg was amputated by Mr. Jer. Peirce, and upon examination, the tumour was found to be ossified with bony substances and filled with a mucilaginous liquid. The patient recovered well after the operation, and the article discusses the remarkable resilience of the human body in such cases.
