tldr: 'Thomas Forster reports on the discovery of a new island that emerged from the sea near Tercera. He describes the island as being surrounded by fire and smoke, and the crew experienced a small shower of ashes and pumice stones. The island was likely formed by a volcanic eruption, as evidenced by the presence of pumice stones and half-broiled fish in the surrounding sea.'
