tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the transformation temperature of tin, using a dilatometric technique. They found that the transition temperature between grey and white tin depends on the activity of the specimen and the presence of impurities. Highly active materials have a higher transition temperature due to the high strain energy in the white tin formed. The results suggest that elements which raise the transformation temperature do so by increasing the degree to which strain energy can be retained in the white tin.
