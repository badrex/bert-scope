tldr: In 1770, Nathan Pigott observed the transit of Venus over the Sun from Caen, France. He shared his observations with the Royal Society and discussed the challenges he faced during the observation, such as the undulatory motion of the Sun and the exhalations from a nearby river and meadow. Pigott's observations were compared with those made at other locations, including Kew and Greenwich, to better understand the transit and its implications for celestial mechanics and time measurement.
