tldr: This study investigates secular variations in geomagnetic declination and inclination recorded in lake sediments from east-central North America and the United Kingdom. The authors construct type-curves for these variations and discuss the implications of their findings for understanding the Earth's core and its magnetic field. They also explore the potential of lake sediment records for providing continuous global data on geomagnetic secular variations.
