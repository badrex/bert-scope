tldr: The authors made an absolute determination of the ampere using a current weigher, a physical balance with two coil systems, and made modifications to improve the accuracy of the measurements. They determined the linear dimensions of the coils, the moment of inertia of the moving parts, and the thermal coefficients of linear expansion to minimize errors in the determination of current. The error in the determination of current, arising from want of exact knowledge of the linear dimensions of the coils, does not exceed 1 part in 100,000.
