tldr: 'In this experiment, Mr. Hauksbee demonstrated the proportion of the weight of air to the weight of an equal volume of water. He used a specially designed bottle filled with lead to balance it in water. By pumping out the air and measuring the weight difference, he found that the weight of air is 885 times less than the weight of an equal volume of water. This experiment contributed to the understanding of atmospheric pressure and gas laws.'
