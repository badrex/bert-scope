tldr: The author examines the presence of sulphur in mineral waters, particularly in cold waters, and discusses its effects and health benefits. The author also compares the properties of sulphur-rich waters from England and Ireland to those from Aix la Chapelle and Borsel. The presence of sulphur in various waters is demonstrated through experiments and observations, including the discolouration of metals, the smell, and the precipitation of minerals.
