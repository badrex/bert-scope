tldr: The author discovered that dentinal tubes contain soft fibrils that play a crucial role in the sensitivity of the dentine. These fibrils connect the dentine to the pulp of the tooth, allowing the transmission of sensations such as pain and pressure. The presence of these fibrils helps explain the varying levels of sensitivity in different parts of the tooth and the loss of sensitivity when the pulp is destroyed. The author also observed that the fibrils become consolidated in teeth affected by caries, contributing to the hardness of the affected dentine.
