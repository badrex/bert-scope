tldr: This article discusses the chemical control of stomatal movements in plants, focusing on the role of abscisic acid as an endogenous regulator of stomatal opening. The author explores the use of antitranspirants to improve water efficiency in plants and protect them from water stress. The article also highlights the importance of understanding the mechanisms behind stomatal movements and the potential for studying natural defense mechanisms in plants.
