tldr: This article explores the magnetism of drills and the influence of heat on their polarity. The author, Mr. Ballard, investigates how drills acquire a polarity and whether heat can change their magnetic properties. He also examines the possibility of brass or copper giving a north polarity to a drill. The author's experiments provide insights into the relationship between heat, motion, and magnetism.
