tldr: This article investigates the low-temperature deformation of body-centered cubic metals, focusing on the mechanism of thermally activated flow. The authors discuss the role of dislocation interactions with impurities and lattice interactions in the deformation process. They also evaluate the parameters of the rate equation for dislocation motion and the enthalpy of activation, providing insights into the temperature and stress dependence of the flow stress.
