tldr: The authors apply the method of successive Padé approximants to the high-temperature series for the susceptibility of Heisenberg systems with nearest-neighbor interactions only. They find that the susceptibility of a ferromagnet diverges near the critical temperature with a law, and discuss the susceptibility of an antiferromagnet. The specific heat near the critical point is considered, but the results are inconclusive.
