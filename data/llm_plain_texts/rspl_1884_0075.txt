tldr: The authors studied the structure and rhythm of the heart in fishes, focusing on the eel. They discovered the heart's various parts, including the ventricle, auricle, and sinus, and how they work together. They found that the normal order of contraction in the heart can be reversed, and they discussed the role of the auricle in the heart's function. Their findings can be applied to other fish species as well.
