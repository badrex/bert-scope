tldr: In 1740, James Short and Dr. Bevis observed the occultation of Jupiter and its satellites by the Moon. They used a reflecting telescope and noticed that Jupiter's light appeared dimmer and fainter when close to the Moon. The observations provided insights into the Moon's surface and the behavior of celestial bodies during eclipses.
