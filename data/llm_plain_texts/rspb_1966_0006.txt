tldr: The authors studied the stereochemistry of rubber biosynthesis and farnesyl pyrophosphate formation in latex using stereospecifically labeled mevalonates. They found that the enzyme systems for both farnesyl pyrophosphate and rubber synthesis exhibit complete stereospecificity in proton elimination from isopentenyl pyrophosphate. Rubber is formed with an all-cis configuration without the intervention of trans structures, while farnesol and squalene have a trans double bond. This research sheds light on the mechanisms of cis configuration formation in rubber and the possibility of distinct enzymes responsible for different stereospecific eliminations in polyisoprenoid biosynthesis.
