tldr: This study compiles and interprets data on the intraplate tectonic stress field, focusing on stress orientation and relative magnitudes in the upper crust. The results show that the intraplate stress field is largely compressional, with horizontal stresses greater than the vertical stress. The regionally uniform horizontal stress orientations are consistent with plate-boundary forces and the geometry of the plate boundaries, indicating that plate-driving forces play a critical role in determining the stress field in the interior of the plates.
