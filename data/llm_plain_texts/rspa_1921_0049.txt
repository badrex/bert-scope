tldr: 'The author, R. W. Wood, conducted experiments to measure the time interval between the absorption and emission of light in fluorescence. He discovered that the time interval in the case of mercury vapour was about 1/15,000th of a second, and that the substance remains dark during the period of excitation. This study provided insights into the processes of fluorescence and resonance radiation.'
