tldr: This article explores the concept of Veblen-Wedderburn hybrid planes, a type of non-Desarguesian projective plane. The author describes a method to redistribute the points of collinear sets in a Desarguesian plane to create these hybrid planes. Two types of hybrid planes are discussed: one over a subfield of the real numbers and another over a finite field. The article establishes the existence of these hybrid planes and their properties, including the splitting of points on complex lines and the structure of the group simply-transitive on points of the plane.
