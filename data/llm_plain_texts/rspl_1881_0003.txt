tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the motor roots of the brachial and lumbo-sacral plexuses in monkeys to understand their functional relations. They found that different motor roots control specific muscles and that the sensory roots are distributed to the skin areas overlying the muscles supplied by the corresponding motor roots. This research provides insights into the complex connections between the spinal cord and the muscles, which can be applied to humans as well.
