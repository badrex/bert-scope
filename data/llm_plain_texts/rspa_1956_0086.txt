tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure Townsend's ionization coefficient 'a' and pre-breakdown currents in hydrogen gas. They found that earlier measurements may be in error, and their results support the Townsend theory for explaining the initiation of electrical breakdown in hydrogen up to a pd value of at least 2800 cm mmHg. The study also provides evidence for the secondary coefficient of the Townsend type, which is essential for understanding the breakdown mechanism.
