tldr: This article discusses experiments conducted at the Institute of High-Energy Physics in Serpukhov, USSR, on proton-proton interactions at energies between 10 and 70. The experiments include studies of small angle elastic scattering, total cross-sections, and interactions in a hydrogen bubble chamber. The results indicate that the effective proton radius grows and the forward elastic scattering amplitude becomes almost purely imaginary.
