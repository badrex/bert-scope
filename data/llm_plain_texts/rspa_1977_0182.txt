tldr: This study investigates the absorption spectrum of lead vapor and the interactions between single and double excitation channels in the 5d and 6s spectra of Pb I. The authors found that the double ionization threshold causes quenching of all but one excitation series, confirming the applicability of a'spectator model' for excitation. The study provides insights into the behavior of inner shell spectra and the role of interchannel interactions in the absorption process.
