tldr: The author analyzes the sound generated by low Mach number turbulent flow from an elastic nozzle, focusing on the axisymmetric component of the sound. They find that surface compliance significantly reduces the intensity of the sound generated at the edge at very low frequencies. Additionally, the efficient generation of extensional waves by an edge flow at low frequencies has a profound effect on the production of sound, with the dominant component of the scattered sound radiating within a narrow range of directions determined by the leaky waves excited at the nozzle exit.
