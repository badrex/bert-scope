tldr: This article discusses the use of picosecond Raman techniques to study vibrational dynamics in liquids. The authors explore various experimental methods, such as coherent anti-Stokes and Stokes scattering, incoherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering, and fluorescence probing, to investigate vibrational dephasing processes and gain insights into molecular behavior in liquids.
