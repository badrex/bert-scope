tldr: This article discusses the discovery of fossil arthropods and scorpions in coal formations in Nova Scotia, as well as an anatomical study of the hippocampal region in anosmatic animals like whales and seals. The author examines the differences in the brains of these animals and how it relates to their lack of sense of smell. The study also suggests a revision of the nomenclature of the hippocampal region.
