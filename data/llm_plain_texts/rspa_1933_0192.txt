tldr: The authors conducted a series of dielectric loss measurements on liquid hydrocarbon derivatives, such as benzene, toluene, chlorbenzene, and nitrobenzene, over a frequency range of 2 X 10^5 to 2 X 10^6 cycles per second. They studied the effects of prolonged steady voltage application on the power loss exhibited by these liquid dielectrics in alternating electric fields. The authors found that the leakage resistance in nitrobenzene increased after the application of direct current voltage, which affected the dielectric loss resistance. They also investigated the effect of temperature on dielectric loss and discovered that the leakage resistance in the condenser used as Cx had a measurable increase above 50Â°C.
