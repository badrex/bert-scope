tldr: This study provides an ecological account of tide pools on the Atlantic coast at Carrigathorna and a sheltered slate reef nearby, both located at the entrance to Lough In, County Cork. The authors chart the pools, measure their levels and dimensions, and document the physical environment, including water temperature, dissolved oxygen, hydrogen ion concentration, and salinity. They identify five ecological facies in the tide pools and discuss the distribution of flora and fauna in relation to environmental conditions. The research aims to provide a basis for future comparisons in case of climatic or environmental changes.
