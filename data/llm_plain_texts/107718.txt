tldr: The author compares barometrical and trigonometrical methods to determine the height of a hill at Spitzbergen. They use a barometer made by Mr. Jones and a mountain barometer made by Mr. Newman to measure the height. The author also discusses the challenges they faced during the measurements and the corrections needed for the barometers. The trigonometrical method involved using a repeating circle and calculating the angles to determine the height of the hill.
