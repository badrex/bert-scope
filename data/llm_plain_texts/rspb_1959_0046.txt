tldr: This article examines the myotome structure of acanthodians, a group of more primitive craniate gnathostome vertebrates. The author discovers that unlike fish, acanthodians do not have a horizontal septum dividing their myotomes. This finding reinforces the idea that acanthodians are a distinct group and not part of the fish family, suggesting that fish evolved from even more primitive forms.
