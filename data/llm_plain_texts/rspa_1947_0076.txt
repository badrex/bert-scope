tldr: This study examines lunar tidal variations in the ionosphere, specifically in the F region near the magnetic equator. The research focuses on data from the Huancayo ionospheric observatory in Peru, which shows that the lunar variation in the F region depends on solar time in both phase and amplitude. The findings suggest that the lunar atmospheric oscillation may have notable changes with height, and the variations are different from those at other sites being analyzed.
