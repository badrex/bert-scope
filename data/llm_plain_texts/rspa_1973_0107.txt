tldr: The authors investigate the theoretical background of donor-acceptor radiative and Auger recombination in simple direct semiconductors with parabolic bands and a random distribution of impurity centers. They obtain formulae for donor-acceptor Auger recombination rates and study their dependence on donor-acceptor separation. The results confirm that the Auger effect will be significant in GaAs and similar materials only for carrier concentrations greater than or of the order of 2.
