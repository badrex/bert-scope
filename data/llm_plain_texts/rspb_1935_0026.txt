tldr: The author investigates the controlling factors of photosynthesis, including temperature, light intensity, and carbon dioxide concentration. They propose a formula to calculate the rate of photosynthesis when a photostationary state is established. The study shows that the rate of photosynthesis is directly proportional to light intensity and inversely proportional to temperature, providing insights into the efficiency of photosynthesis in living plants.
