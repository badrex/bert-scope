tldr: The authors describe a method of graphical representation to study the behavior of ternary alloys and the equilibrium in fusion. They explain how to use a triangle to represent the three liquids and how to analyze the compositions of the resulting alloys. The graphical representation helps to understand the critical curve and the system of lines, which show the complete result of the experiments. The authors also discuss the difference between associated and conjugate alloys and suggest ways to obtain truly conjugate alloys.
