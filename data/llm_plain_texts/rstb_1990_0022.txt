tldr: The article discusses the structure and function of the Lac permease protein in Escherichia coli, which is responsible for the translocation of lactose and protons across the cell membrane. The protein's secondary structure is analyzed, and the role of specific amino acid residues in lactose transport is investigated using site-directed mutagenesis. The findings suggest that Arg302, His322, and Glu325 may be involved in lactose-coupled proton translocation, possibly through a charge-relay mechanism.
