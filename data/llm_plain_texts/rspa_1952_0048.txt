tldr: The authors studied the effects of X-rays on ferrous and ferric salts in aqueous solutions. They found that the specific rate constant of the reaction between OH radicals and ferrous ions is about five times greater than that of the corresponding reaction with hydrogen molecules. The study led to the assumption that molecular hydrogen ions intervene in the process and that these ions exist in equilibrium. The energy required for the production of a radical pair by the action of X-rays on water was estimated.
