tldr: The authors conducted an experimental study of the boundary layer beneath a Rankine-like vortex using a laser-Doppler anemometer. They investigated the three-dimensional boundary layer when a Rankine-like vortex is bounded by a fixed plane boundary, such as a horizontal disc. The study found that the boundary layer was laminar at lower Reynolds numbers and transitioned to a turbulent state at higher numbers, with the radial pressure gradient having a stabilizing effect on the boundary layer.
