tldr: The study investigates the role of excitatory amino acid receptors, specifically NMDA and non-NMDA receptors, in synaptic transmission in the CA1 area of the rat hippocampus. The researchers used the antagonist CNQX to block non-NMDA responses and found that both NMDA and non-NMDA receptors can mediate synaptic excitation of pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons under different circumstances.
