tldr: This article discusses the theoretical methods used to study hydrogen interactions in semiconductors, focusing on the electrical characteristics and various effects of hydrogen on semiconductor properties. The author describes different approaches to studying defects in semiconductors, such as cluster and supercell methods, and discusses the main findings related to hydrogen's passivation of shallow impurities, interstitial hydrogen, and anharmonic effects on hydrogen's behavior in semiconductors.
