tldr: The authors conducted a study on the occurrence of heterotypical mitoses in cancer cells. They discovered that these mitoses were not the result of a reduction in chromosome numbers, but rather were due to variations in the development of the achromatic figure, chromosome form, and their attachment to the spindle. The authors also found that some nuclear divisions resembling heterotypical mitoses were caused by chromosomes being split longitudinally and adhering for some time after separation, leading to a deceptive appearance of reduced chromosome numbers.
