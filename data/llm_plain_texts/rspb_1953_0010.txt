semantic_tags:
  - Protein Structure
  - Fibrous Proteins
  - X-ray Crystallography
  - Protein Configurations
  - Protein Densities
tldr: This article discusses the structure and configurations of proteins, focusing on fibrous proteins and their synthetic analogues. It explores the dimensional features and properties of various protein structures, such as a- and b-keratin, and examines the role of X-ray crystallography in understanding protein structure. The article also highlights the importance of considering the density and arrangement of proteins in their natural state.
