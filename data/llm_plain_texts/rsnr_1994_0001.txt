tldr: This article examines the mathematical competence of Samuel and Elizabeth Pepys, based on a fictitious diary attributed to Elizabeth. It challenges the negative portrayal of Samuel's arithmetic abilities and highlights Elizabeth's alleged competence. The authors argue that, despite lacking formal education in mathematics, Samuel was a competent administrator and learned arithmetic to manage the Navy's accounts. Elizabeth, on the other hand, was not as proficient as she was portrayed, and her claim to teach Samuel was an overstatement. The article provides insights into the historical context of mathematics education and the role of the Royal Society.
