tldr: The author investigates the molecular anisotropy of urea, CO(NH2)2, and related compounds. They study the magnetic anisotropy of urea and compare it with the carbonate and nitrate groups, finding that the anisotropy indicates a similar degree of resonance in all three groups. The author also examines the optical anisotropy of urea and the crystal structures of urea nitrate, urea oxalate, cyanuric acid dihydrate, and anhydrous cyanuric acid, which all have layer structures. The study provides insights into the molecular structure and properties of these compounds.
