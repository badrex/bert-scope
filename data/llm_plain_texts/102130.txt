tldr: The author, Dr. Tancred Robinson, describes his observations of boiling fountains and subterranean steams in various locations, including near Peroul, Italy, and in the Duke of Modena's territories. He discusses the different types of exhalations and effluvia found in these locations, such as cold and dry air, inflammable and bituminous vapors, and hot, sulfurous, and saline steams. He also explores the role of sulfur and pyrites in these phenomena and the potential for other minerals and metals to be involved in underground processes.
