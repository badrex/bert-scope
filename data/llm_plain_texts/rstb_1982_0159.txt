tldr: The article discusses a Ciba Foundation meeting on protein and membrane interactions, focusing on the role of glycoproteins in cell membrane synthesis and pseudopodial reactions. The authors explore the association between serum spreading factors and filopodia, as well as the potential role of viral surface components in these interactions. The study also examines the structural and functional dissection of the Golgi complex and the movement of viral proteins through the cell.
