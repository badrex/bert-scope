tldr: This article extends the de Saint-Venant solution to cases where the cross-section of a cantilever has only one axis of symmetry. The authors apply this solution to a "trough" or "gutter-pipe" section, represented mathematically by a curtate circular annulus loaded in its plane of symmetry. They compare the influence of different fixing conditions on the deflection of the cantilever and provide a method for measuring deflection in experimental work.
