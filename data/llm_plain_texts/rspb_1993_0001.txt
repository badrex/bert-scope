tldr: 'The article explores a continuous predator-prey model with both species diffusing along a spatial gradient, demonstrating that it exhibits temporal chaos at a fixed point in space. The model incorporates a nonlinear functional response of the predator and a logistic growth of the prey, with the intrinsic growth rate of the prey varying linearly with space. The results suggest that complex temporal dynamics in natural communities may arise through the spatial dimension, and spatially induced chaos may play a significant role in spatial pattern generation in heterogeneous environments.'
