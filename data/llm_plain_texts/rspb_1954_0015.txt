tldr: The author discusses the limitations of current methods for determining enzyme localization in cells and proposes a new approach using indoxyl compounds. This method involves the oxidation of indoxyl compounds to indigoid dyes, which can help visualize enzymatic activity in cells. The author also highlights the challenges and requirements for designing suitable chromogenic substrates for this approach.
