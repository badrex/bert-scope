tldr: The author investigates the astronomical observations and alignments in British stone circles, particularly focusing on the use of stars for timekeeping and marking important solar events. The study reveals that ancient British astronomer-priests used specific stars, such as Arcturus and Capella, to help determine the time and mark the rising and setting of the sun during key festivals. The findings provide insight into the ancient practices and beliefs of the people who built these monuments.
