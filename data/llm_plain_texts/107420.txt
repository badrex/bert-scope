tldr: The author discusses the concept of chemical equivalents and the importance of understanding the relative weights of elements in chemical reactions. They propose using a determinate quantity of carbonate of lime as a measure for comparing the powers of acids and alkalies. The author also explores the law of multiple proportions and its application in determining the atomic theory and chemical bonding.
