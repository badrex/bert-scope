tldr: The author discusses the incorrect assumption that sounds produced by certain fishes were caused by the expulsion of air through the ductus pneumaticus. They now believe that the sounds are caused by the vibration of the air within the air-bladder, which is set in motion by the "elastic spring" apparatus or extrinsic muscles. The author also mentions Dr. Sorensen's research on the subject and expresses regret for any unintentional injustice done to him.
