tldr: This article explores how sublithospheric loading, associated with regions of anomalous density in the mantle, produces tectonic stress in the upper lithosphere. The author explains how this stress system can lead to plate-boundary forces, such as ridge push, slab pull, and trench suction. The study uses elastic-viscoelastic finite-element modeling to analyze the effects of sublithospheric loading and associated flexural topography.
