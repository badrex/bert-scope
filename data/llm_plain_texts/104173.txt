tldr: This article presents a detailed calculation of the transit of Mercury over the Sun on October 25, 1743, by John Catlyn. The author uses equations and observations from previous years to predict the time and duration of the transit, taking into account the positions of the Sun and Mercury, as well as the distance between their centers. The article also compares this transit to a similar one that occurred in 1697.
