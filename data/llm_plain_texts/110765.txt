tldr: The author, Robert Lee, examines the anatomy and physiology of the decidua, a membrane in the uterus. He observes that the maternal blood circulation in the ovum during early gestation is mainly carried out by the layers of this membrane and the chorion cells. Lee believes that the veins of the uterine decidua transport blood from the decidua cavity into the uterus veins, and maternal blood likely flows constantly from chorion cells through the decidua reflexa into the decidua cavity.
