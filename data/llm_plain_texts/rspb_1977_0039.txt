tldr: The study investigates the eye of the diurnal moth Phalaenoides tristifica, revealing a sharply focused superposition eye with high resolution. The compound eye has a superposition image, with 120-150 facets contributing to the focused image. The moth's eye is adapted for extreme sensitivity and possibly good resolution, allowing it to see small contrast differences in small objects.
