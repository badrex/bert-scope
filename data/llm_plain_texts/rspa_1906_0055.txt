tldr: This study investigates the physical constants of ammonia, focusing on the effects of temperature and pressure on its density. The authors conducted experiments to determine the density at various temperatures and pressures, and used these data to calculate the coefficient of expansion and compressibility of ammonia. They also examined the adsorption of ammonia by glass, condensation on the glass surface, loss of ammonia during the experiment, and the displacement of air due to changes in the volume of the sulfuric acid.
