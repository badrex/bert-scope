tldr: The author conducted experiments with seeds to study the direction of radicle and germen during germination. They found that the radicle always descends towards the center of the earth, while the germen ascends in the opposite direction. The author concluded that gravitation is the main factor influencing this behavior, as it attracts the sap to the underside of the germen and causes the elongation of its fibers and vessels. This discovery helps explain how plants grow and adapt to their environment.
