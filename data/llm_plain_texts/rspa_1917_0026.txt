tldr: The authors investigate the process of demagnetization and the role of the Earth's magnetic field in residual magnetism. They develop a magnetic shield capable of reducing the internal field caused by the Earth to a level of 10^-3 C.G.S. unit. The study also reveals that the permanent magnetism of a mass of iron can only be removed when all steady fields, including the Earth's field, are absent.
