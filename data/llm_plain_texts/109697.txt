tldr: Humphry Davy discusses errors in the process of electrization of ammonia and the decomposition of nitrogen. He compares his results with Dr. Henry's and suggests that Dr. Henry's estimate may not be accurate. Davy also doubts the likelihood of Dr. Henry's attempt to prove the existence of oxygen in ammonia through the formation of water.
