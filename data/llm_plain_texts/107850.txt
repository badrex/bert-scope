tldr: The author, Thomas Andrew Knight, observes the behavior of bees and their reproductive habits. He discovers that bees know their future hive location and that unions between swarms are planned. Knight also discusses the role of the queen bee and the process of cross-breeding in bee colonies. Additionally, he explores the influence of external factors on the sex of offspring in various species, including bees.
