tldr: This article discusses the central role of transcription in molecular biology and how transcription factors regulate gene expression in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The authors describe a meeting where experts discussed the basal transcriptional apparatus, activation and repression of transcription, and the mechanisms of gene regulation in response to stimuli and in specific cell types.
