tldr: The authors studied the vibrational spectra of solid crystalline borofluorides of ammonium, potassium, and sodium. They assigned the observed bands to vibrational frequencies of the boron-fluorine ions and discussed the splitting of these bands due to isotopic species and the influence of the crystal field. The results provide insights into the structure and bonding of borofluorides.
