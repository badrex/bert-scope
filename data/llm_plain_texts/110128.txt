tldr: The author examines the organs of generation in freshwater mussels and discovers seed pearls in the ovarium. He observes that all Oriental pearls have a central cell, which is similar to an ovum. Sir Everard concludes that a pearl forms on the external surface of a blighted ovum, which remains attached to its pedicle in the ovarium. Pearls can be spherical or pyramidal due to the pedicle and ovum being coated in nacre.
