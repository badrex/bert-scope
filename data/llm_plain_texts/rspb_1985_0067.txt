tldr: The article investigates the electrical properties of the spine-triad arrangement in the cat's lateral geniculate nucleus. The authors found that this circuit could be the site of a localized AND-NOT type of veto operation, functionally equivalent to presynaptic inhibition. The geniculate interneuron, which contributes the inhibitory synapse to the spine-triad circuit, controls the flow of visual information into the system. This hypothesis helps explain various effects of inhibition in geniculate and relay cells, enhancing center-surround antagonism and possibly mediating reciprocal lateral inhibition and eye-movement-related suppression.
