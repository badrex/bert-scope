tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the variations in X-ray radiation energy and found that the light quantum hypothesis can explain these variations. The mean ionization is subject to random variations that follow the Gauss law of errors, and the magnitude of an energy quantum is determined by the equation (AQ)²/ Q = 0.83 × 10⁻¹⁶ Coulombs. This supports the validity of Planck's constant and the light quantum hypothesis.
