tldr: This paper discusses the rectification and quadrature of the spherical ellipse, reducing it to the calculation of complete elliptic functions. The author establishes a relation between the area of a spherical ellipse and the length of the spherical ellipse generated by the intersection of a supplemental cone with the same sphere. The paper also explores properties of the spherical ellipse and its analogy to plane curves, as well as the quadrature of the surface of a cone of the second degree.
