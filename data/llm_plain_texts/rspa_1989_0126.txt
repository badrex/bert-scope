tldr: The author presents a modified Bleistein procedure to construct a uniform asymptotic expansion of a contour integral with a saddle point, a pole, and a branch point. The expansion remains valid as the critical points approach each other or coalesce, and it can be simplified for specific cases. The integral is interpreted as describing three different waves associated with the critical points.
