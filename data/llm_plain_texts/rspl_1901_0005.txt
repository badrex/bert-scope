tldr: The authors conducted a chemical study of the phosphoric acid and potash contents in the wheat soils of Broadbalk Field, Rothamsted. They found that citric acid soluble phosphoric acid and potash were good indicators of soil fertility. The study showed that phosphoric acid and potash from manure and chemical fertilizers were mostly accumulated in the surface soil, while some descended into the subsoil. The results also indicated that the presence of potassium, sodium, and magnesium salts helped retain phosphoric acid and potash in a more available form.
