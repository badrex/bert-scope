tldr: The article presents a method for solving the problem of slow flow of a Newtonian viscous glacier slipping over a rough bed, considering the case where cavities form when the water film pressure reaches the local subglacial drainage system pressure. The study reformulates Nye's theory as a Hilbert problem and provides a solution for a periodic bedrock with one cavity per period. The results show that the basal stress has a maximum for a finite basal velocity and decreases towards zero as the velocity tends to infinity.
