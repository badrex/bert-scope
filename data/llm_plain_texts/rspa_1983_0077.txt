tldr: This article develops and clarifies the theory of periodic boundary conditions for simulating the statistical mechanics of dipolar particles. It presents a new fluctuation formula for anisotropic systems and extends the perturbation theory to account for anisotropic long-ranged terms. The article demonstrates the accuracy of these theories with Monte Carlo simulations of the Stockmayer system, showing that periodic boundary conditions should be used with an infinite external dielectric constant in most cases.
