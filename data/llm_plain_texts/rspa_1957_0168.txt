tldr: This article discusses the phenomenon of work-hardening and fatigue in metals, focusing on slip-band damage and extrusion. The author examines the process of reverse slip, which causes slip-band ridges and grooves on the surface of fatigued materials. They also explore the role of localized softening processes, such as recrystallization and aging, in the formation of slip bands. The author investigates the extrusion process in various materials, including aluminum-copper alloys, silver chloride, and aluminum-zinc-magnesium-copper alloys, and discusses the mechanisms behind the metallographic changes caused by fatigue stress.
