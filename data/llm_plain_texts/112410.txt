tldr: The author, A. Matthiessen, conducted research on the chemical composition of narcotine and its products of decomposition. They discovered two new bases derived from narcotine and studied their reactions with hydriodic and hydrochloric acids. The bases, normal narcotine (nornarcotine) and dimethyl-normal-narcotine (dimethyl-nor-narcotine), showed no significant physiological effects. The study provides insights into the chemical properties and reactions of these alkaloids.
