tldr: This article discusses the use of induced gene and chromosome mutants in plant breeding and research to create new cultivars and improve existing ones. The author explains how induced mutations can extend genetic variability and generate a wide range of genetic variation for plant traits. The article also highlights the importance of induced mutants in understanding plant processes and their genetic control, as well as the potential of induced mutations to uncover new loci and alleles for various plant phenotypes.
