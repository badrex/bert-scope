tldr: This study investigates the fluctuations in bacterial numbers and nitrate content in field soils. The authors found significant fluctuations in bacterial numbers and nitrate content at short intervals, with increased bacterial and protozoal numbers in spring and autumn. These findings highlight the importance of understanding soil microbial dynamics for agricultural practices and environmental management.
