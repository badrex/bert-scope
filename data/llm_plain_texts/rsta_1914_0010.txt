tldr: The author presents a method to measure the pressure produced in the detonation of high explosives or by the impact of bullets. The method involves using a steel rod and measuring the momentum transferred by the impact. The pressure-time curve is obtained, which helps determine the maximum pressure and the duration of the impact. This method can be used to study the effects of different types of bullets and explosives.
