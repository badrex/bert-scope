revised_title: 'Fermi-Dirac Functions of Integral Order: Applications and Evaluation'
semantic_tags:
  - Fermi-Dirac functions
  - Integral order
  - Transport effects
  - Band forms
  - Riemann zeta functions
tldr: The article discusses the evaluation and applications of Fermi-Dirac functions of integral order in various physical problems, such as transport effects and band forms in metals and semiconductors. It presents methods for evaluating these functions, including a convergent series and a relation between the functions and their polynomial approximations. The article also provides tables of values for the functions and their applications in different scenarios.
