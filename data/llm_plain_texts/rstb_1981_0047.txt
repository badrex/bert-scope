tldr: This article discusses the manipulation of genetic systems in plant breeding, focusing on the control of recombination. It explores various methods to limit or increase recombination, such as haploid breeding and cytogenetic techniques. The article also highlights the importance of controlling recombination in wheat breeding and the potential for transferring alien genetic variation to wheat through induced homoeologous recombination.
