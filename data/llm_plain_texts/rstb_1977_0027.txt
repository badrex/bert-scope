tldr: The study investigates the ultrastructure and function of antennal sensilla in Acetes shrimps. It describes the morphology of the antenna and the ultrastructure of five types of antennal setae. The authors discuss the setal function and arrangement in relation to the behavior and ecology of sergestids. The study provides insights into the sensory capabilities of a planktonic animal.
