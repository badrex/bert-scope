tldr: This article discusses the understanding of nuclear structure based on the known two-body interaction. It explores the role of isospin in nuclear properties and the complexity of nuclear forces compared to the Coulomb force. The article also reviews the methods used to calculate nuclear properties from these forces and the challenges in understanding the off-shell behavior of the potential.
