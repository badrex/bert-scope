tldr: The authors investigated the magnetic susceptibility of alkali metals, including sodium, potassium, rubidium, and cesium. They found that the metals' magnetic properties differ in the solid state, with some having a positive susceptibility and others negative. The results suggest that the magnetic properties of elements in the periodic system may vary based on their crystal structure and atomic properties.
