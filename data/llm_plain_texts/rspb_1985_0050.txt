tldr: This study investigates the effects of acetylcholine (ACh) on snail neurons. ACh causes different responses in two types of neurons: depolarizing inward currents in D-cells and hyperpolarizing currents in H-cells. Both types of cells show an influx of calcium ions when exposed to ACh, suggesting that ACh increases membrane permeability to calcium in both D- and H-cells.
