tldr: The author, M. Pierre Beron, explains the elements of terrestrial magnetism and attributes its variations to the action of thermo-electric currents. He divides the earth's magnetic systems into four regions - American, Asiatic, Australian, and Gallipagos - and connects the thermo-electric currents to observed magnetic phenomena. Changes in the direction of the magnetic needle are attributed to changes in the distribution of solar heat, which affect the thermo-electric currents. The secular variation in magnetism is linked to the improvement of climate due to the cultivation of the soil in different regions.
