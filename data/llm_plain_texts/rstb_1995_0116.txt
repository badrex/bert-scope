tldr: The article discusses the role of exploratory mechanisms in the evolution of eukaryotic cellular processes. It highlights how dynamic instability of microtubules, neuronal growth, and immune system responses use variation and selection to generate specific patterns. These robust processes can adapt to changes in the environment and ontogenic changes in organisms, suggesting they have been selected for their ability to survive rapid changes and generate cellular variation.
