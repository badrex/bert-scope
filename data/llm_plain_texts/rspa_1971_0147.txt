tldr: This study investigates the interaction between radiation damage and coherent precipitates in copper alloys. The experiments involve varying precipitate size distribution, fast neutron dose, and mismatch of the precipitate. The results show that when the integrated dose and mean precipitate size are large, coherency loss occurs during irradiation or subsequent room temperature annealing. The study also demonstrates that electron irradiation in a high voltage electron microscope can cause coherency loss.
