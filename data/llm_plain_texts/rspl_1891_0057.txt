tldr: This study investigates the origin of sympathetic fibers in the spinal cord and their effects on various bodily functions. The author found that sympathetic fibers in cats, dogs, and rabbits arise from different thoracic nerves and have varying effects on the pupil, nictitating membrane, vaso-motor activity, and sub-maxillary gland secretion. The study also discusses the presence of white and grey rami communicantes and their relation to efferent and afferent fibers in the spinal cord.
