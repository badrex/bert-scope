tldr: The study examines the fluctuating asymmetry in gorilla canines to measure the impact of environmental stress on the species. The research finds that male gorilla canines have higher levels of asymmetry and are positively correlated with the year of collection, indicating that sexually selected structures are more sensitive to environmental stress than non-sexually selected traits.
