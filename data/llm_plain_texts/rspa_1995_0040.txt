tldr: The authors study the normal incidence polar Kerr effect in inhomogeneous multilayers, considering periodic and non-periodic structures with varying refractive indices. They develop a new algorithm to find the state of polarization, Kerr angle, and ellipticity, and provide an exact analytical solution for a semi-infinite medium. This research is important for understanding the behavior of magnetic multilayers and their applications in recording media and ellipsometry.
