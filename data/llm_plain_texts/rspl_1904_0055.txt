tldr: The author investigates the changes in thermoelectric power and strains in metals due to magnetization. They find that the changes in thermoelectric power and length of iron and nickel are related to the magnetizing force. The results show that the thermoelectric and elongation curves for iron and nickel are influenced by the physical condition of the metal, and the direction of the thermoelectric force is different for each metal.
