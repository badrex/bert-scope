tldr: This article presents a theory for the transient lift of three-dimensional purely supersonic wings, extending previous work on two-dimensional wings. The authors find that a simple function of two variables can express all pressure distributions for this and related problems. Charts are provided for the unsteady lift of wings with plan forms made up of straight lines, particularly delta wings. The study concludes that wings with small aspect ratios are most advantageous for gust-loading due to their greater chord-length for a given area.
