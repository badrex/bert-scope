tldr: The authors studied the mutarotation of aluminium benzoylcamphor, a chemical reaction where the compound undergoes a change in its sugar configuration. They found that the reaction is much more complex than the beryllium derivative and cannot be explained by a simple unimolecular law. The reaction appears to involve two parallel unimolecular reactions with different velocities, forming independent pairs of interconvertible isomers. The authors also investigated the effect of temperature and solvents on the reaction, discovering that the form of the mutarotation curves is influenced by the presence of catalysts and solvents like carbon tetrachloride and chloroform.
