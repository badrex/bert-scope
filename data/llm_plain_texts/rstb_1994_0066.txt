tldr: The study investigates the order in which common traits are assembled in ecological analogues, using sand-dwelling lizards as examples. The research applies cladistic methods of phylogeny reconstruction to determine if two or more stocks have responded similarly to similar environments. The findings reveal that the order of trait assembly varies among different lizard lineages, with factors such as accident, contingency, and previous history influencing the evolution process.
