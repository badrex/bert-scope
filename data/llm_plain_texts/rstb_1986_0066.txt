semantic_tags:
  - Gene expression

  - Transcriptional regulation
  - Molecular biology
tldr: This article discusses the regulation of plant growth and development through differential gene expression, specifically focusing on phytochrome and its gene expression. The authors study the structural properties of the photoreceptor molecule and how it regulates the expression of its own genes. They also analyze the transcriptional regulation of phytochrome genes and the role of post-transcriptional events in controlling gene expression.
