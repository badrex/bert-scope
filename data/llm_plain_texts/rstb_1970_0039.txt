tldr: The article discusses the discovery of Late Pleistocene plant beds in a gravel pit at Earith, Huntingdonshire. The plant beds, dating back 42,000 years, provide insight into the climate and vegetation of the time. The area experienced a severely cold climate with permafrost, and the plant mixtures indicate a landscape with open habitats and warm summers with very cold winters. The findings contribute to our understanding of the Weichselian period and the effects of climate change on plant life.
