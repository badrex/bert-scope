tldr: The article discusses the biosynthesis of porphyrins, chlorophyll, and vitamin B, focusing on the neo-series, which are stereoisomers of the normal compounds. The neo-series compounds are formed through epimerization at specific carbon centers in the corrinoid system. The author reviews the chemical properties and equilibration of the neo-series, providing insights into the stereochemistry and biosynthesis of these compounds.
