tldr: The authors studied the magnetic and spectroscopic properties of rare-earth double nitrates and related them to the six parameters defining the crystalline electric field at the rare-earth ion. They found that most experimental results could be fitted to values of the parameters that varied systematically along the rare-earth series. This research provided insights into the crystal field parameters and their importance in understanding the properties of rare-earth salts.
