tldr: This study investigates the relationship between adaptation of suppression, signal enhancement, and masker enhancement in auditory perception. The authors found that adaptation of psychophysical two-tone suppression cannot account for auditory enhancement or enhanced forward masking. The results challenge the hypothesis of adaptation of suppression as the mechanism responsible for signal enhancement and masker enhancement in simultaneous masking and forward masking experiments.
