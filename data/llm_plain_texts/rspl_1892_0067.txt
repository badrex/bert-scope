tldr: The author, Lord Armstrong, developed a multiple induction machine to produce high tension electricity and improve upon the Ruhmkorff coil. By using multiple coils and contact breakers, the machine could deliver more electric energy and overcome the limitations of large coils. The machine was useful for experimental investigations and could create symmetrical figures using Geissler tubes.
