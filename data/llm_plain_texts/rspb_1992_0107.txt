tldr: The article investigates the effects of synapse formation on calcium currents and neurite outgrowth in cultured leech neurons. The results show that synapse formation causes a reduction in calcium currents in postsynaptic cells and affects neurite outgrowth, suggesting a role for calcium entry in promoting neurite outgrowth.
