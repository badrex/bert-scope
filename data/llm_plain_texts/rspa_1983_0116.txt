tldr: The authors argue that the normal ordered energy-momentum operator is the only meaningful geometrical measure of the energy-momentum of states in a free quantum field theory in a general curved space-time. They contrast this with the conventional renormalized expectation values and argue that the use of renormalization theory is not suitable in this context. The paper discusses the definition and properties of the energy-momentum operator and the geometrical vacuum state in curved space-times.
