tldr: 'The author, William Andre, examines the eye structure of the Monoculus Polyphemus, or King Crab, and discovers that its eyes are made up of numerous small, transparent, amber-colored cones. The large eyes have many cones, while the small eyes have only one. The cones' arrangement allows them to receive and transmit light to the organ of sight. This study provides insight into the unique vision capabilities of crustaceans and the complexity of their eye structures.'
