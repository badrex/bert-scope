tldr: The author presents a series of hydrostatical paradoxes and experiments conducted by Robert Boyle, which demonstrate various principles of fluid mechanics, such as the pressure exerted by fluids and the buoyancy of objects. These findings have implications for understanding the human body's anatomy and physiology, as well as practical applications in fields like navigation and medicine.
