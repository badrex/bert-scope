tldr: Edward Foyle Collingwood was a talented mathematician and naval scientist who made significant contributions to both fields. Born into a family with a rich history, he attended Osborne and Dartmouth before joining the Navy. After an injury, he pursued mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was influenced by G. H. Hardy. Collingwood's mathematical work remained outside the knowledge of his family, and he struggled with examinations but excelled in research. He spent time at Aberystwyth, translating lectures on integral functions, and later obtained a Rayleigh Prize for his essay on the formal factorization of an integral function. Though he did not receive a Trinity Research Fellowship, his career in naval science and mathematics flourished, and he became a respected figure in both fields.
