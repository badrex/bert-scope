tldr: The author investigates hydrodynamical problems in idealized Pitot's tubes, which are used to measure fluid velocities. The study involves replacing the circular tube with a two-dimensional channel between parallel plane walls and analyzing the flow of fluid within it. The author presents solutions to the problems and discusses the behavior of the fluid, streamlines, and pressure in the channel.
