revised_title: 'Wave Mechanics and the Dual Aspect of Matter and Radiation: A Bridge Between Two Fundamental Entities'

tldr: The author explores the dual aspect of matter and radiation, proposing a principle of'reciprocal duality' to bridge the gap between these two fundamental entities in physical science. They discuss the wave mechanics of de Broglie and Schrodinger, and how it can be used to view matter and radiation as different aspects of the same phenomenon. The author also suggests that the wave theory of mechanics can lead to a new understanding of the electron as a wave disturbance that travels as a compact group through space.
