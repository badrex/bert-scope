tldr: The authors used the randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) assay to study the genetic variation and population structure of the freshwater bryozoan, Cristatella mucedo. They found that clonal population structure was evident, with one dominant clone at each site. The study demonstrates the usefulness of the RAPD technique in examining population structure and geographic variation in clonal taxa.
