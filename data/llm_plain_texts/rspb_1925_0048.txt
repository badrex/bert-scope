tldr: The authors conducted a study on the relationship between pulse rate and oxygen intake during the early stages of recovery from severe exercise. They found that the oxygen intake decreases more rapidly than the pulse rate, suggesting that the heart's output per beat is reduced after exercise. This indicates that the body's need for oxygen is not met immediately after exercise, and the authors propose that the output of the heart per beat is diminished due to the sudden stoppage of bodily movements that aid in venous return.
