tldr: 'In this article, Tiberius Cavallo describes new experiments in electricity and introduces two new electrical instruments. He explains Professor Lichtenberg's experiment on the electrophorus and how the powder of rosin is attracted by the positively charged parts of the electrophorus. Cavallo also discusses various powders and their conductivity when let fall on an insulated brass plate, and he describes the construction and use of his new electrometer, which is more sensitive and reliable than other electrometers of the time.'
