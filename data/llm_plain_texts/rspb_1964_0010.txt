tldr: The authors studied the properties of cytochrome oxidase and its derivatives, comparing them to other haemoproteins. They investigated the effects of carbon monoxide and cyanide compounds on the enzyme and discussed the relevance of their findings to theories of the nature of cytochromes. The study provides evidence for the existence of two different cytochromes as separate spectroscopic entities.
