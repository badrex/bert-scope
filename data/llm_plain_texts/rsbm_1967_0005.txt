tldr: Joseph Alexander Gray was a pioneering physicist in the field of radioactivity. He worked with Rutherford's group at Manchester and made significant contributions to the understanding of X-rays and y-rays. Gray discovered the'softening' of X-rays and y-rays, which later became known as the Compton effect. Despite facing several setbacks in his career, Gray's dedication to his work and passion for physics left a lasting impact on the field and influenced physics in Canada.
