tldr: Dirac proposed a new idea that led to the discovery of antiparticles, specifically the anti-electron, which has a positive charge and the same mass as an electron. This idea also revealed a symmetry between electricity and magnetism, showing that the smallest electric charge is connected to the smallest magnetic pole. The theory predicts a connection between the smallest electric charge and the smallest magnetic pole, which has not been fully explored but could lead to a better understanding of the fundamental nature of matter and energy.
