tldr: The authors studied the protonation kinetics of lithium salts, specifically anthracenide radical ions, in different solvents like dimethoxyethane (DME) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) using methanol and tert-butanol as protonating agents. They found that the contribution of dianions to the protonation process varies depending on the cation and protonating agent used. The results suggest that the protonation process can be significantly affected by the nature of the cation, protonating agent, and solvent.
