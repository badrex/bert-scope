tldr: The author investigates the existence of asymptotic directions for the volume-preserving diffeomorphism group of a compact surface, considering it as a submanifold of the full diffeomorphism group. The study shows that when the surface's curvature is positive, there are no asymptotic directions. This research contributes to understanding the geometry of surfaces and its applications in fluid mechanics and other fields.
