tldr: This article investigates the equilibrium of a cube of incompressible, neo-Hookean material under the action of three pairs of equal and oppositely directed forces. It proves that when the stress components in the deformed cube are specified, the corresponding equilibrium state is uniquely determined. The study also explores the conditions for the stability of equilibrium states in various cases and the influence of the order of force application on the equilibrium condition reached.
