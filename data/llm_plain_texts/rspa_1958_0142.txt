tldr: The author applies a generalized procedure to put Einstein's theory of gravitation into Hamiltonian form. By making a change in the action density, four of the ten degrees of freedom associated with the gravitational field drop out of the Hamiltonian formalism. This simplification comes at the expense of abandoning four-dimensional symmetry. The resulting theory allows for a clean separation of degrees of freedom and reveals the existence of gravitational waves with two independent states of polarization.
