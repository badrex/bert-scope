tldr: This article describes an apparatus used to conduct experiments on the refractions of fluids and their specific gravities. The author, Mr. Fra. Hauksbee, provides a detailed explanation of the equipment and methodology, as well as a table of specific gravities, angles of observations, and ratios of refractions for various fluids. The experiments can be performed in both daylight and candlelight, and the results can be used to determine the accuracy of the observations.
