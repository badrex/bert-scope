revised_title: General Relativity and Background Space Interpretation
semantic_tags:

tldr: The author extends Atkinson's idea of interpreting general relativity in terms of Euclidean space to any static finite gravitating system. They introduce the concept of a background space, which simplifies the interpretation of the path of a free particle, light rays, and gravitational red shift. This interpretation is applicable to any theory of gravitation where test particles' and light rays' paths are geodesics of the space-time metric.
