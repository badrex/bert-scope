tldr: The authors present a geometric description of maximal finite irreducible subgroups of GL(n, ℤ) and their corresponding lattices. They classify these subgroups for dimensions 1 to 23 and provide a table summarizing the lattices and their properties. The study of these lattices sheds light on their symmetries, relations, and additional mathematical connections.
