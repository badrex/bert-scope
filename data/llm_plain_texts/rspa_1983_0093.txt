tldr: The authors observed a strong resonant absorption for longitudinal acoustic waves in a single crystal of HoVO4, a type of enhanced nuclear paramagnet. This absorption is caused by the intrinsic direct spin-lattice relaxation process and is orders of magnitude smaller than the Orbach rate. The study provides insights into the mechanism of enhanced nuclear acoustic resonance and helps deduce the spin-lattice relaxation rate for the intrinsic direct process.
