tldr: The authors develop a method to determine the crystal reference in the nonlinear continuum theory of dislocations. They derive a system of first-order differential equations for the inverse elastic deformation field and find the integrability condition that ensures the crystal connection's curvature vanishes. The authors also provide a comparison with Kroner's theory and discuss the dual problem of determining plastic deformation and rotation.
