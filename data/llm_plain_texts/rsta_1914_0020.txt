tldr: The author investigates the lunar diurnal magnetic variations at observatories of Pavlovsk and Pola from 1897 to 1903. They found that the magnetic elements undergo regular variations with the period of a lunar day, and the lunar diurnal changes are simpler in character, taking the form of a purely semi-diurnal wave. The study of these variations can help determine the daily variation of the atmospheric electrical conductivity and provide insights into the mechanism of the lunar and solar diurnal magnetic variations.
