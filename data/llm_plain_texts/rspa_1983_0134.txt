tldr: This article discusses the theory of partial differential approximants and their invariance under transformations. The authors define invariance and explore the relationship between the original and new defining polynomials in a transformed function. They prove that invariance of an integrated approximant implies a definite relation between the original and new defining polynomials, and that any variable transformation that admits a p.d.a. invariance must be rational.
