tldr: The article investigates the propagation of elastic waves in media with hexagonal symmetry, such as zinc and beryl. The author derives the velocity, inverse, and wave surfaces for these materials and discusses the implications of their properties, including the existence of cusps and double lines on the surfaces. This study provides insights into the behavior of elastic waves in materials with hexagonal symmetry and has potential applications in the fields of solid-state physics and materials science.
