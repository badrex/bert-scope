tldr: The authors conducted experiments with a hollow cathode discharge to study the electric field, space charge, and secondary electron emission. They found that the field in the two dark spaces of a hollow cathode falls linearly with distance from the cathode, and the net space-charge density is constant. This led to an elementary theory that covers both the hollow and conventional glow discharge in various gases. The main feature of this theory is the contribution of ultra-violet quanta from the glow to the photo-electric emission from the cathodes, which is regarded as the essential factor in secondary electron emission.
