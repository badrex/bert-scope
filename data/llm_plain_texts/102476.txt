tldr: In 1691, a violent thunderstorm and lightning struck a group of reapers in Everdon, Northamptonshire, killing four people and injuring eight. The victims' clothes and bodies were riddled with holes, and their injuries resembled burns and dry, healed wounds. The survivors' wounds took a long time to heal, and some required unconventional treatments like oil of St. John's-wort and the black salve. The author provides a detailed account of the incident, including witness statements and his own thoughts on the natural causes of the accident.
