tldr: This study investigates the absorption and emission spectra of C2, CH, and OH radicals in low-pressure acetylene-oxygen flames. The researchers found that the upper state temperatures of these radicals are higher than their lower state temperatures, and they provided experimental evidence for the formation of these species in the flames. The findings contribute to the understanding of chemiluminescent and chemiionization processes in flames.
