tldr: This article discusses the author's experiments on the coagulation properties of fish eggs, specifically those of the Salmonidae family. The author found that water coagulates the eggs, while alkalies, salts, and some acids do not. The author also suggests that the coagulation of fish eggs may serve a purpose in attracting predators to the dead eggs, protecting the living ones.
