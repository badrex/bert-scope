tldr: The author analyzes pollen samples from the Early Pleistocene Crag deposits at Ludham, Norfolk, to study the area's vegetational history. They identify five stages of temperate and glacial vegetational conditions, correlating them with the Netherlands Early Pleistocene. The study provides insights into the fluctuations of climate during the Early Pleistocene and contributes to understanding the region's environmental history.
