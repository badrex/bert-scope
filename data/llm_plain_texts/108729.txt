tldr: The author describes an experimental method to generate liquid carbonic acid and examines its properties and reactions with various solid substances. The liquid carbonic acid is found to be a strong insulator of electricity and a chemically inert body with limited solubility for certain substances. This research contributes to the understanding of carbonic acid's behavior and potential applications.
