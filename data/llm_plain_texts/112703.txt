tldr: This article discusses the discovery of a new sponge species, Holtenia, found in deep-sea mud. It describes the sponge's unique structure, made up of siliceous spicules, and its adaptation to its chalk-mud habitat. The author also compares Holtenia to other sponge species and suggests a possible relationship with the Ventriculites of the chalk formation.
