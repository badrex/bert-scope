tldr: 'This article presents a mathematical analysis of deep water waves, focusing on progressive or stationary waves to the third order of approximation. The author, Lord Rayleigh, develops equations to describe the surface conditions and wave behavior, including the effects of secondary waves. The findings contribute to our understanding of wave dynamics and oceanography.'
