tldr: This paper examines the microscopic changes that occur in glass samples when exposed to high temperatures, focusing on the crystallization process and the development of prismatic jointing. The authors compare these phenomena to natural devitrification in rocks, providing insights into the geological and petrological aspects of glass transformation.
