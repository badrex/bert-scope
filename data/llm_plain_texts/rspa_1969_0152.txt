tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the equilibrium shapes of small liquid droplets in solid-liquid phase mixtures, specifically in metallic h.c.p. and metalloid systems. They found that the solid-liquid interfacial energy is highly anisotropic in these alloys, which affects the droplet shapes. The results are related to current ideas of solid-liquid interfacial structure.
