tldr: The authors developed a mathematical model to study the production of waves by the sudden release of a spherical distribution of compressed air in the atmosphere. They found that finite amplitude spherical waves, unlike plane waves, do not necessarily become shock waves and instead form a train of waves with diminishing amplitudes. This research provides a better understanding of air or 'blast' waves produced by explosions.
