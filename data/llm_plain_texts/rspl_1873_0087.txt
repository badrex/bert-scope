tldr: The author investigates the connection between explosions in coal mines and shot-firing. They found that in many cases, explosions occurred after shots had been fired, and they suggest that sound-waves from these shots could pass through safety-lamps, igniting the explosive mixtures. The author conducted experiments to demonstrate this phenomenon and proposed improvements to safety-lamp design to prevent such incidents.
