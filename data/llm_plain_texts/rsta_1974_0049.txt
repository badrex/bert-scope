tldr: This study investigates the deformation of an impulsively loaded slab and the interaction of waves within bounded media. The research focuses on the reflection of waves from interfaces between different elastic materials and provides a detailed analysis of various material responses, including polycrystalline solids, metals, water, and gases. The findings can be applied to a wide range of systems described by the nonlinear wave equation.
