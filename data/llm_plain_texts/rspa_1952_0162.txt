tldr: The authors propose a theoretical approach to understand ion exchange in cation exchangers by treating the exchanger phase as a concentrated aqueous electrolyte. They investigate the water uptake in polystyrene sulphonates of varying degrees of cross-linking and find that the anions do not contribute to the statistical entropy terms of the solutions. The osmotic coefficients of monovalent cations have similar trends as in the case of strong 1:1 electrolytes. The authors provide an approximate calculation of the distribution constants of the exchangers when in contact with solutions containing two cations.
