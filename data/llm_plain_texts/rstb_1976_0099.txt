tldr: This article discusses the structure and assembly of filamentous bacterial viruses, focusing on the Pfl strain. It explains the process of encapsulating DNA in a protein shell and the role of the packaging protein in the assembly of the virion. The article also describes the X-ray diffraction patterns and the use of molecular models to analyze the structure of the virus.
