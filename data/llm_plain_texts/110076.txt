tldr: This article describes the organs of reproduction in the Mexican Proteus, also known as Axolotl, a type of salamander. The author, Everard Home, collected specimens from a lake near Mexico and used drawings by Mr. Bauer to explain the male and female organs. He refutes previous claims made by Mr. Rusconi and supports Mr. John Hunter's work on salamander reproduction.
