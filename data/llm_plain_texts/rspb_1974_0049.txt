tldr: The choroidal tapetum lucidum of the coelacanth, Latimeria chalumnae, was examined using optical, transmission, and scanning electron microscopy. The tapetum consists of cells containing hexagonal crystals of guanine, which reflect light and cause eyeshine. The crystals are arranged parallel to each other and to the optic axis of the eye. The tapetum's structure and function are responsible for the fish's eyeshine, which is not due to true luminescence.
