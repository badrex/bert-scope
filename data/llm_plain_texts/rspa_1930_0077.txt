tldr: This study investigates vertical electric currents below thunderstorms and showers, focusing on the discharge of electricity from raised metal points during intense electric fields. The research confirms the predominance of negative potential gradients during these weather conditions and provides insights into the polarity of clouds and the total interchange of electric charges.
