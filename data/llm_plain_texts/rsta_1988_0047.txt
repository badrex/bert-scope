tldr: This article discusses the use of trace metals, particularly manganese and aluminum, as tracers for ocean circulation and mixing. Manganese's distribution reflects the influence of sources at boundaries or within the water column, providing valuable information on sources and transport pathways. Aluminum's variations in deep-ocean waters suggest its potential use as a tracer for water movement and mixing. The article also briefly mentions the potential use of beryllium and cobalt as tracers.
