  - Cahn-Hilliard equation
tldr: The authors study a gradient flow for a functional that models the interfacial motion associated with domain coarsening in binary alloys, taking into account boundary contact energy. They derive the first term in an asymptotic expansion for the solution and show that fronts rapidly develop and propagate with normal velocity, where the mean curvature of the front plays a role. The boundary contact energy also implies a contact angle condition for the front.
