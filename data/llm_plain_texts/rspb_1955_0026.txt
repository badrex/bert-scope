tldr: The authors investigated the host-tissue component of influenza viruses A and B, examining their relationship with virus-group antigens. They found strong cross-reactions between the viruses and chorioallantoic membrane extracts, suggesting that the host-tissue component may be an integral part of the virus structure, possibly essential for virus synthesis and having a determinant function in virus behavior. This research sheds light on the mechanism of virus replication and the biological significance of the host-tissue component.
