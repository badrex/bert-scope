tldr: This study investigates the tensile properties of high-purity iron single crystals at temperatures between 100 to 250Â°C. The results show that the crystals were fully ductile at higher temperatures, while at lower temperatures, their behavior ranged from fully ductile with 100% reduction in area to completely brittle with cleavage fractures and no apparent deformation. The research provides insights into the nature of the transition from ductile to brittle behavior in iron crystals and contributes to understanding the phenomenon of brittle fracture.
