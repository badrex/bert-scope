tldr: The author, C. William Siemens, presents a method for determining the depth of the sea without using a sounding-line and introduces an attraction-meter, or bathometer, to measure the attraction of the Earth. The bathometer uses a vertical column of mercury in a steel tube and is sensitive to changes in depth, allowing for more accurate measurements of oceanic basins. This instrument can also be used to measure heights and may have applications in recording the attractive influences of celestial bodies like the sun and moon.
