tldr: This study investigates the effects of low temperature on egg yolk and egg white. The research shows that freezing and thawing processes can cause changes in the structure and properties of egg components. The critical temperature range for these changes is between -1°C and -3°C. The findings have implications for understanding the behavior of biological materials under low-temperature conditions and for the preservation of eggs and other perishable food items.
