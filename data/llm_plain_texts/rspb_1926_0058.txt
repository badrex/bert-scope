tldr: This study investigates the ability of Leishmania, a parasite responsible for Kala Azar disease, to survive in cold temperatures. The researchers found that the flagellate stage of the parasite can withstand exposure to temperatures as low as -12Â°C for at least 10 days. This discovery suggests that Leishmania may be able to persist in the environment during winter, possibly within the alimentary tract of hibernating insects.
