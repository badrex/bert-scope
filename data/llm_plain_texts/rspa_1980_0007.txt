tldr: The article discusses the decay of one-dimensional periodic acoustic signals with moderate amplitude after developing a sawtooth profile containing one thin shock in each period. The author constructs a composite asymptotic expansion using Taylor shock transitions and shows that this representation is an exact solution of the Burgers equation. This solution, known as the Fay solution, has a simple interpretation as a periodic array of spreading shocks that do not interact as they interpenetrate.
