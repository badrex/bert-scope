tldr: The authors studied the tanning reaction in the oothecae of cockroaches, specifically the interaction between the secretions of the two colleterial glands. They discovered that the left gland secretes a polyphenol oxidase and the 4-O-β-glucoside of protocatechuic acid, while the right gland secretes a β-glucosidase. When mixed, the secretions interact, and the β-glucosidase liberates protocatechuic acid from its β-glucoside. The resulting acid is then oxidized in the presence of the oxidase to a quinone, which forms cross-linkages between adjacent molecules of the structural protein, creating sclerotin. This research provides a new understanding of the sclerotization process in insect oothecae.
