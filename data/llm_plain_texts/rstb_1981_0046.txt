revised_title: 'Interspecific Chromosome Manipulation in Plant Breeding'
semantic_tags:
  - Plant breeding
  - Chromosome manipulation
  - Interspecific hybridization
  - Alien gene transfer
  - Cytogenetics
tldr: 'The article discusses techniques of chromosome manipulation in plant breeding, focusing on interspecific manipulation of chromosomes. It explains how alien variation can be introduced into crop species through methods such as chromosome addition and substitution, as well as irradiation-induced translocations. The article also highlights the importance of understanding cytogenetic relations between species for successful gene transfers.'
