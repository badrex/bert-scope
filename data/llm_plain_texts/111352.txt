tldr: Eaton Hodgkinson's research on the strength of cast iron pillars led to the discovery of the relationship between the breaking weight, length, and diameter of the pillars. The study also revealed that the strength of pillars made from different types of iron varied, and the ultimate decrement of length in pillars of various lengths but of the same diameter, varies inversely as the length. Additionally, the research highlighted the differences in crushing strength of the metal in different sections of the pillars.
