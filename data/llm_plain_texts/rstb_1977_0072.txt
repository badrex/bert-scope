tldr: The article discusses the rapid growth of the Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella) population at South Georgia, which increased from 10,000 to an estimated 90,000 pups per year. The population's expansion led to the colonization of extensive breeding areas on South Georgia and nearby islands. The study examines factors influencing the population's growth and provides insights into the factors that may affect its eventual stabilization.
