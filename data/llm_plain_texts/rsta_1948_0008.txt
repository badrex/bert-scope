tldr: This paper explores the integration of laminar boundary-layer equations for a compressible fluid, focusing on the flat plate at zero incidence with or without a pressure gradient in the main stream. The study aims to understand the effects of compressibility on boundary layers and their implications for aerodynamics and fluid dynamics.
