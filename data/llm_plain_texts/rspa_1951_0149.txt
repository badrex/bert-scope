tldr: This article presents the paramagnetic resonance and hyperfine structure analysis of four cobalt salts. The results confirm the nuclear spin of cobalt ions and provide insights into the ground state of the cobalt ion in a magnetic field. The study also computes the contribution to the specific heat from the hyperfine structure for each salt and offers a new interpretation of the specific heat and susceptibility measurements of cobalt sulfate.
