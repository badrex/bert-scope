tldr: The authors investigated the resonance collision of normal and metastable helium atoms and calculated cross-sections for total elastic scattering, diffusion, and transfer of excitation. The theoretical diffusion coefficient of metastable atoms in normal helium agreed reasonably with experimental results. The transfer cross-section showed an unusual variation, being small for low collision energies and reaching a maximum for collisions about 1 eV. The study compared their findings with experiments by Reynolds and provided a theoretical understanding of the process.
