tldr: The authors conducted experiments using laser resonance absorption spectroscopy to measure hydroxyl radical concentrations and gas temperature during oscillatory ignition of hydrogen in a jet-stirred flow reactor. They compared the experimental results with numerical calculations under the same reaction conditions, providing insights into the oscillatory ignition process.
