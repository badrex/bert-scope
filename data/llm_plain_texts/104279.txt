tldr: Edmund Stone discovered two new species of lines of the third order, which were not mentioned by Sir Isaac Newton or Mr. Sterling. He explained the properties of these lines and their corresponding curves, and provided illustrations to support his findings. Stone's work expanded the understanding of the 72 species of lines of the third order previously known.
