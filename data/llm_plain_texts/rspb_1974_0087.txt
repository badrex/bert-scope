tldr: The authors conducted electrophysiological investigations on the retino-tectal projection in amphibian larvae, demonstrating that functioning synaptic junctions are present in the early larval stages. As development progresses, the area on the tectum that can be synaptically activated expands, showing that connections between pre- and postsynaptic neurons in this system are not invariant but shift continuously throughout development.
