tldr: Researchers developed precise methods to study the optomotor responses of insects, focusing on the housefly Musca domestica. They used stimulus patterns with controlled noise and a digital computer system to analyze responses. The study provided detailed information on the optical properties of ommatidia and the motion-detection capabilities of the insect's eye, revealing that the photoreceptors have visual fields with specific sensitivity characteristics. The research also showed that the insect's ability to detect motion involves the interaction of a few adjacent ommatidia, providing a high signal-to-noise ratio for the nervous system.
