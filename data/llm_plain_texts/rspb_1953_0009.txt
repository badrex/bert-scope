tldr: The author's study investigates the role of depot fat in the hypothalamus' control of food intake in rats. They found that the hypothalamus prevents excessive calorie intake, and damage to this area leads to obesity. The study also suggests that the hypothalamic satiety mechanism is related to sensitivity to circulating metabolites, rather than a thermosensitive center as previously thought. This research provides insights into the mechanisms of obesity and the regulation of food intake.
