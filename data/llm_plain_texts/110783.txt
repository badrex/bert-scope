tldr: The author, John Frederick William Herschel, studied the effects of solar spectrum rays on vegetable colors and discovered that the action of the spectrum is mainly confined to the luminous rays. He also developed a new photographic process called Chrysotype, which uses ammonio-citrate of iron, ferro-sesquicyanuret of potassium, and a neutral solution of gold to create sharp and detailed images.
