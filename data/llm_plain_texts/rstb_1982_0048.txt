tldr: 'This article discusses the effects of oil pollution on marine planktonic ecosystems. It highlights the challenges in studying these effects due to the mobile nature of plankton habitats and the difficulty of conducting long-term studies. The authors review laboratory experiments, enclosed ecosystem studies, and field observations to understand the impacts of oil on planktonic organisms. They find that oil spills can cause temporary changes in zooplankton densities and increases in phytoplankton production, but no lasting damage to planktonic ecosystems. The article also emphasizes the need for further research on chronically polluted inshore areas, arctic ecosystems, and coral reefs.'
