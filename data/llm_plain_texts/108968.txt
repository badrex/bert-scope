semantic_tags:
  - Gas dynamics

tldr: The author, J. Clerk Maxwell, explores the dynamical theory of gases and their properties, including viscosity and the modulus of the time of relaxation. He discusses the relationship between temperature, density, and viscosity, and presents experimental results on the transpiration of gases and the viscosity of air. Maxwell's work contributes to the understanding of gas behavior and the development of theories in physics.
