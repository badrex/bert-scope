tldr: This article investigates the scattering of elastic waves set up by a transient body force in the interior of an infinite wedge with free surfaces. The authors use transform methods to find exact forms for the stress components required to vanish at the free surfaces, and discuss the unique challenges posed by non-convex wedges. The findings have implications for understanding wave behavior in elastic materials and the development of more accurate models for wave diffraction.
