tldr: The authors develop a variational approach to study the overall sink strength of a nonlinear lossy composite medium. They introduce a strict definition for the overall function and apply variational principles to derive bounds for the sink strength. The study focuses on a two-phase composite medium and provides explicit results for a specific case, demonstrating the sensitivity of the system to the microstructure and the potential use of the new variational formulation.
