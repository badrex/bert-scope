tldr: The authors studied the noise produced by a flame developing in a spherical bubble of homogeneous combustible gas ignited by a spark. They found that the flame acts as a monopole source of sound, with the pressure waveform dependent on the rate of change of the rate of increase of the gas volume during combustion. The study provides a better understanding of the relationship between flame structure and radiated sound in simpler combustion systems.
