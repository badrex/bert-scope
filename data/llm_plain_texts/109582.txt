tldr: Thomas Andrew Knight conducted experiments to understand the motion of sap in trees. He found that the vessels of the bark are better suited to carry fluids towards the roots than in the opposite direction. Knight also discovered that plant vessels have valves, similar to the venous system in animals, which help direct the flow of sap. This research provides insights into plant growth and challenges previous experiments on sap flow.
