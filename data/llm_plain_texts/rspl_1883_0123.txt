tldr: This article presents the mean diurnal variation of magnetic declination at the Circumpolar station at Fort Rae, British North America, from September 1882 to August 1883. The hourly means for each month are plotted, including the effects of disturbances that influenced the measurements, particularly in winter months. The author highlights the impact of easterly disturbances on the increase of mean declination.
