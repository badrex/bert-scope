tldr: The authors analyze the heat flux from the Earth's surface using free convection and explain how it satisfies the theoretical law of free convection. They also discuss the role of wind and the different types of free convection, such as point, line, and plane elements. The study provides a better understanding of heat transfer in the Earth's surface layers and its implications for atmospheric science and environmental science.
