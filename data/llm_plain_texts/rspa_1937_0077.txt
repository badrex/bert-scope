tldr: This article extends the quantum electrodynamics of the New Field Theory to include the dynamics of charged particles. The author reinterprets the Poisson brackets as commutation relations and discusses the commutation rules for various variables. The intrinsic momenta of charged particles are introduced, and the total linear momentum is shown to be the space-displacement operator. The Hamiltonian, which determines the change in variables with time, is also discussed.
