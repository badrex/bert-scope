tldr: 'The authors studied the fluid motion of bent planes and aerofoils, finding that a large camber provides a better lift-to-surface ratio. They also discovered that the lift on a bent plane is much greater than on its chord, making bent planes more efficient. As the length of the front plane increases, the total lift decreases, but the lift-to-drift ratio increases.'
