tldr: The authors discuss the complex and integrated nature of the flagellar apparatus in the alga G. reinhardii, focusing on the twin flagella and their regeneration. They explore the control mechanisms involved in the regeneration process and the interplay between regenerative and regressive mechanisms. The flagellar apparatus serves as a model organelle for understanding morphopoiesis and growth.
