revised_title: 'Mechanism of Action and Reaction Intermediates of Pepsin'
semantic_tags:
  - Enzyme Mechanism
  - Pepsin
  - Proteinase
  - Hydrolysis
  - Transpeptidation
tldr: The author investigates the mechanism of action of pepsin, a proteinase enzyme, and proposes a mechanism compatible with its hydrolytic, transpeptidation, and isotopic exchange activities. The study focuses on the amino-enzyme intermediate and examines the possibility of an acyl-enzyme intermediate. The author also discusses the rate-determining step and attempts to trap the amino-enzyme intermediate using various reagents.
