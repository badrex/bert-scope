tldr: The authors identified a path in yeast from mitochondria to the nucleus that may have a regulatory function in mitochondrial biogenesis. They found that the levels of expression of some nuclear DNA sequences in yeast correlate with the quality or quantity of mitochondrial DNA, suggesting a communication path between mitochondria and the nucleus. This path may help yeast cells monitor and respond to mitochondrial apportionment during growth and differentiation.
