tldr: The author conducted experiments to prove that ice and other substances can exist in the solid state at temperatures far above their usual melting points. They demonstrated this by creating a vacuum and applying heat to the substances, observing their behavior under various conditions. These experiments provided evidence for the existence of ice and other bodies in the solid state at elevated temperatures.
