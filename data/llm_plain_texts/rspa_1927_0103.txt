  - Manganese
  - Metallic structures
tldr: The authors analyze the crystal structure of alpha-manganese using X-ray diffraction and determine that it has a body-centered cubic cell with 58 atoms per unit cell. They also discuss the process of eliminating alternative structures to arrive at this conclusion.
