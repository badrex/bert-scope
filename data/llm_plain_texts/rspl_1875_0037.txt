tldr: The author, William Crookes, conducted experiments on the repulsion resulting from radiation and the effects of different surfaces and coatings on the action of radiation. He developed a new instrument called the "Bathometer" or "Light-Mill" to measure the amount of incident light and the impact of various screens and colors on the repulsion. The experiments showed that the repulsion was inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the light source and the instrument.
