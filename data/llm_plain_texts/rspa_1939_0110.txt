tldr: This article explores the classical behavior of an uncharged meson field with a characteristic length connected to its rest mass. The authors investigate the differences between meson theory and radiation theory and find that the finite rest mass of the meson does not introduce significant differences in behavior at high energies. They derive new classical equations for a point neutron and calculate the scattering of mesons by neutrons, obtaining a formula that generalizes the Thomson formula as modified by Dirac.
