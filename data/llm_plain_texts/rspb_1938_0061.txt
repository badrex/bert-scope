tldr: This article investigates the formation of molecular complexes in lipoid monolayers, focusing on the interaction between different types of hydrocarbon chains and aromatic ring structures. The authors demonstrate how changes in the associating forces, such as Van der Waals adhesion or polar heads, can alter the nature and stability of these complexes. They also explore the role of substrate concentration and the formation of two-dimensional crystalline lattices in these systems.
