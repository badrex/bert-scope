tldr: 'In this article, William Herschel discusses his observations of the polar regions of Mars and the inclination of its axis. He uses a series of observations to determine the position of the poles and the spheroidal figure of the planet. He also examines the possibility of using the polar spots to measure the inclination and nodes of Mars' axis. The observations provide insights into the planet's diurnal rotation and the position of its poles, which can help improve our understanding of Mars and its atmosphere.'
