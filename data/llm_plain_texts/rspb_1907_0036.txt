tldr: The author investigates the complex relations between globulins, electrolytes, and colloidal solutions. Globulins are a class of proteins that occur in both animal and plant tissues and have diverse interactions with acids, alkalies, and neutral salts. The author discovers that globulins form both acid and basic salts, making them amphoteric electrolytes. They also find that globulins can form colloidal solutions, which have no saturation points and are chemically inert. This research sheds light on the properties and behavior of globulins and their interactions with various substances.
