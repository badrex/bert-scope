tldr: The author, Monsr de L'Isle, describes his successful attempt to measure the basis for mapping the bottom of the Gulf of Finland. He used precise distances between two castles to measure the basis and expected great exactness in the work. He also planned to measure triangles along the coasts of Ingria and Livonia to create accurate charts for the Baltic Sea region.
