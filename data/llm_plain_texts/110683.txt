tldr: The author analyzed the chemical composition of various resins, such as jalap, labdanum, Berengela, Retin asphalt, ammonia, opoponax, and assafoetida. They found that resins undergo partial decomposition when heated, sometimes producing benzoic acid. The author concluded that resins should be considered as analogous groups of compounds with similar radicals, and provided modified formulas for different types of resins.
