tldr: The authors, J. A. Wanklyn and J. Robinson, present a method to distinguish between real and apparent vapour-densities of chemical compounds by using diffusion analysis. They explain that the density of a vaporized chemical compound may not be its true density, as it could be the mean density of its decomposition products. The authors demonstrate their method using examples of substances like hydrated sulphurous acid, ammoniacal salts, and pentachloride of phosphorus, and they plan to continue researching other cases of abnormal vapour-density.
