tldr: The article investigates a paradox in the theory of sound reflection, where pressure doubles at an infinite reflecting plane. The author applies Sommerfeld's theory of diffraction and examines the reflection of sound pulses by semi-infinite screens and infinite wedges. The results show that the simple theory of reflection breaks down when the angle between the direction of propagation of the incident pulse and the reflector becomes small. The diffracted pulse from the edge of the screen must be taken into account, invalidating the paradoxical conclusion from the simple theory.
