tldr: 'The author conducted experiments to understand the effect of fog on sound signals and their effectiveness in guiding mariners. They found that fog significantly reduces the distance sound signals can travel, leading to the need for more effective fog signals. The author also tested various sound-producing instruments, including steam-whistles and a steam-siren, to determine their performance in different fog conditions.'
