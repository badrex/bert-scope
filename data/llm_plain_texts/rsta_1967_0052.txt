tldr: This article explores the Lagrange problem in the calculus of variations, focusing on finding geodesic arcs that minimize the integral. The author introduces the concept of a parabolic structure on differentiable manifolds and studies the exponential map to understand the behavior of these structures. The article proves several theorems related to the Lagrange problem and provides insights into approximating geodesic arcs using Morse theory.
