semantic_tags:
  - Electromagnetism
  - Electrical Interference
  - Wave Theory
  - Electrometry
  - Physics Experiments
tldr: The author investigates electrical interference phenomena, similar to Newton's Rings, exhibited by waves along wires. They improve the experimental conditions and present new results confirming the original conclusions. The author uses a modified apparatus and explains the phenomena mathematically.
