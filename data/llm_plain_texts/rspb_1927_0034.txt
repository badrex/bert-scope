tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the direct and indirect effects of X-rays on developing chick embryos. They found that X-ray exposure led to a reduction in mitosis, cell degeneration, and in some cases, cystic and necrotic changes. The study demonstrated the potential harm of X-ray exposure on developing organisms and the importance of understanding the mechanisms of radiation effects on cells and tissues.
