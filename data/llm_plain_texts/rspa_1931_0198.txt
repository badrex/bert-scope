tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the corrosion of iron and mild steel using the oxygen-absorption method. They found that the corrosion rate and the composition of the corrosion products depend on the type of solution and the presence of oxygen. The results showed that the standard steel had a faster corrosion rate than the commercial steel, and the pure iron had a slower rate in some cases. The study provides insights into the factors affecting metallic corrosion and the development of methods to prevent or control it.
