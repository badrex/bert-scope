tldr: At the 1897 Anniversary Meeting of the Royal Society, researchers discussed their findings on coral reef growth and the depth at which true reef has been found. They discovered that coral must have grown in abundance in the area now represented by Funafuti atoll, surrounded by deep water. The full report of the meeting, including the President's Address and Report of Council, can be found in the 1897-8 Year-book.
