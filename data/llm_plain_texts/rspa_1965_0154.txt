tldr: The authors propose an alternative coupling scheme for particles in a spin S octet, providing predictions for their decay modes. They consider the possibility of intrinsic broken multiplets and calculate the effective Lagrangian, leading to predictions for the decay widths of the particles in the multiplet.
