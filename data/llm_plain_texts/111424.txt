tldr: The author, Frederick Currey, examines the reproductive organs of Sphaeriaceous fungi and their diverse forms. He discusses the physiological importance of these findings and how they may impact future systematic arrangements. Currey also explores the occurrence of different fructification states within the same fungal species and the nature of the cells that make up these structures.
