tldr: The author, J. P. Gassiot, describes a method he developed to reproduce colors on steel plates, inspired by the work of Signor Nobili. Gassiot used two constant cells, a steel plate, and a battery to create the images. The process involved placing a figure on a card, which was then covered by a wooden ring and a convex copper plate. The steel plate was connected to the positive electrode of the battery, while the negative electrode was placed in the center of the copper plate. The image was formed in 15 to 35 seconds.
