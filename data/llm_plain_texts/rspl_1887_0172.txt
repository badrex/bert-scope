tldr: The author investigates the reducing agent in normal urine and its relationship to kreatinin. They find that the reducing agent is not glucose and cannot be identified as kreatinin either. The author also discovers that prolonged boiling with dilute potassium hydrate solution disintegrates the reducing agent in urine. They successfully remove the reducing agent from urine using a strong aqueous solution of mercuric chloride.
