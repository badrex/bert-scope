tldr: The authors demonstrate that the Adams and Elsasser dynamo integrals can be expressed in terms of Wigner coefficients, making it easier to find and evaluate these integrals. They also show that Wigner coefficients lead to symmetries and selection rules for the integrals, and reveal a useful numerical connection between them. This simplifies the process of calculating these integrals and opens up possibilities for generalizing the method to handle higher-order coupling integrals.
