tldr: This study investigates the distribution and fate of trace metals in the North Sea, focusing on the influence of various processes such as river water mixing, particle-solution interactions, and non-riverine inputs. The research highlights the importance of understanding these processes to develop water quality models for the North Sea and address potential environmental concerns related to trace metal pollution.
