tldr: This article investigates the theory of resonance testing, focusing on damped forced vibration of systems with one or multiple degrees of freedom. It discusses various resonance testing techniques and their underlying assumptions, with a focus on hysteretic damping. The article provides a theoretical background for understanding resonance tests and their applications in fields like aeronautical engineering.
