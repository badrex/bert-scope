tldr: This article discusses rocket and spacecraft studies of ultraviolet emissions from various astrophysical targets, such as cool stars, planetary observations, and comets. The research provides detailed information about the spectral shapes of hydrogen and magnesium emissions from stars, the brightness of bright stars, and the absence of an atomic hydrogen atmosphere on the Moon. Additionally, the study examines the emissions from comets and the potential formation of their outer layers.
