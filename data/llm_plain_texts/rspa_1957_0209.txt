revised_title: Direct Determination of Rate Constants for Radical-Radical Interactions in the Gas Phase

tldr: The authors developed a method to directly determine the rate constants for radical-radical interactions in the gas phase, focusing on the recombination of methyl radicals. They used the mercury-photosensitized decomposition of acetone vapor as a source of methyl radicals and found that the rate constant for recombination at room temperature was in good agreement with previous methods.
