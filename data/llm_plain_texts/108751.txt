tldr: The author conducted experiments at Holyhead, North Wales, to determine the transit-velocity of waves similar to earthquake waves through local rock formations. They used powerful explosions to create shockwaves and studied their propagation through the rock. The results provided valuable insights into the behavior of waves in different types of rock formations and helped to better understand earthquake phenomena.
