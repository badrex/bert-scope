tldr: The author extends the quasi-equilibrium statistical method to the nonlinear region to study ionic recombination in an ambient gas. They introduce nonlinearity by treating ion-pairs with inward radial motion separately from those with outward radial motion, resulting in coupled integro-differential equations. This method helps to understand the recombination coefficient's variation with the ambient gas number density and provides an alternative explanation to the concept of a trapping radius.
