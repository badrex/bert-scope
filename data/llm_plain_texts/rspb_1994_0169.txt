tldr: This study investigates how body size, mating patterns, testis size, and sperm lengths affect sperm competition in butterflies. The research found that testis size correlates with body size and increases with the risk of sperm competition. Both eupyrene and apyrene sperm lengths are positively correlated with body size. After controlling for body size, eupyrene sperm lengths are greater in species where males face higher risks of sperm competition. These findings suggest that sperm competition in butterflies selects for increased investment in spermatogenesis and longer fertilizing sperm, which may be faster and more powerful.
