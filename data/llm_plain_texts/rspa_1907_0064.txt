tldr: The author investigates the force required to stop a moving electrified sphere using the method of pulses. They find that the force is constant during the time it acts and is determined by the energy and momentum in the compound pulse formed by the starting and stopping of the sphere. The calculations are applied to spheres with both surface and volume charges, providing insights into the forces involved in the process.
