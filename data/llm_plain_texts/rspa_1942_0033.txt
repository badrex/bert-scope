tldr: This article investigates the effect of a free surface on compressional (shock) waves in both shallow and deep water. The study uses exact mathematical solutions to analyze several idealized problems and finds that the pressure never exceeds the shock pressure due to the maximum velocity of impact. Suction can occur in some cases, which may have serious consequences for erosion. The research provides theoretical background for experiments on wave impact and has significant mathematical and physical implications.
