tldr: The author investigates the inorganic composition of blood in both vertebrates and invertebrates, focusing on the origin of these components. They argue that the inorganic composition of blood in mammals is similar to that of ancient ocean water, suggesting a possible oceanic origin. The author analyzes blood samples from various invertebrates and lower vertebrates to further explore this connection and understand the evolution of blood composition in animals.
