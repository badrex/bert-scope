tldr: In this series of experiments, Michael Faraday discovered that certain metals possess the ability to induce the combination of gaseous bodies, such as oxygen and hydrogen, at common or low temperatures. This phenomenon, now known as the electrochemical properties of metals, is crucial for understanding the behavior of elements in various chemical reactions and processes. Faraday's findings expanded the knowledge of chemistry and paved the way for further research in the field of electrochemistry.
