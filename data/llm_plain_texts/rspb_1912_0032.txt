revised_title: 'Urease: A Selective Enzyme and Its Interaction with Urea'
semantic_tags:
  - Enzyme action
  - Urease
  - Urea hydrolysis
  - Soja beans
  - Biochemistry
tldr: The authors studied the enzyme urease, which is found in Soja beans and plays a role in breaking down urea. They describe the process of extracting and preparing the enzyme for further research. Urease is a selective enzyme that accelerates the hydrolysis of urea, which is important for understanding the role of enzymes in biological processes and their potential applications in industry.
