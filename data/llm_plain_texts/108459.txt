tldr: This article presents an experimental investigation into the strength of wrought-iron plates and their riveted joints in ship-building. The author, William Fairbairn, conducted various tests to determine the resistance of plates to tensile, compressive, and impact forces. The results showed that iron ships, when properly constructed, are more buoyant, safer, and more durable than wooden ships. The study also provides valuable insights into the best methods of riveting and the proportional strength of rivets and joints.
