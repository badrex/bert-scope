tldr: This article discusses the unique tidal patterns and diurnal inequalities observed in Bombay and Kurrachee, comparing them to tides on the English coast. The author explains the differences in tidal movements due to the attraction of the sun and moon and how these factors affect the formation of diurnal and semidiurnal tides. The study provides insights into the complex nature of diurnal tides and their impact on tidal heights and times.
