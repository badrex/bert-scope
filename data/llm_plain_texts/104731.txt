tldr: The author, William Stukely, suggests that earthquakes are caused by electrical shocks similar to those in electrical experiments. He believes that the Earth was in a highly electrified state during the unusual winter, which led to the vibrations and shocks experienced during earthquakes. Stukely also explains why earthquakes are more frequent in maritime towns and discusses the role of Providence in these natural events.
