tldr: In a letter to Sir Joseph Banks, Rev. Mr. B. Hutchinson describes an unusual aurora borealis observed in 1790. The luminous arch resembled a rainbow and appeared as a semicircle in the sky. The phenomenon was observed during a calm, clear night with a slight frost. Hutchinson also provides information on the location and latitude of the observation site, suggesting that similar observations in London or Greenwich could help determine the height of the phenomenon.
