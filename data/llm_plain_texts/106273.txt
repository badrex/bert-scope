tldr: This article discusses a case study of a woman who experienced violent asthmatic fits triggered by the effluvia of ipecacuanha. The author, William Scott, observed that the woman's symptoms were caused by the medicine's fumes affecting her nervous system. To prevent further attacks, the couple took precautions to avoid exposure to the medicine. The woman eventually recovered after several weeks of treatment.
