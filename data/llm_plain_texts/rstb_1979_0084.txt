tldr: This study investigates the docking maneuver of ethidium and its carboxylated derivative at the DNA receptor using quantum mechanical methods. The research aims to determine if the drug molecules are pre-aligned for effective docking or if the receptor induces the ligand orientation. The molecular electrostatic potential surrounding the receptor is mapped, and the orientation of the drug molecules is studied in a simplified anionic field. The results show that the receptor induces an orientation in the approaching ligand, and the energy involved in modifying the alignment is attributed to electrostatic interactions and induced electron delocalization.
