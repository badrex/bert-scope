tldr: This article presents the general mean-variance portfolio selection problem in finance, which aims to find the optimal portfolio that maximizes returns while minimizing risk. The author discusses the mathematical models and methods used to solve this problem, including the critical line algorithm. The article also explores the applications of this theory in real-world financial scenarios and the importance of considering constraints such as budget, turnover, and exogenous assets.
