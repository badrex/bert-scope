tldr: The author investigates the stability of various dome forms, including Gothic, parabolic, elliptical, and ogival, using mathematical formulas. They analyze the weakest joint positions and horizontal thrusts for each type of dome, providing insights into the design and construction of stable domes. The study also includes a spherical dome with non-uniform thickness, offering recommendations for pier thickness and stability equations.
