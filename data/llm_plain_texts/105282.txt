tldr: The author, Richard Forster, conducted a study to estimate the population of England by counting houses and examining window tax records. He found that the total number of houses in the country was 1,427,110, and based on this, he estimated the population to be slightly over seven and a half million. Forster acknowledges that his method is not perfect but believes it is closer to the truth than previous estimates.
