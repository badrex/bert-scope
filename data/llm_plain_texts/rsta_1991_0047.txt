tldr: This article investigates the behavior and influence of fluids in subduction zones, specifically in accretionary prisms. It examines the effects of permeability variations on fluid flow and how faults play a crucial role in focusing fluid expulsion. The study compares the permeability structures of muddy and sandy accretionary prisms, highlighting the importance of understanding fluid flow in subduction zones for geological research and future studies.
