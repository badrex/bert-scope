tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the respiratory activity of various plant species during germination, measuring both carbon dioxide evolution and oxygen absorption. They found that the respiratory quotient varies during germination, with initial values near unity, then falling to a minimum of around 0.75 within two days. The authors suggest that the respiratory quotient is related to the nature of the substances used at different stages of germination, such as hexose sugars, fats, and carbohydrates.
