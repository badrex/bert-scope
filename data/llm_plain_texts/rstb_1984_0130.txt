tldr: This article discusses the role of stable complexes in repressing and activating eukaryotic genes. The author describes the characteristics and composition of these complexes and how they maintain the activity or repression of 5S RNA genes. The study focuses on understanding the molecular basis of gene control in Xenopus, using transcription experiments and chromatin analysis.
