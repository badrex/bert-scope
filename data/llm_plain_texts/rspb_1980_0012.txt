tldr: The authors analyzed the low angle X-ray diffraction pattern from insect flight muscle in rigor to understand the structure and interaction of actin and myosin filaments. They found that the cross-bridges between actin and myosin interact with approximately one-third of the actin monomers and have a strong preference for a particular orientation. The study provides a formal description of the structure of rigor muscle and helps interpret the diffraction pattern.
