tldr: The authors investigated the heat production associated with nerve impulses in non-medullated nerve fibers. They discovered that the initial heat production is much larger than previously thought and is followed by a slower heat absorption. The findings suggest that a substantial part of the heat during an impulse may be derived from the interchange of Na and K ions or from chemical reactions occurring in the excitable membrane.
