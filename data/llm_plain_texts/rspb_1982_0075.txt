tldr: The study investigates the central projections of lateral line and cutaneous sensory fibres in Xenopus laevis. The researchers found that lateral line fibres terminate in a dorsomedial region of the medulla, while cutaneous sensory fibres project caudally to the cervical spinal cord. The findings provide insights into the central processing of lateral line information and the interactions between acoustico-lateralis and somatosensory inputs.
