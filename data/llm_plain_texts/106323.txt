tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the effects of various effluvia, such as animal, vegetable, and soil substances, on the air quality. They found that animal exhalations, putrid air, and certain vegetable substances can negatively impact the air, while fresh air and certain winds can improve it. The study also confirmed that human feces, in a natural state, are not very infectious.
