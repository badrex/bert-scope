tldr: This article explores the effect of ozone on the temperature of the upper atmosphere, using a graphical method to calculate the radiative equilibrium temperature. The authors find that ozone plays a significant role in maintaining the temperature distribution in the stratosphere and discuss the implications of this on climate and atmospheric circulation.
