tldr: The author, Henry Kater, discusses the construction and adjustment of the new standards of weights and measures in the United Kingdom. He explains the importance of determining the length of the pendulum vibrating seconds in London and how it is used to establish the standards. Kater also compares his findings with those of French scientist M. Biot and examines the accuracy of the methods used. The new standards, including the Imperial Standard Yard and the Parliamentary Standard Troy Pound, were established to ensure uniformity in weights and measures across the country.
