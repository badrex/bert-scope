tldr: The author's experiments show that iron which has been overstrained and is in a semi-plastic state can recover its elasticity over time. This recovery can also be accelerated by increasing the temperature or applying mechanical vibrations. The process of recovery and the effects of temperature and mechanical vibrations on it are discussed in detail.
