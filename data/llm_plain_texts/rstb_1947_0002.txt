tldr: The article investigates the innervation and actions of the neurophypophysis using the method of remote-control stimulation. The study shows that stimulation of the neurohypophysis in conscious rabbits causes inhibition of water diuresis, an increase in urinary chlorides, and a marked increase in the activity of the oestrous and oestrogenized uterus. These effects could be duplicated by intravenous injection of posterior lobe extracts. The research aims to understand the control exerted by the hypothalamus and other parts of the nervous system over the pituitary gland and the endocrine system.
