tldr: This study investigates the K-Ar geochronology and paleomagnetism of volcanic rocks in the Lesser Antilles island arc. The research provides age ranges for the outer and inner arcs, fitting with the disconnection of the sea floor spreading in the North Atlantic. The findings contribute to understanding the tectonic history of the region and the development of the Caribbean plate.
