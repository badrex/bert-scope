tldr: The author, Mr. Horsley, describes a simple and accurate method for measuring rainfall depth using a cylindrical measure and gage. He records the rainfall depth from April 1, 1722, to April 1, 1723, in Widdrington, Northumberland, and compares it to other locations like Upminster, Paris, and Lisle. The study reveals that some summer months were very wet, while some winter months were very dry, with the overall rainfall being close to the mean quantity of rain at the other locations.
