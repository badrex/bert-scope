tldr: This article investigates the relationship between electrical discharges and intense vortices, specifically tornadoes. The author proposes a model that considers the magnetohydrodynamic effects of corona discharges, which can generate a flow field driven by the Lorentz force. The model, though simple, is compatible with updraft velocities and provides a qualitative understanding of tornado formation, supporting the idea that electrical activity plays a role in tornadoes.
