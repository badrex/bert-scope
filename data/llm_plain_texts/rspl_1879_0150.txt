tldr: The author investigates the solubility of solids in gases and the effect of temperature and pressure on this solubility. They find that a gas must have a certain density and temperature to act as a solvent, and that increasing pressure can enhance a gas's solvent power. The study also highlights the importance of molecular closeness and the role of external pressure in dissolving solids in gases.
