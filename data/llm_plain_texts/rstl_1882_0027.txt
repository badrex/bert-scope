tldr: The author investigates the effects of heat on haloid compounds of silver, mercury, lead, and copper. They explore the anomalous behavior of these compounds during heating and cooling, including their expansion and contraction, and the changes in their physical properties. The research provides insights into the molecular constitution and the physical structure of these materials.
