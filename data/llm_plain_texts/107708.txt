tldr: 'Humphry Davy discovered that sea water corrodes copper through a chemical reaction involving oxygen from the air. He found that attaching a small piece of a more reactive metal, such as zinc or tin, to the copper would prevent the corrosion. This method could be applied to ships, protecting their copper sheeting and increasing their durability.'
