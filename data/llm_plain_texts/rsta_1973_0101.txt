tldr: The authors studied the transport and separation of sorbable gases in microporous carbon membranes, focusing on isothermal and thermo-osmotic transport. They used two types of carbon membranes, Carbolac and Graphon, with different surface areas and properties. The study involved measuring equilibrium properties, isothermal transport, and thermo-osmotic transport of various gases. The results showed that the more homogeneous Graphon membrane had greater mobility of adsorbed molecules and better gas separation potential.
