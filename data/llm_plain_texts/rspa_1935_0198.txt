tldr: The authors measured the absorption coefficients of lead, tin, copper, and iron for monochromatic X-ray beams with wave-lengths ranging from 50 to 20 units. They used an improved experimental method to determine the dependence of the absorption coefficient on the wave-length and the atomic number of the absorbing element. The results provide valuable data for applications in radiation measurement and the understanding of photoelectric absorption.
