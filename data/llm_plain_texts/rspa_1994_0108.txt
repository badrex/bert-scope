tldr: This article presents a general theory for obtaining asymptotic formulae for time-domain waveforms associated with double integrals of rapidly-varying isolated pulses. The method is an extension of the time-domain asymptotics of single integrals and represents a generalization of the method of stationary phase to integrals with non-sinusoidal integrands. The author demonstrates the efficacy of the asymptotic scheme for a particular example and discusses the transitional case of the coalescence of interior stationary points.
