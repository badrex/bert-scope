tldr: The authors derive a flux integral for axisymmetric perturbations of static space-times with sources like a Maxwell field or a perfect fluid. This integral ensures the conservation of energy in the scattering of radiation and transformation of one kind of radiation into another. The flux integral is particularly useful in understanding the scattering of radiation by extreme Reissner-Nordstrom black holes and in reformulating the problem of nonradial oscillations of a star with gravitational radiation emission as a problem in scattering theory.
