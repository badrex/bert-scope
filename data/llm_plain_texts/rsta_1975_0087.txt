tldr: This article investigates the influence of Earth's rotation on its free oscillations. The authors explore the effects of rotation on the normal mode eigensolutions and show how it alters the fundamental mathematical and physical properties of these solutions. They also examine the influence of rotation on the zero-frequency rigid body translational and rotational modes of a non-rotating Earth model and discuss the corresponding rigid body modes of a rotating Earth model in excitation calculations.
