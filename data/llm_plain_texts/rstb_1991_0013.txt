tldr: The article discusses the role of neurotrophins, including nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), in the development and regeneration of the nervous system. These structurally related proteins support the survival of specific populations of embryonic vertebrate neurons. The article also explores the binding characteristics of these neurotrophins to their receptors, which play a crucial role in neuronal survival and development.
