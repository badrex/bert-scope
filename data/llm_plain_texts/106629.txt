tldr: This article examines the reasons behind the higher mortality rate of males compared to females in early life, particularly in urban areas. The author, Joseph Clarke, presents data from a registry at the Lying-in Hospital in Dublin and discusses factors such as nutrition, anatomy, and the impact of urban environments on the health of newborn males. The findings suggest that male fetuses require more nutrition and are more susceptible to injury during delivery, leading to a higher mortality rate in males.
