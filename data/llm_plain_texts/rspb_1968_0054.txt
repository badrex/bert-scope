tldr: This article discusses the presence of vanadium and other metals in ascidians, focusing on their biochemistry and possible functions. The author investigates the vanadocytes of the Ascidiidae family, which contain a high concentration of vanadium and sulfuric acid. The vanadocytes may serve as oxygen carriers in low oxygen tension conditions, and the reducing power of the vanadium complex may play a role in the reduction-oxidation mechanisms of the cell.
