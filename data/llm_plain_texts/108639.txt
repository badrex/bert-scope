tldr: The author presents a method to find symmetric functions of roots in systems of equations. By using the resultant of a system of equations, the author demonstrates how to express symmetric functions of the roots in terms of coefficients. The process is applied to two specific cases: a linear equation and a quadratic equation, and a linear equation and a cubic equation.
