tldr: The author reevaluates the Landau constant in mixing layers, finding that the mean flow distortion in the critical layer induces a jump in the streamwise velocity of the fundamental, leading to a positive Landau constant. This result agrees with recent numerical calculations and contradicts a previous analysis.
