tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effect of heat on the density of various minerals. They discovered that when heated to redness, the density of minerals like idocrase, garnets, and felspar decreases temporarily but returns to its original state after a month. This phenomenon suggests that minerals can absorb and release heat without undergoing a change of state or composition.
