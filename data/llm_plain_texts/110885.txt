tldr: The author, Baden Powell, conducted experiments on the elliptic polarization of light by reflecting it off various metallic surfaces. He varied the angle of the incident rays and the position of the plane of analysis, and used different metals as reflecting surfaces. The results were analyzed using the undulatory theory of light, and a unique polariscope was employed in the experiments.
