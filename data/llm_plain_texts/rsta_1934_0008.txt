tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the behavior of air layers subjected to single shear, observing the formation of longitudinal and transverse rolls, and the effects of different speeds and conditions on these patterns. Their findings provide insights into the complex patterns and phenomena found in the atmosphere, such as polygons, chains, and rectangular patterns.
