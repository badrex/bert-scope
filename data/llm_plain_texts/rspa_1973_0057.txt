tldr: The authors present a theoretical description of ionic states observed by high energy photoelectron spectroscopy. They calculate core ionization potentials of simple molecules using ab initio molecular wavefunctions and consider orbital relaxation effects. The study provides a better understanding of core binding energies and the origin of satellite peaks in high-energy photoelectron spectra.
