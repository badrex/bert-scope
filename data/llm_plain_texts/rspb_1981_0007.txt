tldr: The study investigates the morphological differentiation of nerve cells in thin organotypic cultures derived from rat hippocampus and cerebellum. The researchers used the roller-tube technique to culture the explants and injected the fluorescent dye lucifer yellow into the nerve cells. The results demonstrate that cultured neurons grow dendritic arborizations similar to their in situ counterparts, supporting the view that nerve cells show a high degree of differentiation despite an altered biochemical and topographical environment.
