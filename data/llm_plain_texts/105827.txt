tldr: The author, William Hewson and William Hunter, discovered the lymphatic system in fish through vessel injection and dissection. They found that fish have a complex lymphatic system, similar to that of birds and quadrupeds, without lymphatic glands and without valves in the vessels. The lymphatic system in fish plays a crucial role in their physiology and anatomy.
