tldr: The author examines the cerebral commissures in certain Marsupialia and discovers a unique feature in the Diprotodontia, the aberrant bundle. This bundle is found to be a distinctive feature of the Diprotodontia and is linked to the development of the corpus callosum in Eutheria. The author suggests that this commissural arrangement gives Eutheria a significant advantage in brain development and evolution.
