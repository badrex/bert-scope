tldr: The authors investigate the growth of oxide on field-ion specimens of iridium and study the oxidation process and the oxide-metal interface using field-ion microscopy. They find that the oxide films are polycrystalline and the texture depends on the rate of temperature increase. The study provides insights into the nature of the oxide formed on iridium and the structure of the oxide-metal interface.
