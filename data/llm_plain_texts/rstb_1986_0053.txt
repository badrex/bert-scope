tldr: The article presents an experimental study on the ecological interactions between Drosophila hydei and D. melanogaster species. The study reveals various types of interactions and mechanisms that lead to stable coexistence, including resource partitioning and a novel interaction called contramensalism. The findings emphasize the complexity of simple environments and the importance of understanding different stabilizing mechanisms in maintaining coexistence among competing species.
