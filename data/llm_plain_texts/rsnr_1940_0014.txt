tldr: The American Philosophical Society donated $10,000 to the Royal Society during World War II to aid British science and learning. The Royal Society planned to distribute the funds to institutions and agencies where they would be most needed. This generous gift strengthened the bond between the two societies and demonstrated their shared commitment to promoting scientific research and collaboration during challenging times.
