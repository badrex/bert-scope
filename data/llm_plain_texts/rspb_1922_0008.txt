tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the effects of various ions and anions on ciliary movement and cell membrane stability. They found that the presence of magnesium and calcium ions in sea water is necessary for maintaining the semi-permeability of the cell membrane and normal ciliary movement. The study also showed that the toxic effects of pure sodium salts on the cell membrane can be prevented by the presence of alkaline earth metals like magnesium and calcium.
