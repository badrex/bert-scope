tldr: This article discusses the ionosphere's regularities and irregularities, focusing on the solar control of ionization and the absorption of radio waves. The author explains how ionization increases and decreases with the sun's position, mainly due to solar ultra-violet light. The study also investigates the absorption of radio waves in the ionosphere, providing insights into the ionosphere's structure and behavior.
