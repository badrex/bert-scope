tldr: This study investigates the strength and structure of glass, revealing the existence of surface cracks that affect the mechanical strength of the material. The researchers use sodium decoration to observe these cracks and find a correlation between crack frequency and glass weakness. They also discover that the cracks may be related to a tension layer on the glass surface and that the strength of glass is largely dependent on submicroscopic changes in its surface.
