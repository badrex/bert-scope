tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments to study the emission of electrons from metals under the influence of chemical action. They improved the experimental methods, extended the observations, and investigated the effects of various gases on the electron emission from a liquid alloy of sodium and potassium. The results showed that a steady electron emission can be achieved by introducing a large mass of gas into the apparatus, which led to consistent observations and a better understanding of the phenomena.'
