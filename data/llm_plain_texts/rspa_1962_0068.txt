tldr: This study investigates the electrical charging of hail pellets in the presence of polarizing electric fields, which are common in thunderstorms. The authors demonstrate that these fields have little influence on the charging process, as the time of contact between ice crystals and hailstones is shorter than the relaxation time for charge conduction. The research also explores the charging mechanism of hailstones by the accretion, freezing, and bursting of supercooled droplets, and the impact of ice crystals on the undersides of polarized hailstones.
