tldr: 'This study investigates the communication between individuals in salp chains, focusing on the physiology of this process. The research shows that communication occurs through alternating epithelioneural and neuroepithelial chemical synapses, with transmission happening in one direction at one plaque and the reverse direction at the other. The outer skin pulse system plays a crucial role in coordinating locomotor changes in the chain. The study also reveals the pathways by which outer skin pulses spread from one individual to another, providing insights into the mechanisms of communication in salp chains.'
