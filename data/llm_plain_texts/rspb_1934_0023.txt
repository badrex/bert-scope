tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the origin of dust cells in the lungs. They used benzol injections to reduce the number of circulating white blood cells and vital dye injections to mark cells of the reticulo-endothelial system. The results showed that dust cells were derived from the alveolar epithelium, supporting the idea that they play a role in the body's defense against particulate matter.
