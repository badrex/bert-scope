tldr: The authors explore the possibility of the slow or tail component in atmospherics being propagated as a surface wave. They set up solutions for the propagation of electromagnetic waves between conductive layers and find that a solution exists that corresponds to the observed velocities and periods of the slow component. This suggests that the slow component may be a surface wave, providing insight into the mode of propagation and the relationship between the slow and oscillatory components in atmospherics.
