tldr: This study investigates the influence of pressure on the spontaneous ignition of pentane-air mixtures. The authors found that increasing pressure affects the ignition points, with two distinct groups of ignition points identified. The presence of lead tetraethyl can alter these ignition points, which has implications for the phenomenon of "knock" in internal combustion engines.
