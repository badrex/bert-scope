tldr: The authors discovered a highly elastic and resilient diaphragmatic ligament in mammals that helps maintain the diaphragm's optimal operating range, reduces stress on muscle fibers, and assists in shortening the diaphragm muscle during inspiration. This unique ligament has a high elastin content, making it highly elastic and resilient, and plays a crucial role in the mammalian respiratory system.
