tldr: This study examines the self-incompatibility mechanism in Lilium longiflorum, focusing on the role of the pistil in controlling pollen tube growth following cross- and self-pollinations. The researchers found that a stylar fluid containing proteins inhibits pollen tube growth when using protein fractions from'self' styles. They also discuss the potential ways these glycoproteins could control pollen tube elongation and compare their findings to other self-incompatibility systems in angiosperms.
