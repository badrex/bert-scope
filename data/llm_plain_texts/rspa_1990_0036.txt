tldr: The authors develop a semiclassical model to analyze inelastic electron-surface scattering and predict the brightness and shape of surface images in the transmission electron microscope (TEM). The model is used to study transitions between localized surface states and can be extended to cover states that are localized in one dimension. This approach provides a link between the shape of the image and the dependence of scattering probability on impact parameter, offering advantages in spatial resolution and image quality.
