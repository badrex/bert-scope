tldr: This article presents the structure of haemoglobin using Fourier projections on the 010 plane. The authors used the molecular Fourier transform to calculate a Fourier projection of a single row of molecules, which provides a clearer picture of the molecular outline. The results show the advantages of using the molecular Fourier transform as a continuous function of one of the axes, allowing for a better understanding of the haemoglobin molecule's structure.
