tldr: The author discusses the impact of refrigeration and congelation on ocean currents and the Arctic climate. He explains how these processes can cause disturbances in water density, leading to the necessity of currents and counter-currents. The author also highlights the importance of understanding the differences in saline contents of ocean surfaces to determine the influence of currents and counter-currents on the climate of Arctic regions.
