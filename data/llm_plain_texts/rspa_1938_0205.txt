tldr: The authors studied the effect of various solvents on the continuous absorption spectrum of bromine. They found that the ultra-violet absorption of bromine in solution is much more intense than in the gaseous state. The study also showed that the absorption of bromine in different solvents can be affected by the environment, leading to changes in the absorption spectrum. This research helps in understanding the behavior of bromine in different solvents and its potential applications in various fields.
