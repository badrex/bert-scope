tldr: This article discusses the process of determining contemporary stress directions in the lithosphere using neotectonic joint systems. The author explains how neotectonic joints can provide valuable information about the orientations of principal stress axes and how they can be used to infer the stress field in a region. The study focuses on examples from the Ebro basin in Spain and the S. England/N. France region, comparing the directions of greatest horizontal stress inferred from joint systems with those determined from geophysical observations.
