tldr: Dr. Sampson and his colleagues performed an autopsy on a man who had died from an unknown illness. They discovered that the man's internal organs were inverted, with his liver on the left side and his spleen on the right. Despite this unusual condition, the man had not shown any symptoms related to the inversion during his lifetime. The researchers did not find any clear explanation for the inversion or its impact on the man's health.
