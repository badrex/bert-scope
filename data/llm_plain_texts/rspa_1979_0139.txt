tldr: The authors propose a unified nonlinear theory for massless bosons, including photons and gravitons, by using a faithful nonlinear realization of the full little group over the physically observed helicity states. They construct nonlinear transformation laws for the commutator functions and discuss the implications of this theory, including the possibility of investigating nonlinear effects with high-intensity lasers or intense gravitational fields surrounding dense stars.
