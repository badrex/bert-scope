tldr: The article discusses the differential distribution of ions in various cell types of cereal leaves, such as mesophyll, epidermal, and bundle sheath cells. Techniques like X-ray microanalysis, isolation of protoplasts, and single-cell sap sampling were used to measure ion concentrations in these cells. The results indicate that ions like P, Ca2+, and Cl- are differentially distributed between cell types, with mesophyll cells being enriched in P and bundle sheath cells in elements like S and I. The article also highlights the implications of these findings for ion transport pathways and mechanisms in cereal leaves.
