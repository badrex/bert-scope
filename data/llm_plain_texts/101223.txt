tldr: Manfredus Septalius, an Italian virtuoso, shares his observations about finding quicksilver at the roots of plants and shells on in-land mountains. He discovered these phenomena in the Valley of Lancy between the Mountains of Turin. This report discusses similar occurrences in Moravia, Hungary, Peru, and other regions, where mineral juices concreted to plant roots and leaves. The author also mentions finding various types of shells, including Turbinets, Echini, and Pearl-shells, with one containing a pearl.
