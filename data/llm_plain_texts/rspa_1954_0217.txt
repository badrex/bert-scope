tldr: The authors studied the absorption of organic vapors by thin films of nitrocellulose and measured the vapor-pressure isotherms with various solvents. They found that nitrocellulose's solubility depends on specific interactions with solvents containing polar groups, such as carboxylate esters and ketones. The results provide insights into the solution thermodynamics of high polymers and help understand the solubility and interactions of nitrocellulose with different solvents.
