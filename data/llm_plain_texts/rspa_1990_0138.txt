tldr: The author demonstrates a property of non-singular second-order tensors, showing that there exists at least one special circle of directions for which the corresponding vectors also lie on a circle. This property is applicable to various fields, including electromagnetism, thermal conduction, and mechanics. The number of special circles depends on the shape of the ellipsoid associated with the tensor.
