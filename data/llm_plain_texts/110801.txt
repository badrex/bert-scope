tldr: The author conducted research on the decomposition and disintegration of phosphatic vesical calculi using weak solutions of lead supersalts, such as the supermalate, saccharate, lactate, and nitro-saccharate. These solutions were introduced into the living bladder without causing irritation or inconvenience, establishing the principle of chemical decomposition of phosphatic calculi using mild solutions.
