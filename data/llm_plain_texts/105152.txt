tldr: The author, T. Melvil, discusses the cause of the different refrangibility of light rays. He proposes an experiment to determine the velocity of light and suggests that the different colors of light have different velocities. This theory explains the phenomenon of color dispersion in prisms and the color changes observed in astronomical objects like Jupiter's satellites.
