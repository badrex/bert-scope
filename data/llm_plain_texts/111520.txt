tldr: This study investigates the composition of various animals, such as oxen, sheep, and pigs, that are consumed as human food. The authors analyze the animals' carcasses and offal parts to determine the amounts of water, mineral matter, nitrogenous compounds, fat, and total dry substance. They find that the proportion of fat increases as the animals mature, while the proportion of nitrogenous compounds and mineral matter decreases. The study also estimates the composition of the increase gained during the fattening process for different types of animals.
