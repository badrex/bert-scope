tldr: The article investigates the spontaneous magnetization of the triangular lattice Ising model with triplet interactions. It shows that the magnetization function is a solution of Legendre's modular equation of degree 3 and can be expressed explicitly in terms of an algebraic hypergeometric function. The study also reveals the behavior of the magnetization near the critical point and non-physical singularities.
