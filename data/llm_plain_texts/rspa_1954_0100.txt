tldr: This article discusses the valence bond theory of molecular structure, focusing on orbital theories and the valence-bond method. It compares the molecular orbital and valence bond approaches, highlighting their similarities and differences. The author aims to reformulate the valence bond theory to make it more mathematically tractable and non-empirical, providing a unified description of chemical bonding and a general method of defining bond order.
