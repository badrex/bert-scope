tldr: 'The authors calculate the rate of energy dissipation at spring tides in the Irish Sea using skin friction and riverbed friction formulas. They find that the dissipation rate is 1,530 ergs per square centimeter per second, which is sufficient to reduce the amplitude of the incoming tidal wave to half, absorbing three-quarters of its energy. This absorption explains the characteristics of tidal phenomena in the South Channel of the Irish Sea, such as the velocity of the cotidal line and the effects of Carnsore Point and Wicklow Head on high water times.'
