tldr: The article discusses the bacterial phosphotransferase system (PTS), which is a major transport system for many carbohydrates. The system consists of two general proteins, enzyme I and histidine protein (HPr), and a series of substrate-specific enzymes II (EII). The article compares the DNA and amino acid sequences of these transport molecules, providing insights into their structures, homologies, and functional domains. The PTS plays a crucial role in cellular adaptation processes, including chemotaxis and regulation of peripheral catabolic pathways.
