tldr: This article explores the role of neurotrophins, specifically nerve growth factor (NGF), in the development, maintenance, and injury of sensory neurons. It discusses the impact of NGF on peripheral neuropathies, such as diabetic neuropathy and leprosy neuropathy, and suggests that NGF may provide a potential treatment for these conditions. The article also highlights the importance of understanding neurotrophic mechanisms in the regulation of nociception and the prevention of complications like skin ulceration.
