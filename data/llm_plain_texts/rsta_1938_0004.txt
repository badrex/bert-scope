tldr: 'This article presents a method for computing Fermi-Dirac functions, which are essential for understanding the behavior of particles in statistical mechanics and quantum mechanics. The authors provide tables of these functions and discuss their applications in various fields, including solid-state physics, astrophysics, and the study of metals. They also compare Fermi-Dirac functions to Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics and demonstrate how the two are related.'
