tldr: The author, James R. Christie, explores the use of the barometric thermometer for determining relative heights and discusses its advantages over traditional barometers. He also presents a formula for calculating the height difference between two stations using the barometric pressure and temperature. The author's experiments show that the accuracy of the barometric thermometer can be improved by considering the instrumental error and applying corrections to the observations.
