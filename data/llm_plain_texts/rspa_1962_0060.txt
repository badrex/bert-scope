tldr: The authors conducted a rotational analysis of the 2491 electronic transition of nitrogen dioxide. They found that the upper state belongs to the point group and electronic symmetry with an N-O length of and an ONO angle. This analysis provides insight into the structure and properties of nitrogen dioxide, a gaseous 17-electron triatomic molecule.
