tldr: This study examines the effects of oil refinery and platform discharges on the meiobenthos of the North Sea. The research investigates two field investigations, one examining the impact of an oil refinery discharge on intertidal meiofauna in the Firth of Forth, and the other studying the effects of oil platform discharges on surrounding meiobenthos. The results show that hydrocarbon discharges have limited damage to meiofaunal communities, with some improvements observed in meiofaunal densities over time due to changes in drilling muds.
