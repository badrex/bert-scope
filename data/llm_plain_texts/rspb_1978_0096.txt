tldr: The authors re-examined the action of curare on the motor endplate and found that it has an additional 'non-competitive' blocking action, which affects the endplate channels' lifetime. This action is not due to competitive receptor binding and is similar to the action of other non-competitive blocking drugs. The study provides insights into the mechanism of curare action and its effects on neuromuscular blocking agents.
