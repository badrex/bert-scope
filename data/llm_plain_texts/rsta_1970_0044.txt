tldr: The Red Sea and Gulf of Aden's development is explained through the lens of plate tectonics. The motion of at least four plates, Arabia, the northwest Indian Ocean, Africa east of the rift, and Africa west of the rift, contributes to the evolution of these regions. The study highlights the importance of understanding the interactions between these plates and their impact on the Earth's crust and seismic activity.
