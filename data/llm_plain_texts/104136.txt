tldr: In a letter to Peter Collinson, Benj. Cooke describes a fire-ball observed on December 11, 1741. The fire-ball had a conical shape, was about 30 feet above the ground, and moved from southwest to northeast without any noise, wind, or motion of the Earth. The author seeks more information about this phenomenon and its possible explanations.
