tldr: The author, William Crookes, conducted experiments to identify the element responsible for a double orange band spectrum observed in radiant matter spectroscopy. Through a series of laborious chemical processes, he discovered that the element was samarium, a rare earth element found in a mixture with didymia. This research expanded the understanding of spectroscopy and the chemistry of trace elements.
