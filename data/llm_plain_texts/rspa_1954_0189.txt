tldr: The article presents a macroscopic theory of interference and diffraction of light from finite sources with a narrow spectral range. It formulates a generalized Huygens principle that expresses the intensity at a point in the field as an integral over a surface, involving the intensity distribution and a correlation factor called the degree of coherence. This principle involves observable quantities and can be applied to various optical problems and other types of radiation.
