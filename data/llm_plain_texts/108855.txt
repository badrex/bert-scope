tldr: The author examines the distribution of nerves in the muscular fibers of frogs, specifically the pectoral muscle. They observe that the dark-bordered fibers, which are part of the neuromuscular system, branch out and subdivide, providing a network of nerves to the elementary muscle fibers. This challenges the common belief that nerves only end in free ends or terminate at specific points in the muscle fibers.
