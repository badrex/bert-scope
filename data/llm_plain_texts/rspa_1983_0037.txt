tldr: The authors conducted an experiment to detect the acoustic wave radiated by the head-on collision of two vortex rings. They compared the detected wave profile with predictions from the inviscid theory and found that it did not accurately predict the observed profile. Therefore, they developed a new theory that takes into account the effect of fluid viscosity to better fit the observed data.
