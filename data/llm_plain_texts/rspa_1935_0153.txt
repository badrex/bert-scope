tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the viscosity of liquid helium between 4.2K and 2.0K. They discovered a significant change in viscosity at 2.19K, the temperature at which helium transitions from state I to state II. This finding suggests that the difference between these two liquid states is related to the arrangement of atoms.
