tldr: The authors conducted experiments using electric currents to investigate the properties of soap films and their resistance. They aimed to obtain evidence about the radius of molecular attraction and improve upon previous experiments by various physicists. The study also focused on understanding the changes in the constitution of soap films due to hygrometric conditions and the specific resistance of soap films.
