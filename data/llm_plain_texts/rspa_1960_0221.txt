tldr: The authors studied the infra-red spectra of surface species formed by the initial chemisorption of acetylene and ethylene on silica-supported metals like palladium, copper, and nickel. They found that the surface species derived from acetylene on palladium and copper were olefinic in type, while those from ethylene on palladium were predominantly olefinic but also contained some saturated groupings. The results provide insights into the structure of adsorbed molecules and help understand reactions like metal-catalyzed hydrogenation of ethylene.
