tldr: The authors develop a formula for the thermodynamic properties of mixtures with non-zero energies of mixing, using a method called quasi-chemical equilibrium. They apply this to binary mixtures and show that the resulting thermodynamic functions are similar to those of regular mixtures, where each molecule occupies a single site. This work helps to understand the behavior of complex mixtures and their potential energy.
