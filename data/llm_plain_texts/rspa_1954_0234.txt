tldr: This article discusses the thermodynamic theory of the second viscosity in fluids, focusing on the relationship between the Navier-Stokes equations and the thermodynamic theory of relaxation. The author explores the use of internal variables to represent the internal mechanisms in isotropic substances and how these variables can be used to understand the behavior of fluids with after-effects.
