tldr: The authors conducted experiments on locusts to study the neural mechanisms underlying learning. They used a computer-controlled training procedure to raise or lower the mean frequency of discharge of the anterior adductor coxa motoneurone. Intracellular recordings from the motoneurone's soma showed that a stable increase in the mean frequency of the pacemaker occurred during up-learning and a decrease during down-learning. The pacemaker shift accounted for over half the overall learning change, with the remaining changes attributed to modifications in the activities of interneurones that directly or indirectly affect the motoneurone pacemaker.
