tldr: The authors studied the effect of various gases on the decomposition of cyclobutane, a chemical reaction that occurs in the gas phase. They found that certain gases, like hydrogen, can help maintain the rate of the reaction by reducing the impact of low-pressure conditions. The results provide insights into the role of collisional deactivation in the reaction process.
