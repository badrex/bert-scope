tldr: The author examines the dimensions of megalithic sites and their potential connection to a quantum of 5.44 ft. Using a Fourier analysis, the author tests for the presence of this quantum in circle-diameters from various sites. While the sample size is small, the study raises questions about the use of a standard unit of length in ancient construction and the possibility of a quantum effect in the measurements.
