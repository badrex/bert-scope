tldr: This article discusses the importance of evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) models in understanding biological signaling systems. The authors explore the consequences of uncertainty in perception in a model of signaling during mate choice and present numerical results that demonstrate the impact of error-prone perception on the evolution of signaling strategies. They emphasize the need for further development of signaling theory to better understand complex communication systems in animals.
