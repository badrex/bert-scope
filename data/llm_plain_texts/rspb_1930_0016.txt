tldr: The study investigates the production of lactic acid in desiccated amphibian muscles and finds that simple drying causes the same amount of lactic acid production as freezing. The research confirms that the effects of freezing and drying are identical, with the main factor being the removal of water from the muscle. The findings suggest that the formation of lactic acid in frozen muscle is due to the removal of water and this factor alone.
