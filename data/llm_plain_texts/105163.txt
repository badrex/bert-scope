tldr: 'James Simon, a member of the Incorporated Society at Dublin, recorded daily barometer readings and weather observations from March 7, 1752, to February 28, 1753. He sought feedback on his detailed journal, which he believed could be useful for the Royal Society. Simon also mentioned his preference for a larger barometer tube to reduce friction and improve accuracy in weather observation.'
