tldr: The authors isolated chloroplasts from plants and found that they contain two types of cytochromes, b6 and f, which play a crucial role in photosynthesis. These cytochromes are located in the grana of the chloroplasts and work together with chlorophyll to facilitate the electron transport system, which is essential for photosynthesis.
