tldr: This study investigates the role of neuraminidase in reducing the resistance of gonococci in urethral exudates to human serum. The researchers found that treating gonococci with neuraminidase significantly reduced their serum resistance, suggesting that sialylation of lipopolysaccharide by host factors may play a role in the bacteria's ability to evade the immune system.
