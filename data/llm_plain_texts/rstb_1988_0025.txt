tldr: This article examines the evolution of climatic variability in the North Atlantic region over the past three million years, focusing on vegetational changes in northwest Europe, particularly in the Netherlands. The authors discuss the limitations of pollen analysis data and its role in reconstructing past vegetation. They also present a climate curve and chronostratigraphy for the Quaternary period in the Netherlands, highlighting the alternation of temperate and cold stages since around 2.4 million years ago.
