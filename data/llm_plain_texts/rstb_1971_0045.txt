tldr: This article discusses new developments in electron microscopy, focusing on observing unstained macromolecules without appositional contrast. The author explains the use of bright- and dark-field microscopy techniques and the importance of thin carbon support films for imaging unstained biological macromolecules. The methods are demonstrated through various examples, including DNA-protein monolayers and ferritin molecules.
