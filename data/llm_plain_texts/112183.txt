tldr: The author, A. Matthiessen, conducted experiments to determine the coefficient of expansion of mercury and water. They found that the expansion of water and mercury was different than previously thought, and that Kopp's values for water expansion might be incorrect. This research was important for understanding the properties of fluids and their behavior under different temperatures.
