tldr: The author discusses the statistical and thermodynamical relations of radiant energy, focusing on the Boltzmann distribution and the concept of entropy. They explore the connection between molecular distribution, probability, and the tendency of systems to reach equilibrium. The author also extends the idea of entropy to systems not in statistical equilibrium, such as those with different temperatures.
