tldr: The authors used the marker-and-cell technique to study the disintegration of a liquid drop in an electric field. They found that the spheroidal assumption provides an accurate representation of the drop's shape, and the calculated distribution of pressure and fluid velocities match experimental measurements. The results provide a better understanding of the dynamics of drop disintegration and its implications in cloud physics.
