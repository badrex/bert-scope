tldr: This study compares the transmission of beet mosaic and beet yellows viruses by aphids, focusing on their behavior as non-persistent and persistent viruses. The research shows that beet mosaic virus is non-persistent, while beet yellows virus is persistent. The main difference between the two types lies in the effect of preliminary fasting on their infectivity. Both viruses share the same vector, Myzus persicae, but have different host plants and properties, indicating that the differences in their behavior are due to the viruses themselves.
