tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effect of various liquids on the growth of peas, barley, wheat, and oats. He observed that some liquids, like alum water, hindered growth, while others, like urine, seemed to help. The author also noticed that some plants grew better when planted at a certain distance from each other, suggesting that soil fertility and spacing play a role in plant growth.
