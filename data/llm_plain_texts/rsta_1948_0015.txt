tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the detonation behavior of lead azide when wetted with various liquids. They found that lead azide will detonate only when the grains are surrounded by gas or vapor. The study supports the view that the normal mechanism of detonation of lead azide is controlled by mass flow rather than self-heating.
