tldr: 'The author investigates the upper limit of energy in the spectrum of radium E using the cloud expansion method. They find that the radium E spectrum does not have a defined end-point at 5000 Hp and there is evidence of particles emitted with an energy of around 3,000,000 electron volts (corresponding to 12,000 Hp). This challenges previous work and suggests that the distribution curve may not have a sharply defined end point.'
