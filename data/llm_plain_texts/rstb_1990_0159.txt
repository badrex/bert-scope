tldr: This article explores the spatial memory and food-storing behavior of birds, specifically focusing on parids (tits and chickadees) and corvids. It discusses how these birds use memory to recover stored food and how this memory can be tested in tasks that do not involve food storing. The article also compares the memory of storing birds with that of their non-storing relatives in various tasks and examines the importance of memory in a food-storing way of life.
