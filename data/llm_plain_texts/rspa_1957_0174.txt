tldr: The authors conducted an X-ray crystallography study on four different crystal structures of vitamin B12 to determine its molecular structure. They identified a nucleotide-like group and a nucleus surrounding the cobalt atom, which helped in refining the electron density distributions and establishing the arrangement of atoms in the molecule. The findings provide insights into the chemical structure and stereochemistry of vitamin B12, revealing its relation to porphyrins and porphobilinogen.
