tldr: The authors explain how the visual system can interpret a moving retinal image by resolving the optic flow field into rotational and translational components. They demonstrate that the translational component can be used to determine the direction of motion and the relative depths of elements in a rigid scene, while the rotational component is independent of the scene's structure.
