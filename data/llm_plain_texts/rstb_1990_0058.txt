tldr: The authors analyzed sediment profiles from five Scandinavian SWAP sites for 210Pb using isotope dilution alpha spectrometry. The results showed that the 210Pb parameters were similar to protected forest lakes with no land-use activities, indicating almost exclusive atmospheric inputs. The sediment accumulation rates increased over the past century, but 210Pb parameters did not show strong signs of enhanced land-use activities. This may be due to more efficient preservation of sediments under more acidic conditions.
