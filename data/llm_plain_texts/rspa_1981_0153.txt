tldr: This article presents a new method to combine the governing equations of thermohaline convection, leading to bounds for the complex growth rate of an arbitrary oscillatory perturbation. The analysis applies to both rotatory thermal and rotatory thermohaline convections, providing bounds for different configurations and combinations of dynamically free and rigid boundaries.
