tldr: The author presents a method for comparing human skulls, specifically Homo sapiens and Homo neandertalensis, by analyzing their sagittal sections. The study reveals differences in the shape and size of the skulls, with Homo neandertalensis having larger nasion angles than Homo sapiens. This method can be used to better understand the differences between these two species and their evolutionary relationships.
