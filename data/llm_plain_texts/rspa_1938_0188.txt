tldr: The authors calculate the perturbation of the rotational levels of the methane molecule's fundamental vibration caused by the Coriolis term in the Hamiltonian. They use vibrational-rotational wave functions to determine the effects of the Coriolis coupling term on the energy spectrum, which is essential for understanding the complex rotational structure of the methane molecule's infrared absorption band.
