tldr: The authors used the pulsed field method to study the de Haas-van Alphen effect in rhodium and successfully separated and measured various frequencies. They identified several separate sheets of the Fermi surface and compared their dimensions with a predicted Fermi surface based on the band structure of rhodium. The study explains the observed frequencies and provides insights into the behavior of transverse magnetoresistance in rhodium.
