tldr: This article presents new experiments on the changes in dimensions of rings and rods of iron and other metals when magnetized. The author uses rings to address previous objections and finds that the phenomena of elongation and retraction are consistent with previous findings. The study also includes experiments with cobalt, nickel, manganese-steel, and bismuth, and suggests that some metals may behave similarly to iron under high magnetizing forces.
