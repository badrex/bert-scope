tldr: This study measures the heat capacities of plutonium and neptunium at low temperatures using improved adiabatic and transient measurement techniques. The results show that the electronic heat capacities of both elements are high and increase with atomic number. The findings contribute to understanding the behavior of actinides in the temperature range of 4 to 300 K and provide more accurate data for further research in low-temperature physics.
