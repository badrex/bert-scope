tldr: This study investigates the Tertiary sediments at St Agnes, Crousa Downs, and Polcrebo Downs in Cornwall, providing detailed descriptions of the deposits and their stratigraphy. The authors distinguish two discrete outliers at St Agnes and propose a tripartite stratigraphy for one of them. They also redefine and term the Reskajeage Surface, which has important implications for understanding the geomorphological evolution of Oldland Britain. The findings have significant consequences for interpreting landscape evolution in other areas of western Europe with undated Tertiary deposits.
