tldr: This study investigates the He I and He II photoelectron spectra of lanthanide trichlorides in the vapour phase, providing insights into their electronic structure and bonding. The spectra reveal marked similarities between the He I and He II ionizations, with features assigned mainly to halogen-localized ionizations. The observed intensity changes between the He I and He II spectra suggest orbital mixing between vacant metal orbitals and ligand-localized valence molecular orbitals. The findings support the atomic nature of the 4f shell and indicate that the partial ionization cross-section falls rapidly across the lanthanide series.
