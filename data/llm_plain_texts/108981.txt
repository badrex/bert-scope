tldr: The author conducted a series of experiments to measure the chemical intensity of total daylight at Kew Observatory and compared it to observations at Pará. They found that the chemical intensity varies with the sun's altitude and the amount of cloud cover. The author also discovered a relationship between the sun's altitude and the chemical intensity, which can be used to calculate the intensity at noon based on morning and afternoon observations.
