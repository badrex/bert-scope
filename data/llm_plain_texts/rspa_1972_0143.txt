tldr: The article discusses the magnetic resonance of a spin-assembly with aligned spins, focusing on the equations of motion and resonance functions. The authors introduce a phenomenological approach to include anisotropic damping and axial symmetry, leading to a set of equations that reduce to the Bloch equations for isotropic relaxation. The study provides insights into the behavior of spin-assemblies in magnetic resonance without necessarily having a net magnetization.
