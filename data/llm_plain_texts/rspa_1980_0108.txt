tldr: The article presents a formalism of relativistic convective differentiation to relate the equations of motion to the rheometric structure of a continuous medium. The author applies this formalism to an ideal electrodynamic medium, demonstrating that the resulting theory can be given a variational form. The theory is useful for describing the mechanics of continuous media, particularly in the context of perfect electromagnetic media and the detection of gravitational waves.
