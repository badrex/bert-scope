tldr: The authors present a method for determining the stability of general static capillary surfaces, focusing on liquid bridges with fixed contact lines under gravity. They use a preferred bifurcation diagram method, which is based on properties of the Jacobi equation, to analyze the stability of various equilibria and provide a classification system for capillary surfaces. This approach can be applied to other capillary surfaces, such as drops and non-axisymmetric shapes.
