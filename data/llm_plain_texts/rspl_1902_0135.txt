tldr: The author investigates skew refraction through lenses and the formation of a hollow pencil given by an annulus of a lens placed at a large obliquity. They develop a method for calculating the direction-cosines of refracted rays and apply it to a specific case of a thin annulus of a plano-convex lens. The author discovers the primary and secondary focal lines and explains the formation of the hollow pencil as an inverted image due to the up-and-down and left-and-right inversions of the rays.
