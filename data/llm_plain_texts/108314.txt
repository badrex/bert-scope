tldr: The author, James D. Forbes, conducted experiments on the flow of plastic bodies and observed the phenomena of lava streams to understand the movement of glaciers. He discovered that the veined structure of glaciers, which forms due to differential motion and friction, is similar to the structure found in lava streams. This research helped explain the behavior of glaciers and their movement patterns.
