tldr: This article discusses the discovery of well-preserved fossils from the Upper Permian of Madagascar that are structurally intermediate between primitive diapsid reptiles and nothosaurs and plesiosaurs. The fossils, including Thadeosaurus and Claudiosaurus, show basic anatomy similar to eosuchian reptiles but also exhibit characteristics of sauropterygian reptiles, suggesting a shift to aquatic feeding habits. The article highlights the importance of these fossils in understanding the ancestry of nothosaurs and plesiosaurs, which has been a topic of continuing dispute among scientists.
