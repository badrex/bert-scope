tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments to study the photo-disintegration of deuterium using a radiothorium source. They measured the range and angle of projection for the protons produced and determined the binding energy of the deuterium. The results indicated a considerable preponderance of the photoelectric type of disintegration and provided a value for the mass of the neutron.'
