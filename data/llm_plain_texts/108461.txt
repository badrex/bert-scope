tldr: The author investigates the chemical changes and differences between elemental particles during chemical reactions. They propose that a chemical difference exists between the particles of certain elemental bodies, similar to the differences between particles of compound substances. This chemical difference is an essential condition of both decomposition and composition of the body, and is related to the concept of chemical polarization.
