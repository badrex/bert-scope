tldr: The author presents a new method for approximating elliptic and ultra-elliptic functions using geometric means between arithmetic and harmonic means. This method is applicable to functions with square root radicals and can be used to approximate integrals of these functions. The author claims that this method is simpler and more efficient than using Jacobi's functions or computing tables of auxiliary functions.
