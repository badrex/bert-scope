tldr: This article investigates the three-dimensional deflected configuration of a slender elastic rod with a uniform circular cross-section under parallel terminal forces and moments. The authors establish nonlinear equilibrium equations for the rod in a Cartesian coordinate system and provide an analytical solution without linearization, applicable for large nonlinear elastic deformations.
