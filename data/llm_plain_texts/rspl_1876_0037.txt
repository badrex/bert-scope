tldr: The author investigates organoboron compounds and their reactions, including the synthesis of boric diethethylate and boric diethohydrate. They describe the properties and reactions of these compounds, such as their flammability, density, and decomposition when exposed to water. The author also mentions the possibility of a pentadic condition of the boron atom, similar to nitrogen, phosphorus, and arsenic.
