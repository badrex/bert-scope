tldr: This article investigates the role of radiation in the cooling process of a gaseous explosion. The author conducted experiments using a silver-lined vessel to study the effect of walls reflecting radiation. The results showed that radiation plays a significant role in the cooling process, with approximately one-third of the heat loss due to radiation during the first quarter of a second after the explosion.
