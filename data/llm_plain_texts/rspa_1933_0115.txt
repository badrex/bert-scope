tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the adsorption of iodine by potassium iodide. They found evidence for the existence of a bimolecular layer of iodine on potassium iodide crystals at saturation pressure. They also proposed an isotherm that fits the experimental results over the whole range of pressure. This research contributes to the understanding of surface chemistry and adsorption processes.
