semantic_tags:
  - Electron resonance
  - Molecular interactions
  - Spin-orbit coupling
  - Hyperfine structure
  - Sulfur monoxide
tldr: The authors studied the electron resonance spectrum of sulfur monoxide (SO) in the gas phase and analyzed the interactions between the unpaired electronic spins, electronic orbital angular momentum, and rotationally induced magnetic moments. They determined the values of parameters measuring these interactions and resolved the first and second-order contributions to the zero-field molecular constants. Additionally, they observed and analyzed the hyperfine structure resulting from the presence of silicon-29 in the sample.
