tldr: The author presents a graphical method for calculating trajectories of high-angle fire, taking into account the variation of air density along the trajectory. The method involves using time-velocity and time-height curves to determine the elements of a trajectory, such as the range, time of flight, and direction of motion. The author demonstrates the method with an example of a shell fired from a 6-inch gun, showing the agreement between the calculated and observed results.
