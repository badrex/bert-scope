tldr: The authors analyzed the absorption spectrum of gaseous BiO, focusing on the rotational structure of its bands. They discovered unusual features in the bands, which they attributed to unresolved nuclear magnetic hyperfine doubling in the ground state. This study provides a detailed interpretation of the magnetic hyperfine interactions in diatomic molecules, with implications for understanding electronic states and transitions involving case states.
