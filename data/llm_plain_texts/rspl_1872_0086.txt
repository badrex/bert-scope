tldr: The author explains how the eye accommodates for near and far vision through the interaction of the ciliary muscle, ciliary processes, and iris. The ciliary muscle compresses the veins in the ciliary processes, causing them to expand and change the shape of the lens for near vision. The iris also aids in accommodation by adjusting the plane of its opening, allowing for faster changes in focus.
