tldr: This article responds to criticisms of a previous study on predator deterrence and boldness in guppies. The authors argue that their experimental methods are sound and provide additional data to support their original findings. They discuss the potential mechanisms behind predator inspection behavior and its role in deterring predators. The authors also address specific criticisms of their first experiment and present a new experiment to further test their hypothesis.
