tldr: The author, Morris W. Travers, conducted experiments to study the absorption of water by cotton and wool. He found that the absorption of water vapour by these materials could be explained by the formation of solid solutions. The results showed that the curves for water-cotton and water-wool systems did not exhibit a tendency to bend to the right, unlike the curves for the results of Professor Trouton's experiments.
