tldr: The authors studied the oxidation of diborane through two experimental methods: conventional furnace-heated vessels and flash photolysis. They discovered that degenerately branching chains are involved in the oxidation process. The hydroxyl radical plays a significant role in the reactions. The findings provide insights into the combustion of diborane and its comparison with hydrogen and hydrocarbon oxidations.
