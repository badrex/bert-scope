tldr: The spin-coupled valence bond theory is developed as a powerful alternative to molecular orbital configuration interaction (MOCI) calculations. The theory reformulates the single configuration spin-coupled theory to yield both ground and excited orbitals. It is applied to the states of molecules, showing very good convergence for the lowest six states and providing a total energy of the ground state below that given by a large MOCI calculation. This theory offers a flexible and efficient approach to understanding molecular electronic structure.
