tldr: This article presents an experimental study of the absorption of high-energy photons in various materials, including hydrogen, carbon, copper, silver, lead, and uranium. The authors used the Oxford synchrotron to measure the total absorption cross-sections and tested the accuracy of the Born approximation in the theory of pair production. The results provide a more precise understanding of the interaction of high-energy photons with matter and help improve the accuracy of theoretical calculations.
