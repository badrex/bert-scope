tldr: 'In a letter to the Royal Society, Abraham Trembley describes an earthquake experienced in Colen, Liege, Maestricht, and the surrounding areas on November 19, 1756. The earthquake was also felt in Portugal. Trembley discusses the different sensations people experienced during the earthquake and mentions previous earthquakes in the region. He leaves it to the Royal Society to decide if this information is worth sharing.'
