tldr: The authors develop a model to determine the pore-size distributions and pore-space interconnectivity of Vycor porous glass using adsorption-desorption hysteresis capillary condensation isotherms. They use a Bethe tree as the network of pore connections and analyze capillary condensation adsorption and desorption scanning curves. The results provide an estimate of the cavity-size distribution, window-size distribution, and the number of windows per cavity, enabling the calculation of geometric pore sizes from the Kelvin pore sizes.
