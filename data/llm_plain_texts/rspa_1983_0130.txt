revised_title: 'Thermal Explosions, Criticality, and the Disappearance of Criticality in Systems with Distributed Temperatures: Arbitrary Biot Number and General Reaction-Rate Laws'

tldr: The authors study thermal explosions in systems with distributed temperatures, focusing on the Biot number and general reaction-rate laws. They evaluate critical values for the parameter and the dimensionless central-temperature excess for the whole range of Biot numbers, from the uniform case to the Frank-Kamenetskii extreme. The results are applicable to various temperature-dependence of reaction rates and are compared with earlier work.
