tldr: James Watt developed a new method to prepare a test liquor using red cabbage to detect the presence of acids and alkalies in chemical mixtures. The test is more sensitive and accurate than previous methods, such as the infusion of litmus or syrop of violets. The red cabbage test is natural, easy to perform, and can be used to identify the exact point of saturation of acids and alkalies.
