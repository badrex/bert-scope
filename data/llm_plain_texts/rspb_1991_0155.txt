tldr: The authors analyzed the water-soluble peridinin-chlorophyll a proteins (sPCP) from three symbiotic dinoflagellates, finding differences in their quaternary structure and spectroscopic characteristics. They discovered that the spectroscopic properties of sPCP depend on the apoprotein's structure and that two distinct forms of chlorophyll a are present in each holoprotein. This study provides insights into the molecular topologies of sPCP and their role in light-harvesting and energy transfer in dinoflagellates.
