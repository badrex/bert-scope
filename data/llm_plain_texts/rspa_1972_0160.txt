tldr: The author presents a method for solving free boundary problems, focusing on the singularity at the separation point. They use complex variable techniques and numerical methods to improve the accuracy of the finite-difference solution near the singularity. The study is applied to a specific free boundary problem involving fluid percolation through a porous dam, providing numerical results for comparison.
