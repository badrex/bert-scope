tldr: The authors present a general method for solving the field equations inside ferromagnetic sheets subjected to alternating magnetization. They consider the fundamental and third harmonic components and develop a systematic iterative scheme to find the phasors at the center of the sheet, satisfying the prescribed values at the surface. This method accounts for the inherent distortions of the magnetic field and current density inside the saturated material, providing a more accurate evaluation of core loss in thin laminations.
