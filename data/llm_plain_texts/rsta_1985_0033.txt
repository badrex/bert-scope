tldr: This study evaluates the stages, kinetics, and indices of petroleum generation using hydrous pyrolysis experimentation on Woodford Shale and Phosphoria Retort Shale. The research identifies four distinct stages of pyrolysate generation and provides kinetic data on the overall reaction involving the generation of expelled oil. The results show differences in activation energy and pre-exponential factors between the two rock types, which can be crucial in evaluating the petroleum potential of shallow and deep basins.
