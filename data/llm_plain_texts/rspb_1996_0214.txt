  - Ancient DNA
  - Cattle domestication
  - Evolutionary biology
  - Mitochondrial DNA

tldr: 'The study of ancient DNA from European cattle bones reveals that they expanded from a diverse wild progenitor species. The analysis of mitochondrial DNA control region sequences from various archaeological samples suggests that modern European cattle are derived from a recent population expansion and still retain some Pleistocene genetic diversity.'
