tldr: The study demonstrates that female abdominal spines in water striders function to increase female control over copulation. By experimentally extending the phenotypic size range of these spines, it was found that this morphological adaptation allows females to thwart harassing males and reduce the frequency of costly matings. This shows the coevolutionary nature of sexual conflict and highlights that females are active participants in the battle for control of reproduction.
