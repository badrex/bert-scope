tldr: The author presents a method for continuously tuning diaphragms in submarine sound-generators and receivers, allowing for selective transmission and reception of signals. The diaphragm's fundamental pitch can be raised or lowered by altering gaseous pressure, increasing the efficiency and sensitivity of the sound-generating and receiving apparatus.
