tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the occlusion of hydrogen and oxygen by palladium. They found that palladium black, sponge, and foil have different properties in terms of hydrogen and oxygen absorption. The study provides insights into the nature of occlusion and the behavior of palladium with different gases, which can be useful for further research and applications in chemistry.
