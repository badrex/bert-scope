tldr: The author presents new proofs for the existence, uniqueness, and covering radius of the Leech lattice, an even 24-dimensional unimodular lattice. The paper also provides a uniform proof that the 23 "holy constructions" of the Leech lattice work. The Leech lattice is a significant mathematical structure with applications in various fields, including geometry, number theory, and mathematical physics.
