tldr: The authors studied the fine structure of the thalamic relay nuclei in the cat using electron microscopy, focusing on synaptic glomeruli. They found that these structures contain different types of axon terminals and dendrites, which play a crucial role in complex synaptic interactions. This research provides insights into the complex organization of the thalamus and its role in sensory processing.
