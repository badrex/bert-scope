tldr: The study investigates the structure and composition of the shell of the living brachiopod Lingula, revealing a complex and unique exoskeleton made of collagen, chitin, glycosaminoglycans, and apatite. The shell's intricate structure and composition provide insights into the evolution and phylogeny of brachiopods, as well as their relationship with other organisms.
