tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the catalytic activity of solid surfaces, particularly nickel, and how it is affected by impurities and catalyst poisoning. They found that the activity of a catalyst is a function of individual atoms or particles, and that inactivation occurs when active particles are covered or transformed by impurities. The authors also proposed a new theory of how catalytic activity occurs, involving the detachment of nickel atoms from their neighbors during the chemical change.
