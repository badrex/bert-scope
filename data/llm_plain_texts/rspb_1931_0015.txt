tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the effects of antidromic volleys on reflex responses in the flexor reflex. They discovered that antidromic impulses in motor nerve fibers can block reflex discharge for a short period, affecting the latent period and the reflex response. This study provides insights into the complex interactions between nerve impulses and the nervous system.
