tldr: The authors conducted an X-ray study on isomorphous organometallic compounds, specifically the tetraphenyls of carbon, silicon, germanium, tin, and lead. They found that these compounds form mixed crystals and are strictly isomorphous. The study provides crystallographic data and discusses the effect of the grouping element on the intensity of reflected X-rays.
