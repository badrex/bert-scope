tldr: The author presents corrections and additions to a previous memoir on the theory of reciprocal surfaces. They discuss the off-points and off-planes, explaining that they are real singularities but not the singularities referred to in the formulae. The author also corrects errors in the coefficients of some formulae and provides new equations involving the spinode curve. Additionally, they address inconsistencies in the values of certain coefficients and discuss the coefficients of the terms in the surface.
