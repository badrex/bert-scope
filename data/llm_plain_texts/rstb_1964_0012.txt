tldr: This study investigates the embryonic development and organogeny of the flour beetle, Tenebrio molitor. It focuses on the origin, structure, and segmentation of the mesoderm, as well as the formation and breakdown of coelomic sacs. The research provides a detailed description of the early development stages and offers insights into the beetle's unspecialized nature, which may have exopterygote affinities.
