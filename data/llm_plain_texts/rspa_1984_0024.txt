revised_title: Angle-Dependent Ion Kinetic Energy Spectra in Mass Spectrometry: Theoretical Analysis of Conservation Laws
semantic_tags:
  - Mass spectrometry
  - Ion collisions
  - Collision-induced processes
  - Kinetic energy spectra
  - Conservation laws
tldr: The authors examine the angle-dependence of ion kinetic energy spectra in mass spectrometry, focusing on the theoretical consequences of conservation laws for collisions. They explore the implications of energy and linear momentum conservation in ion-neutral collisions, providing a review of the extensive work on monatomic projectiles and targets and extending these results to polyatomic species relevant to mass spectrometrists.
