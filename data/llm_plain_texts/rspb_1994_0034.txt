tldr: This study on ring-necked pheasants shows that younger males have less exaggerated ornaments than older males, and females pay less attention to condition-dependent traits when choosing among younger males. The research also suggests that shorter spurs of 1-year-old pheasants are less revealing of male quality, as indicated by fluctuating asymmetry.
