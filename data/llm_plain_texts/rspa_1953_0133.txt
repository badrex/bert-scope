tldr: The authors applied Hulthen's variational method to study the elastic scattering of slow electrons by helium atoms, taking into account exchange effects. They found satisfactory agreement with previous results obtained through numerical integration of the integro-differential equation. The study also showed good agreement with experimental data, indicating that the variational method can provide accurate results over a wide range of electron energies.
