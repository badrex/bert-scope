revised_title: Biosynthesis of Porphyrins, Chlorophyll, and Vitamin B: A Discussion on Decarboxylation Pathways
semantic_tags:
  - Porphyrin biosynthesis
  - Chlorophyll
  - Vitamin B
  - Decarboxylation
  - Enzyme pathways
tldr: This article discusses the biosynthesis of porphyrins, chlorophyll, and vitamin B, focusing on the decarboxylation pathways and the enzymes involved. The authors study the intermediates between uroporphyrinogen III and coproporphyrinogen III, as well as the conversion of propionic acid side chains to vinyl groups in protoporphyrin IX. They also investigate the excretion of porphyrins in rats poisoned with hexachlorobenzene and the possible alternate pathways in abnormal metabolism.
