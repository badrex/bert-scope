revised_title: 'Active and Passive Ion Exchanges in Living Cells and Membranes'
semantic_tags:
  - Ion transport
  - Cell permeability
  - Membrane biology
  - Cellular physiology
  - Membrane transport
tldr: The author discusses the active and passive exchanges of inorganic ions through the surfaces of living cells and living membranes. They highlight the differences in ion concentrations between cells and surrounding fluids, and explain that these differences are maintained by the cell's special activity. The author also examines ion exchanges in various types of membranes, including capillary endothelium, glomerular epithelium, and blood vessels in the central nervous system.
