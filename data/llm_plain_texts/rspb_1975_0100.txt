tldr: The article discusses the observation of microtubules in the presynaptic membrane of synapses and their association with synaptic vesicles. The author suggests that microtubules play a role in the transport of synaptic vesicles to the presynaptic membrane, where they can discharge their contents. This finding contributes to the understanding of synaptic transmission and the role of microtubules in cellular biology.
