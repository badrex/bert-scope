tldr: The study investigates the effects of photoperiod and tidal cycles on larval release in the bryozoan Celleporella hyalina. It is found that larval release occurs almost entirely during daylight, with light being the primary inducing factor. Tidal oscillation has a secondary effect on larval release by controlling ambient light intensity. The daily pattern of larval release changes between unimodality and bimodality according to the amplitude and timing of low tide in relation to photoperiod.
