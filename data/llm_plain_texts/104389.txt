tldr: Archibald Cleland, a surgeon, developed a new catheter design to improve the high operation for treating bladder stones. The catheter has two legs with blunt points, a long tube, a sliding bolt, and a handle. It helps in determining the puncture location, supports the bladder, resists pressure from abdominal muscles and intestines, and keeps the orifice open during the operation. This instrument can also be used to discover if the bladder is indurated or scirrhous.
