tldr: This article explores the element of strength in beams subjected to transverse strain, known as the resistance of flexure. The author, William Henry Barlow, conducts experiments on various beam forms and analyzes the resistance of flexure as a separate element of strength. He also compares the resistance of flexure with the tensile strength of the metal and discusses the effects of different beam sections on the resistance of flexure.
