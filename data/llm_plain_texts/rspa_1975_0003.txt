tldr: The author investigates the alinement of frames of reference at null infinity for asymptotically flat Einstein-Maxwell manifolds. They show that the asymptotic twistor equation leads to the alinement of frames of reference. In the absence of gravitational radiation, this alinement reduces to a parallel one. The analysis is performed in both the original space-time and the conformally rescaled manifold.
