tldr: This article reviews the geological setting, biotic diversity, and taphonomy of Cambrian soft-bodied Lagerstatten, focusing on the Lower Cambrian Emu Bay Shale and Kinzers Formation, and the Middle Cambrian Stephen Formation. It discusses the significance of these exceptional fossil deposits in understanding early metazoan diversification, the appearance and success of various body plans, and the ecology of soft-bodied and lightly skeletized taxa in comparison to well-mineralized groups.
