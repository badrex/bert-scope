tldr: The authors investigated the diffusion and relaxation of negative ion vacancies in potassium chloride. They found that the rate of relaxation is independent of the size and shape of the specimen, suggesting that the annihilation surfaces are part of a submicroscopic structure. The temperature and time dependence of the relaxation allowed them to evaluate the diffusion coefficient for negative ion vacancies, their energy of migration, and the order of the dimensions of the mosaic blocks.
