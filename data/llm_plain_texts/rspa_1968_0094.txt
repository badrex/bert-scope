tldr: The authors investigate the time-lag and blind pore character in graphitized carbon membranes. They develop a general time-lag equation and explore its application to various microporous membranes, including Graphon, Black Pearls, Carbolac, and cracking catalyst membranes. The study reveals that blind-pore character can confer time-dependence upon the diffusion coefficients in the transient state of flow, providing valuable information about micropore systems.
