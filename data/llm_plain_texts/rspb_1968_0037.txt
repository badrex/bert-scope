tldr: The author studied the internal fine structure of Rhodopseudomonas spheroides by treating the cells with lysozyme and versene, followed by mild shearing forces. They discovered that the pigmented fragments released from the cells have properties similar to chromatophores, which are pigment-bearing particles found in photosynthetic microorganisms. The remarkable uniformity in the size of these particles is due to the breakage of the cell membrane at pre-existing "points of weakness." The study provides insights into the relationship between chromatophores and the cytoplasmic membrane in Rhodopseudomonas spheroides.
