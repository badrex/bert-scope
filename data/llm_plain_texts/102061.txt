tldr: The author examines the scales on the skin and inside the mouth, discovering that they are similar to fish scales and are made up of transparent globules. They also study the slimy substance lining the digestive system, finding numerous blood vessels and other vessels that play a crucial role in the body's functions. The author rejects the idea that lacteals and lymphatic vessels have openings to receive chyle from the digestive system, and instead proposes that nutrients pass through the thin walls of the vessels.
