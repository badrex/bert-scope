tldr: This study investigates the effects of carbohydrate and sea water on the metabolism of men without food or sufficient water. The results show that carbohydrate helps in sparing body protein, preventing ketosis, and reducing the basal metabolic rate, while sea water intake leads to increased osmotic pressure and potential harm to body tonicity and fluid distribution.
