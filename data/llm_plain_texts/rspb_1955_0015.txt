tldr: The authors studied the reactions of earthworm and lugworm hemoglobins with oxygen and carbon monoxide, finding that the rates of reaction are similar to those of mammalian hemoglobin. They discovered species differences in the course of the reactions, which may be attributed to variations in the arrangement of hem groups within the molecule. The research provides insights into the kinetics of hemoglobin reactions in invertebrates.
