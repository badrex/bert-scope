revised_title: 'The Role of Surface Tension in the Distribution of Salts in Living Matter'
semantic_tags:
  - Surface Tension
  - Salt Distribution
  - Cellular Biology
  - Osmosis
  - Physiological Processes
tldr: 'The author investigates the role of surface tension in determining the distribution of salts in living matter, specifically in the microchemical study of potassium salts in living cells. They found that surface tension plays a significant role in localizing salts and controlling the diffusion through living membranes, which affects the formation of excretions and secretions.'
