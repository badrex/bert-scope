tldr: 'J. Clerk Maxwell explains the theory of maintaining electric currents by mechanical work using electromechanical systems and commutators. He discusses the electromagnetic momentum of circuits, the effect of commutators on currents, and the conditions required to maintain currents in the system. Maxwell also explores the impact of iron cores and the role of self-induction, resistance, and electromagnetic equations in the process.'
