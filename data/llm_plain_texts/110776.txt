tldr: J. S. Bowerbank studied the organic tissues in the bony structure of corals. He used diluted nitric acid to separate the animal tissue from the calcareous matter. Under a microscope, he observed a complex vascular tissue with numerous branches and a network of fibers. This research provided insights into the internal structure of corals and their vascular system.
