tldr: The authors investigated the ionic mechanisms behind the generation of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (i.p.s.ps) in hippocampal pyramidal cells. They found that intravenous infusion of NH4 acetate or intracellular NH4 acetate did not significantly affect the i.p.s.ps, suggesting that an outward Cl- pump does not exist in hippocampal neurons. The results indicate that the i.p.s.ps are generated by an increase in conductance to both Cl- and K+ ions, challenging the original hypothesis that the i.p.s.ps are solely caused by Cl- ions.
