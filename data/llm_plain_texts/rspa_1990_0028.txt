tldr: This study investigates the velocity and size characteristics of kerosene droplets in a liquid-fueled swirl burner. The researchers used a phase-Doppler anemometry technique to measure the velocity and size of droplets in both non-reacting and reacting flows. The results provide insights into the combustion of kerosene droplets in furnace-type burners and help guide calculation methods for heterogeneous combustion. The findings can be used to scale the response of droplets to air motion in other flows through dimensionless numbers.
