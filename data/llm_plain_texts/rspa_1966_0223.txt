tldr: This article presents experimental techniques for studying the transition to detonation in an explosive gas, using novel methods such as wall imprints and stroboscopic schlieren photography. The authors discuss their findings on wave processes and interactions during the transition, providing insights into the nature of detonation and the role of pressure waves in the flow field.
