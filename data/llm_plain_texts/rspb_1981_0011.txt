tldr: The study investigates the neurobiology of the scallop's escape behaviors triggered by starfish. It explores the neural pathways and mechanisms involved in the jump and swim responses, revealing that these behaviors are centrally organized and coordinated by the cerebral ganglion. The research also provides evidence for an active relaxation mechanism in the scallop's smooth muscle, challenging previous hypotheses about the neural basis of swimming and tonic contractions.
