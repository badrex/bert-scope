tldr: This study examines the olfactory responses of Drosophila melanogaster larvae to a series of primary alcohols and identifies genetic and developmental factors influencing these responses. The research finds that larvae show varying responses to different alcohols, with some attracting and others repelling them. The authors also discover three new mutant strains with abnormal olfactory responses. These findings contribute to the understanding of olfaction in Drosophila larvae and its genetic basis.
