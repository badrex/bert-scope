tldr: The author presents a new method for analyzing optical aberrations in optical systems, extending the existing method by Gauss. This new approach allows for the calculation of aberrations in any axial system, providing a more efficient way to analyze and measure the faults of an optical image. The method is particularly useful for numerical calculations in telescopic objectives.
