tldr: This study examines the explosion region of the hydrogen-oxygen reaction in salt- and alkali-coated vessels. The authors re-evaluate the first, second, and third explosion limits, considering factors such as temperature, mixture composition, vessel size, and wall coating. They derive an expression from general chain theory that accounts for the observed features of the complete explosion region and relates previously given expressions for the individual limits.
