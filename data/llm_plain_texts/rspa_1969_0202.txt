tldr: The authors studied the interaction of glassy carbon with alkali metal vapours, specifically potassium and sodium. They found that potassium intercalates into non-graphitizing carbons, causing anisotropic expansions that lead to disruption. Sodium also causes disruption, but at higher temperatures. The authors discovered a time lag and an activation enthalpy for the onset of disruption in potassium vapour, and they analyzed the final products of the reaction with potassium.
