tldr: The article presents an exact solution of the Navier-Stokes equations for the interaction of a diffusing line vortex and an aligned shear flow. The study shows how the crossflow vorticity is expelled from the circular cylinder, and a peak vorticity is found at a radial distance. The results demonstrate the expulsion of vorticity by a circulatory flow and provide estimates for the degree of vorticity expulsion, peak vorticity, and the radius at which the peak is attained.
