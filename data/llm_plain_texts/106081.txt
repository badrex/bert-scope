tldr: The author, John Swinton, attempts to interpret two Punic inscriptions found on the reverses of Siculo-Punic coins published by Prince di Torremuzza. By analyzing the letters and comparing them to other ancient inscriptions, Swinton concludes that the inscriptions are related to the city of Segesta in Sicily. He also discusses the historical context of the coins and the Punic language's connection to Hebrew and Phoenician languages.
