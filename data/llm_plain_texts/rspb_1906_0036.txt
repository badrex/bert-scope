tldr: This article explores the "mark-time" reflex in dogs with transected spinal cords and how it is inhibited by tail stimulation. The author, C.S. Sherrington, observes that the reflex involves rhythmic flexion and extension of the limbs and is influenced by both peripheral and central factors. The tail stimulus inhibits the reflex, leading to an after-increase in activity when the inhibition is removed.
