tldr: 'James Thomson conducted experiments on the friction of discs revolving in water to improve the efficiency of turbine water-wheels and centrifugal pumps. He developed a formula to show the relation between the velocity of revolution, diameter of the disc, and mechanical work consumed in friction. He also proposed further experiments with a more refined apparatus powered by steam for greater accuracy and range.'
