tldr: The authors investigate the role of oncogenes in normal and malignant growth using retroviral insertional mutagenesis in murine mammary cancer. They focus on the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) and its potential to activate cellular oncogenes in mammary tumors. The study identifies a gene called int-1 as a candidate cellular oncogene for mammary tumors, which is activated by proviral integration and transcriptional enhancement.
