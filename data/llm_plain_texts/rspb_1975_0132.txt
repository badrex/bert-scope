semantic_tags:
  - Plant growth inhibitors
  - Abscisic acid
  - Xanthoxin
  - Hormonal control of plant growth
  - Plant stress response
tldr: The article discusses recent research on plant growth inhibitors, specifically abscisic acid (ABA) and xanthoxin. ABA, a naturally occurring growth hormone inhibitor, protects plants from various types of physiological stress. Xanthoxin, another potent growth inhibitor, has been characterized and may play a role in the hormonal control of plant growth. The article also reviews the mode of action of synthetic growth retardants.
