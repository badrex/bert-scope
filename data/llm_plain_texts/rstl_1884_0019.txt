tldr: This article presents experimental evidence to support the theory that the curve of vapour-pressure remains consistent when a substance transitions from a solid to a liquid state. The authors conducted experiments with camphor, benzene, and acetic acid, demonstrating that the vapour-pressure curve does not change significantly during this phase transition. This finding has implications for understanding the behavior of various substances in different states and conditions.
