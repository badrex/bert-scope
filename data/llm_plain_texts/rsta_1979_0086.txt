tldr: This article discusses the development of new methods in mass spectrometry for identifying organic compounds. The authors describe a reversed geometry mass spectrometer that allows for the selection and analysis of individual ionic species, enabling the construction of a comprehensive fragmentation map. This technique provides improved reproducibility and offers advantages for the detection and identification of components in mixtures. The methods can be used to deduce molecular structures of large organic molecules and distinguish between isomeric molecules.
