tldr: The authors investigated the therapeutic action of bismuthyl derivatives of organic hydroxy-acids in treating spirochetal infections, particularly syphilis. They found that certain derivatives, such as bismuthyl saccharic acid and bismuthyl gluconic acid, showed promising results in curing infections in mice and had some effect in treating human syphilis cases. However, the authors concluded that these compounds did not offer significant advantages over existing bismuth preparations.
