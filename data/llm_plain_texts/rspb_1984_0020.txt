tldr: The superfusion approach was used to compare the steroidogenic potencies of angiotensin analogues, such as angiotensin II, des-Asp1 angiotensin II, and Sar1 angiotensin II, without the effects of peptide degradation. The study found that the potency ratios of the analogues were different in closed and superfused systems, indicating that the intrinsic activities of the analogues are similar but affected by their rates of degradation. This suggests that it may not be necessary for angiotensin II or Sar1 angiotensin II to be converted to des-Asp1 angiotensin II to stimulate steroidogenesis in the system.
