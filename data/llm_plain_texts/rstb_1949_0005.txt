tldr: The author examines the molecular orientation and shape changes in lepidopteran scales during development. They found that the scales' rudiments are birefringent from the beginning, and the orientation of protein-polysaccharide molecules can be traced back to the earliest phase of development. The study provides insights into the anisometric cell growth and the underlying principles of molecular orientation in elongated cells.
