tldr: The authors studied the optical activity and tautomeric forms of di- and tetra-methyl-spiro-5:5-dihydantoins. They found that the compounds can exist in three tautomeric forms and demonstrated the effect of alkali on their rotatory dispersion. The study also showed that the diacetyl- and dibenzoyl-derivatives of the 3:7-dimethyldihydantoin undergo hydrolysis in methyl alcoholic solution at ordinary temperatures.
