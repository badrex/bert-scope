tldr: The authors propose a new theory of refraction in gases, based on constrained motion of atoms and ionization. They argue that the molecule's rotational energy, rather than free vibrations, should be considered for explaining refraction. This theory accounts for the dielectric constant, refractive index, and absorption of ultra-violet light, providing a better understanding of gas refraction phenomena.
