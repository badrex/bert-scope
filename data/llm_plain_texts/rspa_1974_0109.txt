tldr: The authors present a classical bond charge model that simulates the response of the electronic charge distribution in crystal lattices, closely resembling the quantum mechanical treatment. The model separates the electronic charge into atomic and bond distributions, aiming to explain lattice dynamics and phonon spectra in semiconductors and insulators.
