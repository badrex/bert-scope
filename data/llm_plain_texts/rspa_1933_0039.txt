tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments to investigate the decay of uranium and the formation of protactinium. They found that the decay product of uranium is a radioactive element with similar chemical properties to protactinium. The half-life of this element was measured to be approximately 5 years, confirming its identity as protactinium. This study supports the idea that uranium is the parent of protactinium.'
