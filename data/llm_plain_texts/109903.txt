tldr: The author, Everard Home, conducted experiments to better understand the changes blood undergoes during coagulation. He measured the size of blood globules, investigated the formation of tubular structures, and demonstrated that these structures could be injected with a fluid. He also observed similar structures in pus, which has implications for surgical practices.
