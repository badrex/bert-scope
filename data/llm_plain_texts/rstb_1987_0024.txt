tldr: The article introduces the fluorescence capillary-fill device (fcfd), a novel optical biosensor for immunoassays. The fcfd is based on liquid-crystal display technology and offers a simple, rapid, and cheap immunosensor with sensitivity and specificity suitable for medical diagnostics and industrial process applications. The device consists of two glass plates separated by a narrow gap, with one plate coated with immobilized antibodies and the other containing a dissolvable reagent layer of fluorescently labeled antigens. When a sample is introduced, it dissolves the reagent and competes with the sample antigens for the limited number of antibody binding sites. The device uses evanescent wave coupling to avoid the need for washing or separation steps, and a simple readout unit provides the test result in minutes.
