tldr: 'This article discusses the importance of meiosis in the evolution of sexually reproducing species. Meiosis, a process that produces genetic variation, is essential for the adaptation and survival of organisms. The author highlights the connection between meiosis and natural selection, emphasizing that meiosis works with chromosomes to implement genetic changes and drive evolution. The article also touches upon the challenges of studying meiosis and its effects on organisms and the need to bring together different disciplines to better understand its role in sexual reproduction.'
