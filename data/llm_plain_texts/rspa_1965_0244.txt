tldr: This article discusses the mechanics and impacts of atmospheric tidal oscillations, focusing on the role of Coriolis forces and compressibility in the behavior of diurnal and semidiurnal tides. The authors analyze the horizontal and vertical patterns of tidal motion and explore the differences between atmospheric and oceanic tidal oscillations.
