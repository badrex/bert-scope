tldr: This article presents a case study of a woman with a polypus at the heart and a scirrhous tumour of the uterus. The woman's body was examined after her death, revealing a large and hard swelling in the uterus, as well as three distinct protuberances. The case study discusses the woman's medical history, symptoms, and the findings from the autopsy, including the enlargement and hardening of the uterus, the presence of a polypose concretion in the right ventricle of the heart, and various adhesions in the abdomen and thorax. The author compares this case to previous observations made by Ruysch.
