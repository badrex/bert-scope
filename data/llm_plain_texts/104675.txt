tldr: The author discusses the rarity and authenticity of gold medals of Pescennius Niger, a Roman emperor. Despite the scarcity of such medals, the author, Claude Gros de Boze, shares his experience and research in searching for a genuine one. He recounts the stories of various gold medals that were discovered and deemed counterfeit. Eventually, de Boze successfully acquired a genuine gold medal, which he added to the Royal Cabinet. The medal features the goddess Concord on the reverse side, and de Boze speculates that it was struck in Tarsus, the metropolis of Cilicia.
