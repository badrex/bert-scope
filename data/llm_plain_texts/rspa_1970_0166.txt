tldr: This article discusses the development of alkali-resistant glass fibers for reinforcing cement and gypsum products, focusing on their potential advantages over existing materials in terms of impact strength, resistance to cracking, tensile and bending strength, and fire resistance. The authors also explore the challenges of effectively dispersing glass fibers in the matrix and the importance of minimizing porosity for high strength in these composite materials.
