tldr: The authors explore the application of Fourier's theorem to analyze light and its effects. They discuss the limitations of Fourier's method when dealing with infinite sets of frequencies and the importance of phase relations between the different elements of the Fourier integral. They also investigate the extent to which radiations, such as those from incandescent gases, can be considered equivalent to mixed light with a continuous spectrum composition determined by Fourier analysis.
