tldr: This paper explains how sound is refracted upwards by the atmosphere due to the decrease in temperature. The author demonstrates this through experiments and shows that this refraction can be used to explain various phenomena, such as the results of Prof. Tyndall's observations. The paper also discusses how the refraction of sound is affected by the presence of wind and the temperature of the air.
