  - Immune response
tldr: The author discusses the possibility of somatic mutations playing a role in the immune response. They propose that genetically predisposed somatic mutations could provide the immune system with the ability to respond to various foreign substances. The author suggests that antibody variability could be a result of somatic mutations and that these mutations could be influenced by the presence of suitable duplications in the genome. This theory could explain the immune system's ability to adapt and respond to different antigens.
