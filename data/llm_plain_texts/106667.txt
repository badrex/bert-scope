tldr: The article discusses various properties of the sum of divisors of numbers, focusing on the work of mathematician Edward Waring. It explores the relationship between the sum of divisors and the sum of powers of the roots in certain equations, and introduces the concept of the sum of prime divisors. The article also provides methods for finding the sum of divisors and prime divisors in terms of other sums, and discusses the application of these principles to various equations.
