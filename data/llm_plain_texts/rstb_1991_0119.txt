tldr: The study examines morphological characters in two separate cols of the grasshopper species Chorthippus parallelus, which meet and hybridize in the Pyrenees. The authors find that clines for different characters are neither coincident nor concordant in either col, and suggest that this is due to differences in population structure between the cols. The research provides insights into the origin, maintenance, and fate of hybrid zones by analyzing variations in morphological characters and their implications for evolutionary processes.
