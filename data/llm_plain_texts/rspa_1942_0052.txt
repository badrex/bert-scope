tldr: This study investigates the behavior of gases, specifically firedamp and hydrogen, as they stream freely in sloping galleries. The author develops a general equation for this phenomenon and compares calculated velocities with experimental results. The research also explores the velocity discontinuity and its relation to the depth of the gas stream in the gallery.
