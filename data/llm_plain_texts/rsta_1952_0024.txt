tldr: The author conducted experiments to investigate the Earth's magnetism and the Schuster-Wilson hypothesis. They used astatic systems and E-coils to measure the magnetic field sensitivity and found that no field of the Schuster-Wilson hypothesis was detected. The study concluded that improvements in the method could be made, but the main objective of proving the hypothesis was achieved.
