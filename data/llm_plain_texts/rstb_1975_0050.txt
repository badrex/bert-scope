tldr: This article discusses the importance of understanding the pericellular environment in vertebrate tissues, focusing on the measurement of pH and ionic composition. The authors describe the use of various glass electrodes and ion exchangers to study these parameters and their potential impact on enzyme substrates and cellular metabolism. They also highlight the changes in the local environment during inflammatory reactions and the potential implications for understanding and treating various conditions.
