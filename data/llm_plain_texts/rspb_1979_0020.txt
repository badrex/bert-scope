tldr: The article discusses the theory of serial endosymbiosis, which proposes that a primitive eukaryote took up bacteria and blue-green algae to create mitochondria and chloroplasts, respectively. The authors examine the characteristics of transitional forms and the possible ancestry of various organelles, focusing on the similarities between mitochondria and aerobic bacteria and the differences between different types of chloroplasts.
