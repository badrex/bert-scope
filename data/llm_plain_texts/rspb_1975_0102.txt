tldr: This study investigates the distribution, population density, and biomass of fish in Lake George, Uganda. Researchers used purse seines to catch fish in the shallow lake, collecting data from various sites along the shoreline and in the open lake region. They identified 32 fish species, with Haplochromis nigripinnis dominating in population density and biomass. Fish were found to be more abundant inshore than offshore, and the study discusses possible reasons for this distribution.
