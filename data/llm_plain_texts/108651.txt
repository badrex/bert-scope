tldr: The author, Arthur Cayley, presents supplementary research on the partition of numbers, focusing on a general formula for rational fractions with specific denominators. He explains the process of obtaining the number of partitions using various mathematical techniques and theorems, including Bernoulli numbers. This work contributes to the understanding and development of number theory and combinatorics.
