tldr: The authors present a theory explaining the diffraction and reflection of molecular rays at crystal surfaces. They demonstrate that the minima in experimental curves of helium and hydrogen can be explained using this theory and provide information about the potential energy of gas molecules in the solid's field. This research has implications for understanding adsorption and selective adsorption processes.
