tldr: 'The article discusses the historical event of the Royal Society's rejection of John Herapath's kinetic theory of gases in 1821. Herapath's theory was opposed by Humphry Davy, who held the position of the society's president at the time. The rejection of Herapath's theory highlights the distinction between the kinetic and vibration theories of heat and sheds light on the character of early 19th-century British science. Despite the rejection, Herapath's theory later influenced the development of the kinetic theory of gases by scientists like Joule, Kronig, Clausius, and Maxwell.'
