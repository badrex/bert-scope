tldr: This paper explores the hypotheses that the physically significant solutions of Maxwell's equations are time-symmetric and that radiation is not an intrinsic property of charge. The author concludes that the electrodynamical arrow-of-time is a consequence of certain cosmological models and is incompatible with others, while in a static universe, it is indeterminate and meaningless. The study suggests that the arrow-of-time is determined by the cosmological properties of the universe.
