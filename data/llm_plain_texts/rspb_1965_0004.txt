tldr: The authors discuss the development of habitats in the post-Glacial period and the role of post-Glacial refugia in the faunal history of the British Isles. They suggest that the persistence of boreal and alpine species in these refugia can be related to unstable soil conditions, low maximum summer temperatures, and open vegetation. The study also highlights the importance of understanding the post-Glacial history and habitat development for better comprehension of the current distribution of species.
