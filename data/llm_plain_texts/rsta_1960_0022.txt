tldr: The authors develop the electromagnetic field theory and apply it to the problem of devising systems that behave as classical particles. They find that spherically symmetrical systems can exist, satisfying the static form of the extended equations and being in equilibrium under the sole action of the Maxwellian stress of their own field. The transformation behavior of the field equations is also investigated, revealing an invariance in form under wider transformations of the field variables than those permitted by the classical equations.
