tldr: The authors propose the possibility of a general excess of charge in the universe and explore its physical consequences. They suggest that this excess charge could result in powerful electric forces that drive the expansion of the universe using Newtonian mechanics. The hypothesis also implies that galaxies and clusters of galaxies form as ionized condensation units within the general background distribution.
