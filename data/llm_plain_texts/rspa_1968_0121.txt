tldr: The authors present a uniformly valid asymptotic solution for the pressure distribution inside a finite journal bearing with small clearance using Reynolds' equation. They construct an asymptotic expansion in terms of the eccentricity and evaluate the thrust and frictional couple per unit length. The method of inner and outer expansions is used to obtain a uniformly valid solution and determine the eigenvalues.
