tldr: The author discusses a differential equation that occurs in the two-dimensional motion of a compressible fluid and its associated variational problems. They explore the properties of the equation and the conditions required for a unique solution, considering both elliptic and hyperbolic types. The author also examines the connection between hydrodynamics and the calculus of variations.
