tldr: The study investigates the number and distribution of Meynert cells in area 17 of the macaque monkey's visual cortex. Researchers found that there are between 30,000 and 40,000 Meynert cells in one hemisphere, with an average uniform area density of about 25 cells per square millimeter. The findings suggest that the functional architecture of the visual cortex is basic and uniform.
