tldr: The authors study the development of continuum damage in the creep rupture of notched bars, both experimentally and numerically. They use a time-iterative numerical procedure to model the formation and growth of creep damage as a field quantity, and find close agreement between experimental and theoretical values of rupture stress, zones of creep damage, and crack development. The study validates the numerical procedures and provides a better understanding of the mechanisms by which cracks grow due to creep.
