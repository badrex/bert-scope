tldr: This study presents a solution to the elasto-hydrodynamic problem of normal approach in lubrication, considering constant and pressure-dependent viscosity. The research focuses on the motion of two cylinders separated by a lubricating film and provides numerical solutions for various cases. The findings show that elastic loads are greater than rigid loads for a given maximum pressure and central film thickness, and the difference between them decreases as the film thickness increases.
