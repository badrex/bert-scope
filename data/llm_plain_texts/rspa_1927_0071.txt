tldr: The authors apply the new quantum mechanics to study the dispersion of radiation and the scattering of light by atoms. They develop a formalism that reconciles the wave and light-quantum points of view and use perturbation methods to calculate the scattered radiation. The theory predicts that when the incident radiation frequency coincides with an absorption or emission line, the scattered radiation consists of two parts, one increasing proportionally to the time since the interaction began, and the other increasing proportionally to the square of this time.
