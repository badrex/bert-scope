tldr: The author, William Hyde Wollaston, explains the methods of cutting rock crystal for micrometers to enhance the double refraction effect. He describes three types of crystal wedges and their combinations to achieve different levels of separation between images. This technique can be used to improve the accuracy of micrometers and other optical instruments.
