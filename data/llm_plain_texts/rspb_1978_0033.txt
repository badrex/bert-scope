tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the transfer of a determinant for chloramphenicol resistance between mammalian cell lines. They found that enucleated fragments, or cytoplasts, from a chloramphenicol-resistant human cell line could transfer the resistance to other human cell lines. This suggests that chloramphenicol resistance is determined by a cytoplasmic factor. The authors also discovered that the fusion products of cytoplasts and whole cells contained mixed populations of mitochondria from both parental cells.
