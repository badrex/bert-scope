tldr: This article investigates the effects of steam and temperature on the explosion limits of carbonic oxide-air mixtures at high pressures. The authors found that increasing pressure narrows the explosion range of "dry" mixtures, while the explosion range of "moist" mixtures remains unchanged. They also discovered that increasing temperature widens the explosion range.
