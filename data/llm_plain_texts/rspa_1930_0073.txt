tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the oxidation of coal residues from benzene-pressure extraction, revealing that a significant part of the coal substance has a benzenoid structure. They found that the oxidation with alkaline permanganate produced mainly benzene carboxylic acids, oxalic acid, and acetic acid. This suggests that coal may have formed through condensations of phenolic- and amino- with aldehydic-bodies, similar to the synthesis of bakelite. The authors propose further research to test and discuss these findings.
