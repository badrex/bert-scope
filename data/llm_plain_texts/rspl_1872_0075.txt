tldr: This paper explores the mathematical expression of observations of complex periodical phenomena and their influence on Earth. The authors analyze diurnal variations of wind and barometer data from Bombay and find that land and sea breezes play a significant role. Their findings support Halley's theory of trade-winds as applied to land and sea breezes.
