tldr: This article describes the author's observations of the transit of Mercury over the Sun and investigates the causes that often prevent the proper functioning of mirrors. The author found that the temperature and moisture content of the atmosphere significantly affect telescope performance. He also discovered that frost, mild weather, wind, and changes in temperature can negatively impact the clarity of telescopic vision. Lastly, the author suggests that heat and cold can cause distortion in mirrors, which affects telescope performance.
