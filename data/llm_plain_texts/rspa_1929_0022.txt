tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the efficiency of zinc-sulphide in transforming the energy of alpha particles into radiant energy. They used an alpha-ray tube filled with radon and various zinc-sulphide coverings to measure the spectral distribution of the radiant energy in absolute units. The results showed that the luminous efficiency of zinc-sulphide was around 10-15%, with the efficiency of transforming alpha particle energy into radiant energy being around 1.5%. The study also compared the brightness of the alpha-ray tube to a plane screen of the same zinc-sulphide with known alpha particle energy and numbers.
