revised_title: 'Influence of Oxygen Inhalation on Blood Gases in Cats'

  - Blood gases

  - Oxygen inhalation
  - Carbon dioxide
  - Hemoglobin
tldr: The authors conducted experiments on cats to study the effects of breathing oxygen-rich gas mixtures on their blood gases. They found that the average blood gases in cats breathing oxygen were practically identical to those breathing air. The inhalation of oxygen did not necessarily increase the amount of oxygen in the blood or affect the carbon dioxide levels. The study suggests that the state of hyperpnea affects the carbon dioxide output rather than the oxygen intake.
