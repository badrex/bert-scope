tldr: The author conducted experiments in North Wales to measure the different quantities of rain that fell at various heights. The results showed that the increase in rainfall was due to the closer proximity to the ground rather than the height of the location. This research could help solve a long-standing debate between mountain and plain inhabitants about rainfall patterns.
