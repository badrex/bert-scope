tldr: This article discusses the use of Mossbauer spectroscopy to analyze lunar samples and understand the Moon's geological features. The study focuses on the distribution of iron in the lunar regolith, the thermal history of lunar rocks, and the presence of superparamagnetic iron particles in the surface layers of soil particles. The research provides valuable information on the Moon's formation and evolution.
