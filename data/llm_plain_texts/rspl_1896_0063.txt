tldr: The author discovers a new type of fossil cone called Cheirostrobus from the calciferous sandstone. The cone has a unique structure with compound branched sporo-phylls, each bearing a number of sporangia. The study of this new cone helps in understanding the taxonomy and morphology of fossil plants, particularly those from the Carboniferous formation.
