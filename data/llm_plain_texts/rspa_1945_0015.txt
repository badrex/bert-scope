tldr: This article introduces the use of complex potentials in two-dimensional elasticity, providing a more elegant and algebraically simpler approach to solving problems in plane strain, generalized plane stress, and plane stress. The method involves using complex variables and stress combinations, which are related to orthogonal curvilinear coordinates, to transform and simplify the equations for stresses and displacements. The complex potentials are shown to be useful in finding appropriate solutions for various problems in elasticity.
