tldr: The authors discuss the observation and analysis of c-mesons emerging from stars. They describe a star event with 33 ionizing tracks, 16 black, 13 grey, and 4 at minimum. The primary particle is assumed to be a neutron, and the total energy represented by the tracks is about 6 GeV. The AC-meson is short and decays at rest after 297 p of path in the emulsion, while the secondary is also short and comes out after 600/t of path with an ionization of T05 + 0-5 times minimum.
