tldr: Researchers discovered that the chemical environment of plant cells can alter their shape by modifying the structure and plasticity of their cell walls. By studying the effects of indole acetic acid (IAA) and benzimidazole (BIA) on pea epicotyl sections, they found that changes in cell wall structure, specifically the arrangement of cellulose microfibrils, play a significant role in determining cell shape. This research has implications for understanding cell and tissue differentiation and the mechanisms behind plant growth.
