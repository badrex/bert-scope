tldr: The author investigates double (antidrome) conduction in the central nervous system, specifically in the spinal cord's dorsal columns. They discovered that conduction can occur in a downward, cellulipetal direction along ascending axons, which is in opposition to their normal cellulifugal direction. This phenomenon demonstrates the potential for antidrome conduction within the central nervous system and could be a valuable tool for neurological research.
