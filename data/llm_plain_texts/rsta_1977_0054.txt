revised_title: Gravitational Separation of Quenching Crystals in Lunar Basalts

  - Regolith formation
tldr: The authors propose that the low viscosity of lunar lavas allowed quenching crystals to sink and accumulate, leading to chemical differentiation in lunar basalts. This process, combined with regolith formation, may explain the observed variations in hand specimen compositions from the Apollo 12 and 15 missions.
