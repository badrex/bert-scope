tldr: The authors investigated the capacity of the rat brain to support the physiological function of allografts, using parathyroidectomized Fischer strain rats with isografts or immunogenic DA allografts of parathyroid glands implanted in their cerebral cortices. They found that both isografts and allografts survived indefinitely in the brain, maintaining normal serum calcium levels. The results suggest that the rat cerebral cortex is an immunologically privileged site, and the privilege is not dependent on graft immunogenicity or alterations in host responsiveness.
