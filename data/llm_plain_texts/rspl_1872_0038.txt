tldr: The author examines the anatomy and histology of land-planarians from Ceylon, focusing on two new species. They describe the animals' habits, including their use of body slime for suspension, and provide detailed observations on their anatomy, including muscular arrangement, digestive tracts, and reproductive systems. The study reveals similarities between land-planarians and other worms, such as leeches, and contributes to the understanding of Turbellaria biology.
