tldr: The author corrects a mistake in their previous paper about the existence and uniqueness of certain measures. They clarify that the results are valid for real-analytic functions and ensembles, as defined by Whitney and Bruhat. The corrected paper addresses concerns raised by M. Bruhat and provides a clearer understanding of the intersection of irreducible sets.
