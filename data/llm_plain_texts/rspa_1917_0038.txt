revised_title: Residual Affinity and Molecular Compounds
semantic_tags:
  - Chemical Affinity
  - Molecular Compounds
  - Valency
  - Chemical Bonding
  - Residual Affinity
tldr: The author discusses the concept of residual affinity in chemical bonding and its role in the formation of molecular compounds. They explain how higher valencies and multiple linkages can exist in certain elements, leading to the formation of complex molecules. The author also explores the relationship between residual affinity and the properties of metallo-compounds and their complexes.
