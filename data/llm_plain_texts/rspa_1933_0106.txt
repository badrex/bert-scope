tldr: This article extends previous work on mathematical modeling of disease spread by introducing non-specific death rates. The authors analyze the effects of these rates on the steady state of the disease and the rate of disease incidence. They provide conditions for a steady state and discuss the impact of changes in immigration, birth, and death rates on disease spread.
