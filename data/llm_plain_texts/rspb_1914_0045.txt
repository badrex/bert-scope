tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the changes in the glomeruli and tubules of the kidney during diuresis. They found that both Bowman's capsule and the glomerulus are distensible structures, and during activity, the glomerulus does not remain in contact with the capsule wall. This observation opposes the filtration theory of glomerular activity. The study also showed significant changes in the size and lumen of the renal tubules during activity, suggesting that the basement membrane of the proximal and distal convoluted tubules have different degrees of extensibility.
