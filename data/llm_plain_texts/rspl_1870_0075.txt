tldr: The author discusses the mechanism of respiration, focusing on the role of the diaphragm and its tension. They emphasize the importance of the diaphragm's passive tension in retaining supplemental air in the lungs, restoring equilibrium, and maintaining the pericardial space. The author also examines the actions of other muscles involved in respiration, such as the intercostal muscles and serratus magnus, and debunks common misconceptions about abdominal and thoracic breathing.
