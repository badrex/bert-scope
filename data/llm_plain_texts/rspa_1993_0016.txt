tldr: The author investigates the flow of a fluid in a shallow cavity driven by lateral heating. They explore the asymptotic structures of the flow and discover a new regime when the Rayleigh number is of the same order as the aspect ratio. This new regime is characterized by a change in the amplitude of the core motion and a reduction in the horizontal temperature gradient. The author compares their findings with experimental and numerical results, showing good agreement.
