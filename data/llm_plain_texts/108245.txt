tldr: This article explores the figure a fluid would assume when acted upon by the attraction of every other particle and a centrifugal force due to rotation. The author calculates the attraction and the figure of the Earth, considering a fluid with varying density and a centrifugal force caused by rotation. The study provides equations for the surface of equilibrium and extends Clairaut's theorem to this scenario.
