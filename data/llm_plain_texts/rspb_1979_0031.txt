tldr: This study examines the surface of human chorionic villi and reveals differentiated regions associated with placental attachment, phagocytosis of maternal erythrocytes, and syncytiotrophoblast repair. The research provides insights into the functional differentiation of specific areas of placental cell surface, which is essential for placental attachment, maintenance, and fetal nutrition.
