tldr: The spiracular gill of the fly Taphrophila vitripennis plays a crucial role in the insect's respiratory system, allowing it to extract oxygen from water and adapt to both aquatic and terrestrial environments. The isolated tissue in the spiracular gill can repair damage during the adult's pharate stage and even after the pupal cuticle is shed. This unique phenomenon has no close parallel among other animals.
