tldr: The authors conducted an X-ray study to analyze the heat motions of atoms in a rock-salt crystal. They compared their findings with Debye's equation and found that the temperature factor was consistent with the theoretical formulae. The study provided insights into the atomic structure and heat motions in the crystal lattice, which is essential for understanding the behavior of materials at different temperatures.
