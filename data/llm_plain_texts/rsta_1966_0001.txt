tldr: The authors measured the specific enthalpy of steam at pressures between 60 to 1000 bar and temperatures from 400 to 700°C using a continuous flow method. They found an empirical correlating equation to determine the enthalpy of steam, with an estimated accuracy of 0.1%. This research contributes to the development of accurate steam tables for power engineers and other users of high-pressure steam.
