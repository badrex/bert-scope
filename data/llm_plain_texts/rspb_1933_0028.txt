tldr: This study investigates the permeability of human skin to electrolytes in solution. The authors immersed an arm in solutions of lithium chloride and potassium iodide and analyzed the urine and blood before and after immersion. They found that the intact human skin is completely impermeable to electrolytes in simple solutions, which is important for understanding the body's protective mechanisms and the effectiveness of topical treatments.
