tldr: The authors study the traces of powers of the quantum propagator associated with Anosov-perturbed cat maps, focusing on the case when the perturbation parameter is small. They derive a complete semiclassical expansion for the traces, which is related to the length-n periodic orbits of the classical mapping. The expansion is shown to diverge, but summing it down to its least term provides an exponentially accurate approximation to the quantum trace. The authors also explain the divergence of the semiclassical expansion in terms of complex (tunnelling) periodic orbits and demonstrate the existence of unusual relations between different orbit actions.
