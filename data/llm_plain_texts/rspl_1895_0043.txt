tldr: The author conducted experiments on the electrolysis of gases using a spectroscope to detect the movement of ions in a discharge tube. They discovered that ions move in opposite directions along the tube, depending on the gas and pressure conditions. The author also found that certain ions carry a charge of negative or positive electricity, suggesting that they play a role in the chemical reactions occurring during electrolysis.
