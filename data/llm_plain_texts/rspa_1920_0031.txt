tldr: The authors studied the catalytic actions of solid surfaces, specifically the hydrogenation of acetaldehyde and the dehydrogenation of ethyl alcohol in the presence of finely-divided metals. They discovered that water has a protective influence on aldehyde, preventing its decomposition. The authors suggest that the primary action of the catalyst is to form an unstable complex with the carbon compound, which then resolves into other compounds.
