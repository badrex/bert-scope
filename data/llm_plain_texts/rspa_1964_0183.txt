tldr: The article explores the specialization theory of polynomial modules, focusing on the connections between saturated and -complete modules. It also studies the behavior of embedded components using a relative reduction theory. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the properties of polynomial modules and their applications in algebraic geometry and commutative algebra.
