tldr: This study investigates cardenolide storage in Danaus chrysippus butterflies and compares it with D. plexippus. It finds that adult D. chrysippus is a poor and inconsistent storer of cardiac glycosides compared to D. plexippus. The research also shows that populations in East Africa are more efficient storers than those in West Africa, which may contribute to the lack of mimics in West Africa. Furthermore, there appears to be a genetic element in the storage capacity of these butterflies, not just a'mirror' effect based on the cardenolide content of their food plants.
