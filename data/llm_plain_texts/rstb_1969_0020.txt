tldr: This study examines the polychaete fauna in the Solomon Islands, focusing on their ecology and commensal relationships with other marine animals. The research explores various habitats, including beachrock, Phyllochaetopterus and Amphiroa colonies, and silty-sand deposits of Thalassia flats. The authors discuss the polychaete species' interactions with other animals, such as boring sipunculids and calcareous algae, and highlight the importance of these relationships in the marine ecosystem.
