tldr: The author discusses the unusual sightings of icebergs in lower latitudes in the southern hemisphere, specifically near the Cape of Good Hope and the coast of South Africa. These sightings were observed in the late 18th and early 19th centuries and led the author to speculate on the possible causes, such as earthquakes or volcanic forces, which could have disrupted the icebergs' formation.
