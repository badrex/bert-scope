tldr: The author investigates the fluid dynamics of a rotating disk thrust into an interface supporting an insoluble, viscous surface film. They develop a theory of absolute surface shear viscosity, taking into account the hydrodynamic coupling between the internal viscosity of the substrate and the surface viscosity of the adsorbed surface film. The study provides a better understanding of the flow patterns near the rim of the disk and helps improve the interpretation of surface viscometry experiments.
