tldr: The authors conducted experiments on molecular oxygen gas and analyzed its paramagnetic resonance absorption using a more accurate theoretical approach. They discovered that the electron spin factor in the molecule deviates from the free spin value, which led to a better understanding of the molecular interactions and improved the accuracy of the experimental results.
