revised_title: 'Geographical Analysis of a Latitudinal Cline in a Drosophila Clock Gene'

tldr: The authors studied the geographical distribution of a length polymorphism in the period gene of Drosophila melanogaster across Europe and North Africa. They found a robust clinal pattern along a north-south axis, suggesting that the length polymorphism could be maintained by thermal selection.
