tldr: The authors present a new method for solving the boundary-value problem of diffraction of elastic waves by penny-shaped cracks. They use an elastic double layer potential and derive a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind for the discontinuity in the displacement across the crack. The solution of this equation represents the displacement field as an elastic double layer with a density that satisfies certain conditions. This method extends previous work in two-dimensional acoustics and provides a rigorous solution for three-dimensional elastodynamics.
