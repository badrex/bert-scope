tldr: The authors studied the nature of mercury-carbon bonds in mercury alkyl radicals and found that the bonds are predominantly polarization bonds. They also discussed the energetics and normal internuclear separation of these bonds, concluding that the bond in mercury alkyl radicals is stabilized by resonance with an excited covalent structure.
