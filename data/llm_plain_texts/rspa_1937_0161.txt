tldr: The authors extend Bethe's theory of order-disorder transitions in metallic alloys, considering interactions between atoms and their next nearest neighbors. They find that the critical temperature decreases, and the temperature dependence of the system increases. The study provides insights into the behavior of long-distance and local orders in metallic alloys, as well as their energy and specific heat.
