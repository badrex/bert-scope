tldr: The authors studied the scattering of light by liquid boundaries and its relation to surface tension. They observed that the intensity and state of polarization of the scattered light depend on the angle of incidence of the primary rays and the direction of observation. The study demonstrated the molecular origin of the phenomenon and its connection to surface tension, providing a comprehensive understanding of the behavior of light in various liquids.
