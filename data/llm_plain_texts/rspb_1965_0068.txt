tldr: The study investigates the isotonic shortening velocities of frog rectus abdominis muscles in potassium contracture. It found that the velocity of shortening is dependent not only on muscle length and tension but also on the muscle's history. The results indicate that the velocity of isotonic shortening is affected by the length the muscle has shortened through or the time that has elapsed since release.
