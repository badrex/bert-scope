tldr: The Royal Society's Joint Air-Sea Interaction Project (JASIN) investigated the structure and variability of the upper ocean's velocity field. The study found that energetic, eddy-like circulation dominated the velocity field in the JASIN area at depths shallower than 800 meters. The research also showed that local wind stress influenced some of the increased variability found near the surface, but not all of it. The findings provide a better understanding of how wind affects ocean currents and mixing.
