tldr: The authors study the formation of graphite/bromine compounds and the hysteresis of bromine insertion between carbon hexagon layers. They discover that well-oriented graphite forms metastable structures with full expansion for only about one-third of the limiting uptake. Given sufficient time, all solids attain a more stable group of structures with molar volumes in linear relation to the bromine uptake. The authors also find critical thresholds for crystal compound formation and discuss factors leading to irreversibility in inserting or removing bromine between layers.
