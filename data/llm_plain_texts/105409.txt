tldr: This article narrates a case study of a lady who accidentally swallowed a poisonous substance, euphorbium tincture. The author, Dr. Willis, and Sir Francis Dashwood detail the treatment process, which involved administering large quantities of warm water and oil to dilute and expel the poison. The patient eventually recovered, and the authors discuss the potential role of water, oil, and camphor as effective antidotes for poisoning cases.
