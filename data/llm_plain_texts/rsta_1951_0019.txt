tldr: This article investigates the mechanical behavior of single crystals of face-centred cubic metals, such as gold, silver, and nickel. The authors study the stress-glide relationship and the effect of temperature on the hardening process. They also explore the role of surface conditions and the interaction of glide planes in these metals. The results show a linear relationship between the cube root of the breaking stress and temperature for all metals in single-crystal form.
