tldr: The authors investigate the morphogenesis of secondary vortices in the viscoelastic Taylor-Couette flow, using the Oldroyd-B constitutive equation to model the fluid. They analyze three distinct solution families, where the onset of instability is due to inertia, both inertia and elasticity, and exclusively elasticity. The study shows that the secondary flow can be steady or time-periodic, and the results are consistent with time-dependent numerical simulations.
