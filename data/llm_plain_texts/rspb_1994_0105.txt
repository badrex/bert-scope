tldr: The authors investigate the effects of an electric field on rotating waves in cardiac muscle, proposing a theoretical model that shows how an electric field can modify the dynamics of excitation waves. They suggest that applying a weak voltage across the heart muscle could potentially control pathological rotating waves, which are responsible for dangerous cardiac arrhythmias.
