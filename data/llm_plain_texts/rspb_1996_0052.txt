tldr: The article discusses the conflict between hosts and their symbionts over the mixing of symbiotic lineages. The author, Steven A. Frank, explains how hosts favor reduced mixing of symbionts to increase within-host relatedness and lower virulence. This conflict is analyzed in various biological examples, including figs and their pollinator wasps, and the importance of understanding these interactions is highlighted for a broader range of phenomena in the study of symbiosis.
