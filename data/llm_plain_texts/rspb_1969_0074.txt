tldr: Researchers E. T. Burtt and W. T. Catton studied the resolving power of the locust eye by using radial striped patterns rotated around the eye. They found that the highest resolution was 10 degrees of stripe angle and a mean threshold of 20 degrees. This result is important for understanding how locusts perceive their environment and could have implications for future research on insect vision and optics.
