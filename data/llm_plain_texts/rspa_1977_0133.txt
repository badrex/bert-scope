tldr: This study investigates the quenching mechanisms of singlet molecular oxygen, focusing on the kinetics of quenching by various agents. Rate coefficients for the quenching of singlet oxygen by CO and other species are determined, and efficient wall deactivation of singlet oxygen by adsorbed hydrogen halides is observed. The results provide insights into the energy transfer processes and the importance of near-resonance between electronic energy and vibrational energy in the quenching process.
