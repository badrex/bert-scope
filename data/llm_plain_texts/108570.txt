tldr: The author, G.G. Stokes, describes a new method of observing the change of refrangibility of light using absorbing media. This method allows for the detection of fluorescence in various substances, providing a means to study their sensitivity. The author also discusses the ideal properties of absorbing media and the importance of controlling the experimental conditions to obtain accurate results.
