tldr: The author conducted experiments to measure the conductive powers of various substances and their impact on terrestrial temperature. They developed a formula to compare the conducting powers of different materials and tested the effects of pressure and moisture on their conductive abilities. The author also applied the research to the problem of Earth's temperature, investigating the temperature increase in vertical lines through different strata and comparing it to observed temperature data from various wells and shafts.
