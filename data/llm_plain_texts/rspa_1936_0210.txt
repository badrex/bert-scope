tldr: The authors present a self-consistent field calculation with exchange for the copper atom. They discuss the challenges of solving Fock's equations for the copper atom due to its sensitive outermost group and the large number of functions involved. The authors successfully calculate the radial wave functions and present the results, highlighting the contraction of the outermost group and the relatively small alteration of the other groups in the outer shell.
