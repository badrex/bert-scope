tldr: The authors discuss the radiative corrections to the angular correlation in internal pair creation, focusing on the zero-zero transition in. They present numerical results and analyze the effects of the Coulomb field, nuclear structure, and non-Coulomb forces on the total pair emission. The study provides a more detailed test of the radiative correction theory in situations involving larger momentum transfer.
