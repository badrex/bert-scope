tldr: The authors explore the properties of zeros of entire functions of exponential type to solve the phase problem in scattering phenomena. They demonstrate how to create a sufficiently large zero-free area to obtain a good approximation of the actual phase, leading to a new interpretation of Gibbs' and speckle phenomena. The study focuses on one-dimensional cases and assumes that the object wave is of finite extent.
