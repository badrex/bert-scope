tldr: This article investigates the hydrodynamic stability of flows without solid boundaries, such as jets, wakes, and free boundary layers. The authors extend McKoen's method to obtain a complex equation defining a neutral curve with two branches and a least critical Reynolds number. They apply this method to the stability of a laminar jet and find a critical Reynolds number for instability.
