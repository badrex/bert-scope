tldr: The authors studied the cytology of the fern flora on Tristan da Cunha, an isolated South Atlantic island. They examined 20 out of 26 fern species and found high chromosome numbers and complex polyploid relationships. The results provide insights into the fern flora's endemism and its connections with other temperate and tropical floras in the Atlantic basin.
