tldr: The authors investigated the plant growth-regulating activity of dextro and laevo enantiomers of (2-naphthoxy)propionic acid. They found that the (âˆ’)-isomer had high activity, while the (+)-isomer had negligible activity in various tests, including the Went pea test, Avena cylinder test, tomato-leaf epinasty, and rooting of cuttings. This demonstrates that one optically active form of a growth substance can induce different growth responses in plants, while its enantiomorph can be inactive.
