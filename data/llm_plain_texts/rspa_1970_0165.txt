tldr: This article discusses the use of fibrous reinforced polymers (FRP) in building design, focusing on their unique properties and challenges in structural applications. FRP materials offer benefits such as light weight, corrosion resistance, and optical transparency, making them suitable for various building elements. However, their use in buildings presents challenges, including the need to prevent crack formation in the matrix and address fatigue effects from mechanical or thermal stress. The article explores potential solutions to these challenges, such as controlling fiber placement, using flexible resins, and incorporating rubber particles to improve the material's toughness.
