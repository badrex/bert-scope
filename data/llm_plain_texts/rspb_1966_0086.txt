tldr: The authors conducted an electron microscopy study on the retinae of monkeys and humans to identify cell types, their processes, and synaptic contacts. They described the morphological characteristics of bipolar, ganglion, and amacrine cells in the inner plexiform layer and identified seven synaptic relationships. The study provides a model of the retina based on its anatomy and correlates it with ganglion cell physiology.
