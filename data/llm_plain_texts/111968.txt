tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the role of light and temperature in the development of tadpoles and frogs. They found that the development of tadpoles and frogs is mainly dependent on temperature, and light can either have no effect or slow down the process. The author also discovered that tadpoles need to rise to the surface of the water to breathe air during their metamorphosis, and that the transformation process requires about 14 days for tadpoles at their full growth.
