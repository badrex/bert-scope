tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments using a hot-wire anemometer to record turbulent motion in air and analyze velocity variations in a wind tunnel. They developed a new method to analyze turbulent flow and discovered interesting facts about the changes of motion in a system of eddies. This method can be used to calculate the relative number of times a given displacement has been reached or exceeded and provides data for plotting frequency curves that indicate the distribution of velocity variations.'
