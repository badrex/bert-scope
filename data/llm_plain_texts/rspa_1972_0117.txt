tldr: The authors studied the rates of ethylene polymerization on a supported chromium oxide catalyst. They found that the reaction rates were first order in ethylene pressure and that the catalyst's activity increased with pretreatment time, reaching a maximum before declining due to over-reduction. The results suggest that active sites on the catalyst surface are produced during contact with ethylene at 300Â°C, and that these sites can be reactivated by adsorbing ethylene at low temperatures.
