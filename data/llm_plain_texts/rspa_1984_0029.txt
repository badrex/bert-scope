tldr: This article presents a mathematical model for the etching of a semi-infinite active surface, focusing on the transport of the active species by diffusion. The author demonstrates how to solve the problem using a singular perturbation technique, distinguishing a near field and a far field, and provides the leading terms of a composite expansion to determine the shape of the moving boundary at all times.
