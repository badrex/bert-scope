revised_title: 'The Mechanism of DNA Denaturation by Y-Rays'
semantic_tags:
  - DNA denaturation
  - Y-rays
  - Free radicals
  - Indirect action
  - Radiolysis
tldr: The authors investigate the mechanism of DNA denaturation by y-rays and conclude that it is an indirect effect caused by free radicals produced by radiolysis of water. They find that the denaturing effect of y-rays is proportional to the concentration of DNA and is inhibited by substances that react with free radicals. The study also shows that y-rays are less effective in the presence of chloride than fluoride ions, suggesting that DNA is attacked by more reactive hydroxyl radicals in fluoride solutions.
