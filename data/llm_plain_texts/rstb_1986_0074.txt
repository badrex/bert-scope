tldr: This study examines the biological characteristics of bird species invading Britain and evaluates the factors that contribute to successful colonization. It explores the relationship between migratory behavior and invasive probability, finding that sedentary families are more likely to undergo range expansions. The findings align with predictions of the MacArthur-Wilson theory of island colonization, emphasizing the importance of factors such as population size, rate of population increase, and habitat competition in the success of bird invasions.
