tldr: The author's study examines the relationship between sperm size and sperm competition success in the bulb mite. They found that males producing larger sperm were more successful in sperm competition. Additionally, their ejaculates had smaller variation in sperm size, indicating better resource allocation and stability per gamete. This research contributes to understanding the selective pressures in species with promiscuous mating and the role of sperm characteristics in reproductive success.
