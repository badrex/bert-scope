tldr: This study investigates the conditions for flame stability on unconfined flat sprays, focusing on the processes of heat, mass, and momentum transfer, and chemical reactions. A theoretical model is developed and experimentally confirmed, providing insights into the interrelation between these factors and the stabilization of flames in spray combustion.
