tldr: The authors studied the absorption spectrum of formic acid in the vacuum ultra-violet region. They discovered that the first strong absorption starts around 1400 Angstroms and consists of electronic transitions with vibrational patterns. The ionization potential of formic acid was determined, and the results were compared with those of formaldehyde. The study found that the strong near ultra-violet absorption bands of aldehydes and ketones are suppressed in formic acid, suggesting that the carboxyl group may not be electronically the same in acids as in ketones.
