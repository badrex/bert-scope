tldr: In this experiment, Mr. Hauksbee demonstrated the effects of gunpowder on a red hot iron in a vacuum. He observed that the explosion of gunpowder in a vacuum created a pressure change, which could be measured using a mercury barometer. The experiment also showed the potential dangers of storing gunpowder in a vacuum, as the buildup of pressure could cause a container to explode.
