tldr: The author, J. Braxton Hicks, examines the structure and components of the eyes in various invertebrates. He identifies the similarities and differences in the parts of the eye and discusses the evolution of the eye's structure. The study reveals the homologies of the eye's components and challenges the idea that each type is formed on a distinct plan.
