tldr: 'Geo. Hadley explains the cause of trade winds by considering the Earth's diurnal motion and the Sun's action on the atmosphere. He proposes that the trade winds are a result of air being drawn towards the Equator from cooler regions, creating a balance between east and west winds. This understanding of trade winds has significant implications for navigation and weather patterns.'
