tldr: The authors studied the nodules found on the roots of leguminous plants and confirmed their parasitic nature. They discovered that the bacteroids within these nodules multiply and change shape, leading to the conclusion that they are members of the Schizomycetes. The authors also investigated the effects of Nitragin, a commercial product containing these bacteroids, on plant growth and found that it can increase yield in soil poor in nitrates.
