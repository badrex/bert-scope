tldr: This study investigates the core-electron binding energies of heavy rare-earth metals, from terbium to lutetium, and their surface and bulk oxides using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results reveal discrepancies in previously accepted values for heavier elements and provide insights into the effects of oxidation on the metals' spectra. The findings confirm the existence of additional structure predicted by the correlated hole theory and show that oxidation causes changes in the intensity ratios and splitting of the spectra.
