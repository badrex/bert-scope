tldr: The article presents a modulation theory solution for the near-resonant flow of a stratified fluid over topography. It shows that no steady-state can form upstream of the obstacle and constructs the upstream and downstream solutions as simple wave solutions of the modulation equations. The study is based on the forced Korteweg-de Vries equation and provides insights into the behavior of fluid flow near resonance.
