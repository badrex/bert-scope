tldr: In October 1726, the Reverend Mr. W. Derham observed a unique Lumen Boreale phenomenon, which involved streaming light and colors in the sky. This phenomenon was seen across England and parts of Europe. Derham described the various shapes, colors, and motions of the lights, as well as the confusion and alarm they caused in some areas. He also mentioned the connection between this event and earthquakes that occurred in England and Sicily around the same time.
