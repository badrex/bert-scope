tldr: The author examines the relationship between muscular irritability, cadaveric rigidity, and putrefaction in various cases, such as paralyzed muscles, decreased muscle temperature, and death by lightning or galvanism. They found that increased muscular irritability before death leads to delayed cadaveric rigidity and slower putrefaction, while decreased irritability results in the opposite effects.
