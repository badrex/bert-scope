tldr: 'This study investigates the changes in banding morph frequencies of Cepaea nemoralis and Cepaea hortensis snails from pre-iron Age to present day, relating these changes to known climatic changes in southern Britain. The results show a significant decrease of unbanded snails from pre-iron Age samples to present-day ones, suggesting that climate affects the frequencies of banding morphs, with unbanded and mid-banded snails being favored by better summers than those currently experienced in Britain.'
