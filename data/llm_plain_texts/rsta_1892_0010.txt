tldr: This article investigates the effect of collisions on the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of energy among a large number of mutually interacting bodies. The author examines the case of elastic spheres and demonstrates that the distribution remains unaffected by collisions, provided that the kinetic energy is conserved.
