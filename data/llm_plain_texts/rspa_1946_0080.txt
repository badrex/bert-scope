tldr: This article reviews the conflicting values for the heat of sublimation of carbon and the strengths assigned to chemical bonds involving carbon. The authors propose a scheme that reconciles these differences and brings all established experimental knowledge into alignment, emphasizing the importance of considering the energy levels of carbon atoms in different valence states. The article also discusses various methods for determining the energies associated with chemical linkages, such as thermochemical, spectroscopic, and kinetic methods.
