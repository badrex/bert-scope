tldr: The author's study of sea urchins in Suez found a lunar periodicity in their reproductive cycle, with gonads growing and shedding sexual products in correlation with the lunar month. This research debunked a common belief in Mediterranean countries that the size of marine invertebrates varied with the phases of the moon.
