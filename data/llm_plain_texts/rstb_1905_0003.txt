tldr: The author investigates the role of chemotaxis in the infection of plants by parasitic fungi. They found that certain substances attract the fungi's germ-tubes towards the host plant, while others repel them. This attraction is due to the presence of specific substances in the plant's cell sap, which influences the fungi's movement and infection process. The study provides insights into the mechanisms of parasitic fungi infection and potential ways to prevent it.
