tldr: The author investigates the gametogenesis and sex determination in the gall-fly, Neuroterus lenticularis. They discover two types of eggs: one with a diploid number of chromosomes (20) and the other with a haploid number (10). The presence of polar chromosomes indicates the reduced type of egg, while the absence of polar chromosomes indicates the unreduced type. This research helps to understand the mechanisms of sex determination in insects.
