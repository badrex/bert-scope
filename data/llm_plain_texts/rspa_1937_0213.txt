tldr: This article explores the interaction between atoms and molecules with solid surfaces, focusing on the activation of adsorbed atoms by metallic electrons. The authors propose a mechanism where energy from the conduction electrons in metals can activate adsorbed atoms, changing their vibrational states. They provide a theoretical framework for understanding this process and discuss the potential implications for surface chemistry and solid-state physics.
