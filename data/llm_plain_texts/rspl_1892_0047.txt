tldr: This paper examines the hippocampal region of the brain in anosmatic animals, such as whales and seals, and compares it to the hippocampus of a macrosmatic animal like the ox. The study reveals that the fascia dentata is absent in anosmatic animals and varies in development based on the size of their olfactory organs. This finding sheds light on the function of the hippocampal region and suggests a need for a revised nomenclature and definition of its parts.
