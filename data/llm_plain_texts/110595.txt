tldr: George Gulliver, Assistant Surgeon to the Royal Regiment of Horse Guards, conducted research on suppuration and its relation to blood. He discovered that healthy pus is composed of blood globules, while unhealthy pus contains broken down fibrin and is prone to putrefaction. This research helps establish the connection between unhealthy pus and fevers of the inflammatory or typhoid form.
