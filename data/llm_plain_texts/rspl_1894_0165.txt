tldr: This article reports on a study conducted by a committee to measure the death rate of selective destruction in crabs based on their dimensional deviations. They found that the death rate due to selective destruction was about 77,000 between the age corresponding to a carapace length of 7mm and maturity, as a consequence of deviations in frontal breadths. The study provides a method that can be applied to various cases, but it is not suitable for rapid changes induced by selection or environmental changes.
