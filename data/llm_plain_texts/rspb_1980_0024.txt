tldr: This article discusses the role of calcium ions in muscle contraction regulation. The author reviews the history of recognizing calcium ions as the sole regulatory factor of muscle contraction at the molecular level and the discovery of the troponin-tropomyosin system. The article also explores the myosin-linked regulation, vertebrate smooth muscle regulation, and the evolution of calcium ion's role in different kinds of cell motility.
