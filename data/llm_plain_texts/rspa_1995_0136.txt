tldr: The authors extend the CLM theorem to planar linear elastic materials of Cosserat (micropolar) type, showing that a shift in three out of four compliances is possible without changing the stress field. They also demonstrate that no shift is possible in case of a pseudo-continuum and in the second planar problem, which represents a micropolar generalization of the classical out-of-plane elasticity.
