tldr: The article discusses the consequences of trace element deficiencies, particularly manganese and zinc, on prenatal and neonatal development. Manganese deficiency can cause skeletal abnormalities, congenital ataxia, and abnormal brain function. Zinc deficiency during pregnancy leads to teratogenic effects, malformations, and depressed synthesis of essential components like pulmonary surfactant phospholipids. Both deficiencies can impact the immune system and overall growth of the neonate.
