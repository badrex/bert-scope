tldr: The authors developed a simple method for producing uniform pipettes that deliver consistent drops of liquid for use in serological and bacteriological work. They also created a constant-pressure apparatus to help control the drop rate and size. This method can be used for various applications, including counting bacteria, measuring small liquid quantities, and testing cultures and disinfectants.
