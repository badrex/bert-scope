tldr: The authors discovered a unique slowly inactivating potassium current in native oocytes of Xenopus laevis. This current is activated by depolarization and has properties different from previously described potassium currents in anuran oocytes. The study provides insights into the diverse ion channels present in oocytes and their potential functions in development.
