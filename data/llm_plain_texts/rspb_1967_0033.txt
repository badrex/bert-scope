tldr: The article discusses the structure and function of lysozyme, focusing on the relationship between its chemical structure and biological activity. The authors investigate the roles of specific amino acids and disulfide bonds in hen egg-white lysozyme and compare it to lysozymes from other species. They conclude that certain residues, such as histidine, cystine, and tryptophan, play crucial roles in maintaining the enzyme's activity.
