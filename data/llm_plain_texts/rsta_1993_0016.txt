tldr: Researchers have successfully grown thin film diamond on nickel substrates using local epitaxial growth from the vapor phase. The process involves depositing diamond on nickel at specific methane concentrations and substrate temperatures, resulting in diamond crystals with an epitaxial relation to the substrate. This discovery could lead to the development of single-crystal diamond films for various applications in material science.
