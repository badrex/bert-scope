tldr: Sewall Wright was a prominent geneticist and evolutionary biologist who made significant contributions to population genetics, physiological genetics, and the shifting balance theory of evolution. His work provided a quantitative basis for understanding evolution, variation in natural populations, and animal and plant breeding. Wright developed the method of path coefficients, analyzed gene frequency among populations, and proposed the shifting balance theory, which remains a topic of active research and debate.
