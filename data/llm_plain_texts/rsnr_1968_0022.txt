tldr: This article explores Newton's revival of the aether hypothesis and its connection to the explanation of gravitational attraction. The author discusses Newton's experiments with Hauksbee and the role of the aether in explaining various natural phenomena. Newton believed that the aether was an elastic medium and that it played a significant part in the attractive and repulsive forces between particles of matter.
