tldr: The spectrum of beryllium fluoride has been investigated, revealing six groups of bands in the ultra-violet range. The structure of the most intense band was studied in detail, showing three series of lines that deviate from the usual formula. The bands are similar to one of the groups of magnesium fluoride and are related to this group according to the formula for alkaline earth fluorides.
