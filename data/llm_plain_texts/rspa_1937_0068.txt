tldr: The authors investigate photochemical reactions in monolayers, focusing on the properties of the ketoimino linkage. They describe a method to study the reaction by observing the phase boundary potential and surface pressure. The study examines the photochemistry of stearic anilide in monolayers and discusses the reaction velocities and light intensities required for accurate investigation. The authors also discuss the challenges of measuring absorption spectra in monolayers and the importance of understanding the quantum efficiency of photochemical processes.
