tldr: Dr. Lyon Playfair discovered a new class of salts called nitroprussides, which have unique properties and reactions. These salts can be used as a test for the presence of sulphurets and have complex formulas. The nitroprussides are related to ordinary prussides, with one equivalent of cyanogen replaced by one equivalent of nitrous oxide.
