tldr: This article presents a new static spherically symmetric solution of Einstein's unified field equations and investigates the nature of the resulting fields. The author applies boundary conditions to this solution and others already known, finding that the only solution in the magnetic case corresponds to a massless magnetic pole, while all electric case solutions correspond to continuous charge distributions. The fields tend asymptotically to that of a point charge in classical theory. The author also examines the solutions' singularities and charge densities.
