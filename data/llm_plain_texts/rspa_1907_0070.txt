tldr: This article presents a study on the surface tension of liquids using the jet vibration method. The author, P. O. Pedersen and Lord Rayleigh, developed a reliable method for measuring the cross-section of the jet, which led to accurate calculations of surface tension. They also investigated the influence of amplitude on the period of vibration and introduced a new method for determining the wavelength using the jet as an optical image-forming system.
