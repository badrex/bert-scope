tldr: The authors determined the crystal and molecular structures of 5-bromo-2 deoxyuridine (BUDR) and 5-bromouridine (BUR) using X-ray crystallography. They found that the glycosidic bond length in BUDR is shorter than normal, and the conformation of the C5'-O5' bond is not the most commonly found. The study provides insights into the structures of halogenated deoxyuridines, which can be incorporated into DNA and cause biological changes.
