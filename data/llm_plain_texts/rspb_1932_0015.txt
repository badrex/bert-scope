tldr: The authors conducted experiments injecting acid dyes into cells in tissue culture to measure intracellular pH levels. They found that the cytoplasmic pH of various tumor cells, including mammary carcinoma, tar carcinoma, and Crocker sarcoma, was similar to that of normal cells, with values between 6.4 and 7.0. The authors also observed that the nucleus had a higher pH than the cytoplasm and that the colorimetric pH values remained consistent even when cells were injured.
