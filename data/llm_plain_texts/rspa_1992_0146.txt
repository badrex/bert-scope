tldr: The authors present analytical solutions for the Taylor-Couette flow problem, which involves the formation of vortex cells in the gap between two concentric rotating circular cylinders. These solutions are obtained using the mechanical part of the theory of a Cosserat point and are compared with experimental results from Benjamin and Mullin. The study provides insight into the nature of the problem and the behavior of fluid flow in the gap.
