tldr: Researchers induced porphyria in animals using drugs like sedormid and allyl-isopropyl-acetamide (A.I.A.). They observed that some animals excreted large amounts of porphobilinogen and uroporphyrin, while others produced only small amounts. The study compared the effects of these drugs on rabbits, fowls, and rats, and found that experimental porphyria appears to be due to an overproduction of porphyrins rather than an under-utilization of porphyrin pigments. The research also explored the role of the liver in porphyrin metabolism and the effects of reticulo-endothelial blockade, splenectomy, and barbiturate administration on experimentally induced porphyria in rabbits.
