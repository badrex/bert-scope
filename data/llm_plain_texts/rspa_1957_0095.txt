tldr: This article examines the second-order torsion and bending of isotropic elastic cylinders using complex variable notations. The authors reduce the problem to the solution of a single boundary-value problem involving two complex potential functions. They obtain a formula for the fractional elongation of the cylinder and discuss the change in the length of the line of centroids. The theory is applied to right circular cylinders, providing a deeper understanding of the behavior of these structures under stress.
