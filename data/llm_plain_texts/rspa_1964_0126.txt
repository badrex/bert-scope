revised_title: Isotope Effect in Hydrocarbon Flame Bands: Deuterium Substitution and Improved Spectral Analysis
semantic_tags:
  - Isotope effect
  - Hydrocarbon flame bands
  - Deuterium substitution
  - Spectroscopy
  - Vibrational frequencies
tldr: The author improved the apparatus for producing acetylene glow with atomic oxygen to obtain a large number of deutero-hydrocarbon flame bands without overlapping. The modified apparatus allowed for a more complete analysis of the isotopic bands, leading to the determination of vibrational frequencies and providing a better understanding of the emitter, which is likely HCO.
