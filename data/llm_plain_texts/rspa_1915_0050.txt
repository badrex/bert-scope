revised_title: 'Influence of Gas and Pole Material on Electrical Ignition of Gaseous Mixtures'

  - Jump-sparks
tldr: The author investigates the electrical ignition of gaseous mixtures using different materials for the poles and varying gas pressures. They found that the material of the poles has a significant influence on ignition, with platinum poles being the easiest to ignite. The results also show that the mechanism of ignition is different for break-sparks and jump-sparks, and the critical igniting voltage depends on the gas pressure and the material of the poles.
