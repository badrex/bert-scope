tldr: The study investigates the time course of experience-dependent synaptic switching and changes in visual connections in Xenopus laevis. Following the rotation of one larval eye, the pattern of functional connections linking the two optic tecta may change. The research found that the minimal time necessary for the emergence of a new pattern of intertectal connections was 8-12 days, and visual deprivation during this period prevented the development of a new pattern of intertectal connections.
