tldr: This article explores the use of stable isotope genealogy, particularly nitrogen and carbon isotopes, to study the origins and relationships between different meteorites. The authors discuss the potential of these isotopes to help understand the formation and evolution of the Solar System, as well as the nature of meteorite parent bodies. They present examples of iron meteorites, urelites, and SNC meteorites, and discuss the implications of their findings for the classification and understanding of these meteorites.
