tldr: The authors studied the shape and arrangement of cholinergic neurons in the rabbit retina using fluorescence microscopy and selective staining with the dye DAPI. They found that these neurons have two to seven primary dendrites and form a round or slightly oval dendritic tree. The dendritic tree's shape and size are continuously graded across the retina. The cholinergic neurons create a dense plexus of dendrites, with an overlap of dendritic fields that is an order of magnitude greater than other retinal neurons.
