tldr: This article explores the relationship between photosensitization and fluorescence in aqueous solutions. The author investigates the role of uranyl ions in photocatalyzing reactions, such as the photolysis of oxalic acid. The quantum efficiency for this process is determined, and the author finds that the energy absorbed by uranyl ions can either be emitted as fluorescent light or used to decompose oxalic acid. The study also shows that the addition of certain ions can inhibit the decomposition of oxalic acid, and the order of these ions is determined based on their ability to extinguish fluorescence.
