tldr: The authors critically examine the standing-gradient osmotic flow theory in epithelia, which suggests that any confined space delimited by a membrane with active salt transport and semi-permeable properties can function as a local osmotic coupling space. They find that the theory requires abnormally high osmotic permeability values for cell membranes, which are not observed experimentally or predicted on general theoretical grounds. This casts doubt on the intracellular and lateral spaces of fluid-transporting epithelia being local osmotic coupling spaces.
