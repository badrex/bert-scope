tldr: George Robert Sabine Snow was a notable botanist and plant physiologist who made significant contributions to the understanding of plant responses to external stimuli, particularly geotropism. His research focused on the conduction of geotropic excitation in roots and the response of roots to gravity. Snow's work was characterized by carefully designed experiments using minimal apparatus and materials, often involving delicate manipulation of living plants or plant organs.
