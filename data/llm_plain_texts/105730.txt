tldr: In a letter from 1763, Edward Gulston describes the violent earthquake that struck Chittagong, causing significant damage to buildings and the landscape. He provides a detailed account of the event, including the duration of the shaking, the damage caused, and the subsequent aftershocks. Gulston also expresses his hope that a similar event does not occur in Calcutta, as terraced houses would likely be destroyed.
