tldr: This article discusses the concept of triggered enzyme systems in blood plasma, which can be activated by physical, chemical, or enzymatic stimuli. The author introduces the idea of a "triggered enzyme" and proposes that these systems may exist in plasma and operate automatically when the right trigger is activated. The article aims to facilitate a discussion between researchers working on different but potentially related enzyme systems and their applications in blood clotting, biochemistry, physiology, and clinical settings.
