tldr: Researchers studied various strains of the trypanosome causing disease in humans in Nyasaland, isolated from wild animals. They compared the morphology of these strains and found that they are remarkably similar. The study also suggests that these strains belong to the same species, T. rhodesiense, and may be closely related to T. brucei.
