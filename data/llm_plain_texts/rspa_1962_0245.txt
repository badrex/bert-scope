tldr: The authors developed two methods to determine the scale height in the upper atmosphere using changes in satellite orbits. They found that the scale height decreased greatly between 1957 and 1961, likely due to a decline in solar activity. The methods provide a more accurate way to determine air density without needing to know the satellite's cross-sectional area.
