tldr: This study investigates the variation of the specific heat of aniline with temperature using a continuous flow electric method. The experiments provide reliable data on the specific heat's behavior in liquids with low vapor pressure near their freezing point. The findings contribute to understanding the thermal properties of aniline and its potential applications.
