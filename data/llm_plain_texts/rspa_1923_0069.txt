tldr: 'This study examines the oxidation of copper and reduction of copper oxide using a new method. The research finds that the rate of oxidation is influenced by oxygen pressure, with the rate being independent of pressure at higher levels. The authors propose that oxygen atoms condense on the copper surface and that direct oxidation forms the copper oxide. This explanation aligns with current theories on electron position changes during metal oxide formation.'
