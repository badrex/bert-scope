tldr: The authors conducted experiments on electric discharges using the chloride of silver battery. They observed the behavior of strata and their plasticity when influenced by obstacles or changes in temperature. The authors also demonstrated the viscosity of a stratum and the balance of forces holding molecules together. These findings contribute to the understanding of molecular interactions and the behavior of electric discharges.
