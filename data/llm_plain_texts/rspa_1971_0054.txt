tldr: The authors report measurements of a constant frequency oscillation in a current-carrying thermal plasma. They present a collision-free theory that includes a standing wave in the plasma and a sheath oscillation. The ion velocity distribution function is flattened at the plasma boundaries, which provides good agreement between the theory and experimental results.
