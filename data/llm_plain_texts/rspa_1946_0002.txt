tldr: The author develops field theories for electrons, positrons, and mesons using a five-dimensional approach. This method includes an additional degree of freedom, allowing for a more natural representation of the particles and their associated fields. The theory takes into account the fundamental lengths and masses associated with particles and includes the concept of quantization of electric charge. The author also discusses the use of matrices and covariant differentiation in the five-dimensional analysis.
