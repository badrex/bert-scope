tldr: The authors describe a method to condense volatile organosilicon compounds, hexamethyldisiloxane, and tetramethylsilane, into oligomeric and polymeric products using an electrical discharge in an ozonizer-type apparatus. They isolated and characterized a series of products using preparative scale gas-liquid chromatography, elemental analysis, infrared spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. The method provides a degree of control over the nature of the products, which can be resinous solids, heavy oils, or light oils in varying proportions.
