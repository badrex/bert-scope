tldr: This article investigates the absorption spectrum of a carbon monoxide flame and explores the phenomenon of afterburning in the combustion of carbon monoxide. The authors find that the molecules formed during combustion are initially in a highly excited state of internal vibration, and that the presence of moisture significantly affects the absorption and emission properties of the flame. The results provide a good interpretation of the experiments of Garner and colleagues on the effect of moisture and other catalysts on the infra-red emission of the flame.
