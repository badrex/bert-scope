tldr: The author discusses the fossil remains of the Megalania prisca, a large reptile from Australia. The analysis of the skeletal fragments, including a dorsal vertebra and pelvic bones, reveals similarities to Dinosauria and supports the classification of this species as a saurian reptile. This research contributes to the understanding of the megafauna that once inhabited Australia.
