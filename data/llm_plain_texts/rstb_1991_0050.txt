tldr: The article explores the implications of probabilistic secretion of transmitter quanta at synapses in neural networks, specifically focusing on granule cells and inhibitory interneurons. The study analyzes a model of stochastic secretion at synapses in networks that occur in the input to the cerebellum, hippocampus, and visual cortex. The results show that pattern separation and the control of output activity are greatly improved by the stochastic nature of quantal secretion at synapses.
