tldr: The article discusses the evolution of the Royal Society's obituary notices publication process. Initially, obituary notices were published yearly with the President's address in the "Proceedings of the Society." Later, they were published in the "Year-Book" and then in the "Proceedings." In 1932, the Council decided to publish obituary notices separately in a single annual number in November each year.
