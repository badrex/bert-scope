tldr: This article discusses the physical and chemical basis of muscular contraction and relaxation, focusing on the nature of the fibril. The authors explore the interaction between myosin and actin, the role of ATP, and the changes that occur in the muscle fiber during mincing. They also consider the molecular mechanism of contraction and the importance of understanding the assembly of proteins in the muscle fibril.
