tldr: The authors study the stereochemistry of diaryl-3,3'-diamino-N-butanes, focusing on their isomerism and crystallography. They synthesize various compounds and investigate their properties, including their melting points and optical activity. The study provides examples of conglomerates, racemoids, and pseudo-racemoids, demonstrating the different categories of externally compensated mixtures.
