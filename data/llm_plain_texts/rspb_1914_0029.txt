tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the functional correlation between the ovaries, uterus, and mammary glands in rabbits. They found that the growth of corpora lutea in the ovaries is associated with mammary gland hypertrophy, leading to milk production. The study also showed that the uterus is not necessary for mammary gland development. This research provides insights into the hormonal regulation of mammary gland growth and milk production in rabbits.
