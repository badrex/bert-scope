tldr: 'This article investigates the instability of a rotating liquid film with a free surface, considering the effects of viscosity, surface tension, and Coriolis acceleration. The authors analyze the stability of the film using a differential system of equations and find that for unstable or neutrally stable disturbances, the centripetal acceleration must be zero. The study provides insights into the behavior of liquid films in industrial processes, such as the paper industry and coating applications.'
