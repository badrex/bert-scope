tldr: The authors investigate the isomerism in cyanuric ethers, specifically focusing on methylic and ethylic compounds. They discover two new isomers, methylic cyanurate and dimethylic amidocyanurate, and discuss their properties and formation. The research also explores the relationship between these compounds and their ethylic counterparts.
