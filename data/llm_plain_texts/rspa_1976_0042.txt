tldr: The authors develop a method to enumerate and approximate the number of diagrams in many-body theory using group theory and combinatorial techniques. They provide a transversal theorem to simplify the problem of listing diagrams in higher orders and present an asymptotic formula for the number of diagrams. Additionally, they propose a simplified method for evaluating exchange-equivalent diagrams, which is useful for understanding the behavior of complex systems.
