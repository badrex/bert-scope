tldr: The author investigates the magnetic condition of iron ships and its accordance with theory. They found that iron ships behave as magnets with north and south poles, causing compass disturbances and changes. The magnetic condition of iron ships is influenced by their construction and the direction of the ship's head, which can result in westerly or easterly deviations in compass readings.
