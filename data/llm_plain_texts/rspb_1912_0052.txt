tldr: The authors conducted experiments on decerebrate preparations to study the effects of concurrent excitation and inhibition on reflex rhythm. They observed oscillations resulting from the combined effects of excitatory and inhibitory stimuli, which they attributed to the nerve impulses overcoming the opposing influence of inhibition. The findings have implications for understanding the complex interactions between excitation and inhibition in the nervous system.
