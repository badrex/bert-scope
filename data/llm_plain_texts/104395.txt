tldr: 'On December 11, 1739, Lord Beauchamp witnessed a fire-ball in the sky near London. The fire-ball was about a yard in diameter and had a tail of smoke. It appeared to descend from above and took its course to the east, eventually dividing into two heads. The event left a trail of smoke and a cloud that changed colors over time.'
