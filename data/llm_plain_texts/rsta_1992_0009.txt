tldr: This article explores the real and complex asymptotic symmetries in quantum gravity and their corresponding irreducible representations. The author demonstrates the relationships between these various groups and analyzes the irreducible unitary representations of the complexification of the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs group. The study of these symmetries and representations has potential applications to quantum gravity and is connected to the A, D, and E series of finite symmetry groups of regular polygons and polyhedra.
