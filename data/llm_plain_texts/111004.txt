tldr: The author, Gideon Algernon Mantell, studied the structure of the jaws and teeth of the Iguanodon, a gigantic herbivorous reptile, using a recently discovered dentary bone. He found that the teeth were arranged like those of ruminants and had a similar internal structure. The lower jaw had a unique construction, with a scoop-like expansion and a large number of blood vessel and nerve foramina. This indicated a large underlip and the presence of a prehensile tongue and fleshy lips, which were used to seize and crop foliage and branches of trees. The author also proposed the name Regnosaurus Northamptoni for a distinct genus or subgenus of Iguanodon.
