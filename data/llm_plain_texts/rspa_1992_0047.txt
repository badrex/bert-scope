tldr: This article explores the universality classes and fluctuations in disordered systems, focusing on the transmission of waves through disordered media. The authors develop a classification scheme that is independent of the medium's nature, allowing for a better understanding of the scaling of different properties with the thickness of the material. They apply this result to various systems, including one-dimensional, two-dimensional, and three-dimensional cases, and demonstrate its validity through numerical simulations.
