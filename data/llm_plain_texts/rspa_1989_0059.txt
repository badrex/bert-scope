revised_title: 'Molecular Beam Generation and Surface Physics: Evaporation Rates and Rotor-Propelled Beams'
semantic_tags:
  - Molecular beams
  - Surface physics
  - Evaporation rates
  - Rotor-propelled beams
  - Surface lifetimes
tldr: The author discusses the generation of molecular beams using rapidly rotating shafts and the connection between surface physics and molecular beam techniques. They propose a rule for estimating the time a molecule remains on the surface before evaporating and explore the efficiency of gas utilization and beam intensity in molecular beam generation.
