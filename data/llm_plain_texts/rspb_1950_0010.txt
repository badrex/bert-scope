tldr: Researchers have examined the molecular structure of the anti-pernicious anaemia factor, a substance found in liver, using crystallography. They discovered that the crystals contain the same molecular structure but have small variations in unit-cell dimensions and crystal habit, which are likely due to differences in solvent content and impurities. The crystals are orthorhombic and optically negative, with refractive indices that vary depending on the crystal orientation. The researchers determined that the molecular weight of the anti-pernicious anaemia factor is between 1360 and 1575, and they also observed a phenomenon of solvent loss from the crystals combined with the development of crystal disorder, which is common among proteins.
