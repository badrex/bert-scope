tldr: The authors conducted X-ray topographic investigations to study the changes in surface and bulk substructure during the incipient thermal decomposition of sodium chlorate monocrystals. They found that the degree of decomposition depends on the perfection of the sample, with more perfect crystals suffering lower mass loss. The study revealed that dislocations play a minor role in the nucleation of the decomposition process in the bulk, while strained regions in the lattice act as potential nuclei. Impurity-doped crystals show enhanced decomposition.
