tldr: 'The authors investigate intersexuality in the moth Lymantria dispar and reassess previous findings by Goldschmidt. They suggest that the observed intersexuality is due to the Haldane effect, a result of genic imbalance, rather than sex reversal. The study provides evidence that the excess of males in Goldschmidt's classic cross is due to the Haldane effect and not to sex reversal.'
