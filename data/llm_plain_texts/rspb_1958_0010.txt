tldr: The authors conducted experiments on rats to study the effects of thioacetamide and "butter yellow" on liver health. They observed histological and biochemical changes in the rats' livers and found that these chemicals caused damage to parenchymal cells, proliferation of bile duct tissue, and a drop in the mitochondrial fraction. These changes led to the development of cholangiocarcinomas and hepatomas in the rats.
