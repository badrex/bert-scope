tldr: The author conducted extensive experiments on various explosives, including cordite, nitrocellulose, and Italian and Norwegian Ballistites. They analyzed the gases produced by the explosion, the temperature and pressure generated, and the density of the explosives. The author found significant differences in the composition and properties of the gases produced by each explosive, as well as the temperature and pressure generated during the explosion. The results provide valuable insights into the behavior of explosives in gun chambers and their potential applications.
