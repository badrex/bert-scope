tldr: The author investigates the structure of amoeboid protoplasm and compares it to the nature of contractile processes in muscular tissue. They discover that protoplasm is composed of two distinct substances: spongioplasm and hyaloplasm. Spongioplasm has a reticular arrangement and stains with hematoxylin, while hyaloplasm is structureless, has little affinity for stains, and is highly labile and fluent. The author suggests that the movements of cells are produced by the active flowing of hyaloplasm, rather than the contraction of spongioplasm.
