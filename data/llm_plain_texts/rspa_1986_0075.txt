  - Porous media flows

  - Fluid dynamics
  - Darcy-Rayleigh number
  - Cavity aspect ratio
tldr: The article examines steady cavity flows in porous media driven by a horizontal temperature gradient in the intermediate limit when the Rayleigh number is comparable with the cavity aspect ratio. The study focuses on the diffusion-dominated core flow and the end structures, providing insights into the generation of additional end circulations and predicting cavity heat transfer. The research has applications in geothermal energy extraction, convection in the Earth's mantle, dispersion of pollutants, and solar-power collectors.
