tldr: The authors present a method called the base equation technique to construct multiple soliton solutions of the double sine Gordon equation. They demonstrate that a superposition of simple solutions of the Klein Gordon equation can be used to create solutions of the double sine Gordon equation, with certain restrictions. The soliton solutions have the remarkable property of collapsing to a single soliton when the wave vectors are parallel.
