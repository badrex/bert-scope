tldr: 'The Overhauser effect is a phenomenon where nuclear spins are coupled with unpaired electronic spins in substances like metals, semiconductors, and paramagnetic solutions. This effect can lead to large nuclear polarization and has been observed in metallic sodium, lithium, silicon, and many paramagnetic solutions. The Overhauser effect can be used to enhance nuclear signals and provide detailed information on nuclear relaxation mechanisms.'
