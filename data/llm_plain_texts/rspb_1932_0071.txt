revised_title: 'The Toxic Effects of Large Doses of Pure Calciferol on Dogs'

tldr: The authors conducted experiments on dogs to study the effects of large doses of pure calciferol (vitamin D). They found that excessive doses of calciferol caused toxic effects, including hypercalcemia, gastrointestinal issues, and bone decalcification. The results showed that pure calciferol was toxic to dogs, even when administered intravenously, and that the toxic effects were similar to those produced by parathyroid hormone excess.
