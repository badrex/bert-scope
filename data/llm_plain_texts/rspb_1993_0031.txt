tldr: The study conducted breeding experiments with the polyploid freshwater snail Ancylus fluviatilis to determine outcrossing rates at the individual level. The results showed an overall outcrossing rate of 2.3%, providing genetic evidence for a breeding system similar to that of self-pollinating plants. This research contributes to understanding the evolutionary significance of self- and cross-fertilization in species.
