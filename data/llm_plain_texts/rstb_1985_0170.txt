revised_title: Paraquat Toxicity: Mechanism of Lung Damage and Biochemical Consequences
semantic_tags:
  - Paraquat toxicity
  - Lung damage
  - Oxidative stress
  - Radical reactions
  - Herbicide poisoning
tldr: This article discusses the toxicity of paraquat, a contact herbicide, and its impact on the lung. Paraquat accumulates in the alveolar type I and type II epithelial cells, undergoing a one-electron reduction to form a free radical that reacts with molecular oxygen, leading to the production of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide. This causes oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, and cell death. The article explains the biochemical changes and pathways involved in paraquat toxicity and the role of lung accumulation in the damage.
