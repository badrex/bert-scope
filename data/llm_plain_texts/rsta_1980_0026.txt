revised_title: 'Magnetic Polarity Dating of Tectonic Events at Passive Continental Margins'
semantic_tags:
  - Geomagnetic polarity dating
  - Tectonic events
  - Continental margins
  - Deep drilling results
  - Paleomagnetic studies
tldr: This article discusses the use of magnetic polarity dating to determine the age of sediments in passive continental margins. The authors present results from deep drilling in the Atlantic Ocean, using a combination of magnetic and biostratigraphic studies to date the sediments and understand the geological evolution of these margins.
