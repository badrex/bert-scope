tldr: This study measures the collision efficiency of ethyl radicals in a gaseous system using a molybdenum oxide surface as a radical trap. The researchers found that the collision efficiency for ethyl radicals in the gas phase is approximately 0.5, which is in agreement with available data. This discovery helps to better understand the interactions of alkyl radicals and their role in chemical reactions.
