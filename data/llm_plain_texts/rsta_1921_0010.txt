tldr: This paper presents a theoretical and experimental study of the motion of a spinning shell through the air. The authors describe the motion of the spinning shell under the effects of gravity and the reaction of the air. They compare the theoretical results with experimental data and determine the force system acting on the shell. The study provides valuable insights into the aerodynamics of projectiles and has implications for gunnery and military applications.
