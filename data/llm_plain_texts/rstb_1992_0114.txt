tldr: The article discusses the use of model-based vision in understanding traffic scenes by relying on a priori knowledge of the scene, position of the camera, and expectations about the shapes and movements of vehicles. This approach allows for robust object recognition and three-dimensional understanding of the scene, leading to potential applications in machine vision for outdoor conditions. The author also speculates about the possible role of similar model-based processing in human vision.
