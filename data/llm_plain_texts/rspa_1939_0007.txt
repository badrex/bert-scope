tldr: The authors investigated the infra-red spectrum of mono-deuteromethane and conducted a chemical synthesis to prepare the gas. They measured a simple band at 9021 cm and analyzed the molecular structure of the deuteromethane, providing insights into the methane molecule's structure and interaction phenomena.
