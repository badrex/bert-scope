tldr: The authors develop an effective algorithm to solve Diophantine equations, specifically focusing on the equation y, where y is an irreducible binary form with integer coefficients and degree at least 1. They provide an explicit bound for the size of all solutions in integers and prove that for any integer, all solutions of the equation have absolute values at most 1.
