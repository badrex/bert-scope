tldr: This study investigates the perceptual compensations that occur in amblyopia, a disruption to early visual development. It examines how amblyopes perceive contrast and how their contrast thresholds may be raised without significant impairment to high-contrast perception. The research explores the concept of contrast recruitment and its possible physiological explanations, such as the recruitment of different-frequency neurons, different-threshold neurons, or a gain change in the response-contrast function of individual neurons. The findings suggest that normal contrast perception may be subserved by more than one contrast mechanism, and in amblyopia, the more sensitive contrast channel (lower threshold) is selectively affected.
