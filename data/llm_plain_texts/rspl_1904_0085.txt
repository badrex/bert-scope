tldr: This article investigates the role of oxygen in the combustion of hydrocarbons and electrolytic gas. The author suggests that oxygen acts as a catalyst, promoting the hydroxylation of hydrocarbons and retarding combustion. The presence of water plays a crucial role in the process, as it helps to control the amount of active oxygen available for combustion. The author also discusses the formation of carbon dioxide as a final product of combustion and the influence of hydrogen in promoting combustion.
