tldr: This article outlines the evolutionary history and taxonomy of the Heteroconchia, specifically the infaunal descendants of the Cycloconchidae, including superfamilies Cycloconchacea to Chamacea. The study traces the subclass Heteroconchia's origins from the earliest Ordovician and discusses the relationships and modifications of the various superfamilies. The article also explores the bivalves' spread into fresh water and the changes that occurred within the Heteroconchia during the Permian and Triassic periods.
