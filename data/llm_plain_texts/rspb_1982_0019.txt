tldr: The study investigates the photoresponses of structurally identified amacrine cells in the turtle retina. Intracellular recordings were obtained from amacrine cells that were later identified morphologically by horseradish peroxidase injection. The results show a correlation between the time course of the photoresponses and the distribution of the cell processes across the inner plexiform layer. The study concludes that different structural organization of inputs is responsible for the two main functional types of amacrine cells.
