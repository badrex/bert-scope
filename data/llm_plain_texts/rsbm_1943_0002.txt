tldr: Walcot Gibson was a prominent geologist who contributed significantly to the understanding of coalfields in the UK. He worked on mapping and investigating coalfields, including the South Wales, North Staffordshire, and South Derbyshire coalfields. His work helped establish the relationship between Keele group and Carboniferous formations and provided valuable insights into concealed coalfields. Gibson's expertise in coalfield investigations led to the publication of two books, 'Geology of Coal and Coal Mining' and 'Coal in Great Britain'. He was awarded the Murchison Medal by the Geological Society and elected to the Royal Society for his contributions to economic geology.
