tldr: The authors discovered four new band systems in the hydrogen molecule (H2) resulting from transitions from four new triplet states to the 2p3n state. They analyzed the band systems and discussed their electronic configurations, providing insights into the behavior of the hydrogen molecule and its excited states.
