tldr: This study examines the effects of a cold environment on the maternal performance and food consumption of mice. Mice from two different stocks were kept at -3째C and 21째C, and their food consumption, body weight, and reproductive success were compared. The results showed that mice from both stocks at -3째C had lower body weight, consumed more food relative to body weight, and had fewer offspring with higher mortality rates compared to mice at 21째C. The old-stock mice, with generations reared in the cold, had better reproductive success and food efficiency than the new-stock mice. The study suggests that cold adaptation may improve reproductive success and food utilization in mice.
