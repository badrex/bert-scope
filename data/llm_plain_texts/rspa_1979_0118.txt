tldr: The authors develop a theory for rotationally inelastic collisions between orbitally degenerate molecules and open-shell atoms, focusing on the molecules OH and CH. They explain how these collisions can lead to population inversion necessary for interstellar maser action. The study considers various collision partners and their effects on the molecules' -doublet levels, providing qualitative predictions for population inversion and implications for maser action.
