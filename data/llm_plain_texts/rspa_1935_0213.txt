tldr: The authors examined the fine structure in the arc spectrum of iodine using a high-frequency electrodeless discharge and a variable gap Fabry-Perot interferometer. They determined the nuclear spin of iodine to be 5/2 and analyzed the fine structures in the lines of the first spark spectrum. The study revealed that the upper terms in the lines had a large interval factor, causing excessive overlapping of the fine structure components. The authors also found that the 6s 4P term was perturbed by a term with J = 1, which explained the failure of a normal Fisher-Goudsmit diagram.
