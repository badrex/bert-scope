tldr: This study investigates the nucleation and crystal growth of calcium carbonate in the presence of organized stearic acid monolayers. The researchers found that the structure, morphology, and crystallographic orientation of the crystals are controlled by nucleation at the negatively charged organic surface. The results provide insights into the role of dynamics in regulating inorganic crystallization at organized organic surfaces.
