tldr: This study investigates the development of resistance to the antibiotic sulphathiazole in Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. The researchers found that the resistant strains have metabolic differences compared to sensitive strains, such as the accumulation of p-aminobenzoic acid and the synthesis of folic acid. The findings suggest that drugs and toxic agents can act as negative and positive catalysts, leading to the evolution of resistance mechanisms in living cells.
