tldr: This study investigates the differential aspects of colour and brightness coding in the human central nervous system using visual evoked potentials. The authors found a dominant N87 component for colour changes from yellow to brighter red colours, which was less pronounced for green and absent for yellow luminance changes. The data suggest that the peripheral visual system violates Barlow's economy principle to gain additional capacity for transmitting red-green information in the same structural unit as spatial information. The study also discusses the purpose of combined chromatic and achromatic information processing in retinal X cells and the decoding of this information in the visual cortex.
