tldr: This study uses electron microscopy to analyze the tail structure of the bandicoot spermatozoon. The researchers identify various structures within the tail, including the axial filament complex, peripheral fibrils, connecting laminae, spiral sheath, tail sheath, and terminal zone. These findings contribute to the understanding of sperm movement and reproductive biology in bandicoots.
