revised_title: 'Cool Flame Chemistry of Alkylperoxy Radical Isomerization in Hexane Combustion'

  - Alkylperoxy radicals
  - Cool flames
  - Combustion chemistry
  - O-heterocyclic compounds
  - Intramolecular rearrangement
tldr: The authors studied the combustion of n-hexane and found that O-heterocyclic compounds are the main products of the intramolecular rearrangement of hexylperoxy radicals. These compounds are formed in larger quantities under cool flame conditions and provide information about the susceptibility of alkylperoxy radicals to intramolecular hydrogen abstraction. The results help to understand the chain-branching process leading to cool flames.
