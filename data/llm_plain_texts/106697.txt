tldr: 'This article presents a series of experiments conducted by William Nicholson on the nature of electricity and its excitation. Nicholson discovered that the silk used in his experiments played a crucial role in the electrification process, and he also observed the behavior of electricity within a glass cylinder. He found that the internal surface of the cylinder attracted electricity during the friction process, and that the strength of the excitation affected the behavior of the electricity. Nicholson's findings contributed to a better understanding of electricity and its properties.'
