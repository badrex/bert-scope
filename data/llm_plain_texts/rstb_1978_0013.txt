tldr: The authors analyze the Silurian fossil Placocystites forbesianus and argue that it is a primitive chordate with an echinoderm-type skeleton. They discuss its significance in understanding the ancestry of vertebrates and the evolution of calcichordates. The fossil's anatomy provides insights into the early stages of vertebrate development.
