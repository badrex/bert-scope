tldr: The authors studied the structure of organic ionic melt mesophases in alkali carboxylate salts, focusing on sodium isovalerate and sodium n-butyrate. They found that the mesophases have distinct characteristics, such as long spacing reflexions and electrostatic sandwiches, which provide insight into the molecular packing and thermal behavior of these compounds. This research contributes to understanding the mechanisms of melting in ionic solids and the potential technological applications of these novel fluids.
