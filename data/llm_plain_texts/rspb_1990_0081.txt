tldr: The authors found that the isopenicillin N synthetase (IPNS) gene, responsible for making antibiotic compounds, has been transferred from bacteria to fungi. This is the first example of such a transfer from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. The study compared the evolutionary distances between bacterial and fungal IPNS genes and 5S rRNA genes, showing that the IPNS genes are much closer, supporting a horizontal gene transfer.
