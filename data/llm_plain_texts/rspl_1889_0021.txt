tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the electrical conductivity and properties of sulfur. They discovered that sulfur's conductivity increases with temperature and undergoes changes in its properties at specific temperatures. The author also investigated the effect of light on sulfur and found that it may have similar properties to selenium, another element in the same group of the periodic table.
