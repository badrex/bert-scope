tldr: This study investigates long-period meteor wind oscillations and their correlation with tropospheric parameters. The authors found significant correlation between phenomena at different atmospheric levels, suggesting a coupling mechanism between the lower and upper atmosphere. The results provide insights into the dynamics of the Earth's atmosphere and the potential for further research on atmospheric coupling.
