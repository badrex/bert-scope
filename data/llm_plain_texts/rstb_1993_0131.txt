tldr: The article discusses the role of the CD4 lymphocyte glycoprotein in T cell development and activation. It explains how CD4 helps in the positive selection of helper cells and enhances the avidity of the T cell receptor (TCR) and MHC interaction. The study also highlights the importance of CD4 in thymic selection events and its impact on the immune system.
