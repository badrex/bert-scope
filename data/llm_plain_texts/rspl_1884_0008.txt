tldr: The author investigated the unequal electric conduction-resistance in cathodes during electrolysis experiments. They found that different metals exhibit varying resistance to the passage of current into them, and this resistance is not solely due to heat, current absorbed in liberating hydrogen, or chemical action. The author is further studying the nature of this resistance and its relation to various circumstances.
