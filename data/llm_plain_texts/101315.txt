tldr: This article describes two experiments conducted in Italy. The first experiment involved transfusing the blood of a lamb into a spaniel, resulting in the spaniel's improved health and hearing. The second part discusses a new microscope invented by Eustachio Divini, which allowed the observation of an extremely small animal, smaller than any previously seen.
