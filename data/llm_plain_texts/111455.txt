tldr: The author, Samuel Haughton, studied the physical structure of the Old Red Sandstone in Waterford County, focusing on cleavage, joint surfaces, and faults. He identified two systems of conjugate faults and four systems of joint and cleavage planes. Haughton proposed that the cleavage planes were developed while the rock was soft due to pressure, while joint planes formed when the rock was hard due to shrinking. He believed that his method could be applied to other districts and that his findings would support the mechanical theory of slaty cleavage.
