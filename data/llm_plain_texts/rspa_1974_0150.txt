  - Crystallography
  - Diamond defects
tldr: This study investigates the differences in crystal perfection and impurity content between diamond regions grown on {111} facets and those grown on non-crystallographic surfaces. The research uses X-ray methods to trace growth epochs and analyze the differences in crystal imperfections and impurity content in various growth sectors. The findings provide insights into the growth patterns and defects in natural diamonds.
