revised_title: Oligosaccharide Branching in Glycoproteins: Biosynthetic Mechanisms and Possible Biological Functions
semantic_tags:
  - Glycoprotein synthesis
  - Oligosaccharide branching
  - Biosynthesis control
  - Enzymatic factors
  - Protein-oligosaccharide interaction
tldr: This article discusses the biosynthesis and branching mechanisms of glycoproteins, focusing on the enzymatic factors that control the assembly of N- and O-glycosyl oligosaccharides. The authors describe three main control points in the biosynthesis process and highlight the importance of protein-oligosaccharide interactions in various biological functions, such as cell-cell interactions, differentiation, and susceptibility to hormones, drugs, and toxins.
