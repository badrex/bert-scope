tldr: The authors explore cylindrical wave solutions in general relativity, demonstrating that these waves can propagate energy. They also study the interior and exterior field of a static cylinder of approximately constant density and discuss the energy transfer by pulse waves. This research contributes to the understanding of gravitational waves and their effects on matter distribution.
