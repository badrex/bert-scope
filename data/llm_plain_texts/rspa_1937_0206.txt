tldr: The author presents a method for creating single crystal wires of high melting point metals without the need for high-temperature furnaces. The method involves maintaining the wire at a high uniform temperature and applying a traveling temperature gradient. This technique has been successfully applied to create single crystals of a-iron and molybdenum.
