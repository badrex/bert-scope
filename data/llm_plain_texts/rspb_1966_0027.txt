tldr: The author discusses the fine structure of chromosomes and the challenges in understanding their organization and replication. They describe the use of electron microscopy to reveal details of chromosome components, such as fibrils, and the importance of recognizing the differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic genetic systems. The author emphasizes the need for further research to develop a clear understanding of chromosome organization at the molecular level.
