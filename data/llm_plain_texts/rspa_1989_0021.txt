tldr: This article presents a study on wave propagation in transversely isotropic elastic media, focusing on the special case where a5 equals zero and the inextensible limit. The author derives a closed-form expression for the surface-wave function for any orientation of the axis relative to the surface-wave basis. The inextensible limit is explored, and the secular equation for surface waves is retrieved directly. The article also discusses the exceptional configurations and their properties.
