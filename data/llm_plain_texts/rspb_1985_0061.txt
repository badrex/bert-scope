tldr: The study investigates the adaptation of the motion-sensitive neuron H1 in the fly Lucilia cuprina. It shows that the adaptation occurs locally and is governed by contrast frequency, which is the temporal frequency of a moving grating. This adaptation helps the neuron to better encode motion signals and improve its sensitivity to motion. The research has implications for understanding motion sensitivity in both insects and humans.
