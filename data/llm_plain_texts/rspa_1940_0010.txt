tldr: The authors conducted experiments using the Cambridge cyclotron to study the production of radium E and polonium by deuteron bombardment of bismuth. They confirmed previous findings and discovered a direct production of polonium. The study also determined the variation of yield with energy for these nuclear reactions.
