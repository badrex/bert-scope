tldr: This article discusses the morphology, mechanics, and Quaternary history of valley slopes and cliffs in southern England, focusing on cambering and valley bulging in the Gwash valley at Empingham, Rutland. The authors investigate the lithostratigraphic sequence, internal structure, and the effects of cambering and valley bulging on the Upper Lias formation. They also examine the topography, geological sequence, and the role of superficial structures in the development of the valley.
