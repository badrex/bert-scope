tldr: This article discusses a scientific debate about the presence of potassium in protagon, a brain substance. The author, Henry E. Roscoe, analyzes the content of two samples of protagon and finds a much lower percentage of potassium than what Dr. Thudichum claimed. Roscoe explains that the presence of potassium in the first crystallizations of protagon is expected, and argues against using this as evidence against the individuality of protagon.
