tldr: In this article, Lord Kelvin discusses the generation of longitudinal waves in ether and proposes an experimental arrangement to test the hypothesis. He suggests using a metal plate with insulated electrodes to create pressural disturbances or longitudinal waves. The experiment could potentially demonstrate the truth of Rontgen's hypothesis regarding his discovery of X-rays. The author also considers alternative explanations for the observed phenomena and emphasizes the importance of further research in this field.
