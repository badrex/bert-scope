tldr: The author, Richard Forster, conducted experiments to test the harmlessness of noxious animals, specifically the viper and slow-worm, by observing their bites on people. He found that the slow-worm's bite was harmless, and the fear of these animals could be unfounded. This research could help remove the abhorrence of these creatures and save the lives of many innocent, potentially useful animals.
