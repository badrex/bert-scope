tldr: 'The author revises the values of some nuclear reaction energies to make them consistent with more accurately known values. They use equations and atomic weights from Bethe and Oliphant, Kempton, and Rutherford to determine the probable energy values of nuclear reactions. The revised values provide improved accuracy for some energies and satisfy six relations.'
