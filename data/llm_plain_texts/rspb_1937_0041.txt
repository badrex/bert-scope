revised_title: 'Pituitary Control of Alimentary Blood Flow and Secretion: The Effect of Vasoconstriction on Gastric Secretion'
semantic_tags:
  - Gastric secretion
  - Vasoconstriction
  - Pituitary extract
  - Blood flow
  - Alimentary system
tldr: This study investigates the relationship between blood flow and gastric secretion in cats. The researchers found that an increase in blood flow accompanies gastric secretion, and that pituitary extract inhibits both blood flow and gastric secretion. Cold water and vasoconstrictor substances also inhibit gastric secretion by reducing blood flow to the stomach.
