tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the correction for temperature in pendulum experiments at the Harton Colliery. Two pendulums were placed in separate rooms with controlled temperatures, and observations were made over several series of experiments. The results suggest that the earth's mean density is 6,809 when a certain correction is applied, and the author discusses the impact of the earth's rotation and ellipticity on the experiment's results.
