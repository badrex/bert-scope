tldr: The article analyzes the problem of calculating electrostatic energies in ionic crystals and shows that the electrostatic energy of a unit cell of a crystal is composed of a shape-independent part and a shape-dependent part. The shape-dependent part is zero if the unit cell's dipole moment is zero. The total electrostatic energy of a piece of crystal is the unit cell energy multiplied by the number of unit cells, plus corrections proportional to the surface area of the crystal. The surface corrections are calculated explicitly for a finite cube of a simple cubic crystal. The article discusses the role of surface layers in the bulk electrostatic energy of a piece of ionic crystal and the relation of this bulk energy to a shape-independent Madelung constant.
