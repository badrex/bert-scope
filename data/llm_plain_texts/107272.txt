tldr: The author, Thomas Andrew Knight, conducted experiments on fruit trees and animals to study the influence of male and female parents on their offspring. He found that the character of the offspring is often more influenced by the female parent, and that the sex of the offspring is also determined by the female parent. These findings have implications for plant and animal breeding.
