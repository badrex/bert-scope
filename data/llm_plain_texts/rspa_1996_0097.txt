tldr: The authors present a method to estimate the power transmitted between three interconnected membranes undergoing small amplitude oscillations when one membrane is excited by a point force. They use a matching technique and an integral equation method to calculate the power flow between the membranes. The methods can be extended to deal with more than three interconnected membranes or acoustic regions.
