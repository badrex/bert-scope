tldr: 'The author, Roger Pickering, shares his findings on the use of fossil shells, specifically those of the Buccinum vulgar or Whilk, as a form of manure for improving agricultural land. He describes the collection of these shells in Woodbridge and their successful use in improving crop yields. He also expresses his regret that this method of land improvement is not more widely known and encourages others to conduct experiments and share their observations with the Royal Society.'
