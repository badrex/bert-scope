tldr: Edward Lhwyd describes a remarkable sea plant found near Llan Danwg in Meirionydshire, Wales. The plant has hollow stems filled with a reddish liquid and drooping flowers. Lhwyd also mentions the discovery of a unique marble with a pattern resembling small oranges, which could be used for inlaying work. Additionally, he discusses the availability of alum and copperas in Pembrokeshire, Caermarthenshire, and Meirionydshire for potential mining and industrial projects.
