tldr: This study investigates the development of the calcareous lantern in Echinus miliaris, focusing on the growth and formation of its ossicles. The author describes the process of lantern ossicle development, including the jaw, epiphyses, and rotula, and provides insights into their morphology and orientation in the adult sea urchin. The research contributes to the understanding of echinoderm development and paleobiology.
