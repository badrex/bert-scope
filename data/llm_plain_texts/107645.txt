tldr: In this article, the authors describe their experiments with fluid chlorine, a previously unknown state of the element. They discovered that when hydrate of chlorine is exposed to heat and pressure, it decomposes into two fluid substances: a faint yellow fluid, which is a solution of chlorine in water, and a heavy bright yellow fluid, which is pure liquid chlorine. The authors also discuss the properties of liquid chlorine, such as its volatility, volatility, and reactivity with other substances.
