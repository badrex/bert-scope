tldr: The authors develop three techniques for deducing near crack tip singular fields in diffusive elastic solids using Biot's theory. They employ a pseudo energy-momentum tensor, reciprocal theorems, and dual functions to relate near crack tip fields to far field information. These methods can be used in conjunction with numerical methods for solving complex problems in poroelasticity and fracture mechanics.
