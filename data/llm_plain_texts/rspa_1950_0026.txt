tldr: The author analyzes the electronic structures of molecules containing oxy-sulphur bonds using molecular orbital theory. They discuss the physical and chemical properties of sulphur dioxide, sulphur trioxide, and other related molecules based on these structures. The author concludes that oxy-sulphur linkages are best described as double-bonded, and a successful correlation between molecular orbital criterion of bond strengths and oxy-sulphur bond force constants is established.
