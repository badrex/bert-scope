tldr: The authors developed a simple and affordable method to prevent death from snake bites using permanganate of potash. They designed an instrument that combines a lancet and a container for the antidote, making it easily accessible and practical for common use. Experiments showed that the permanganate of potash effectively neutralized venom from various snake species, and the treatment was tested successfully on animals with cobra and Daboia Russelii venom.
