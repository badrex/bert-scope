tldr: 'The study investigates the changes in subfossil chrysophyte flora in lakes of Sweden, Norway, and Scotland. The research shows that recent acidification has affected lakes Lilia Oresjon and Verevatn, with a shift in chrysophyte community from alkaliphilous-alkalibiontic to acidophilous-acidobiontic species. The findings correlate with the history of acidification inferred from diatom analysis. In contrast, Royrtjorna did not show a change in the chrysophyte community, which is consistent with the diatom data indicating insignificant pH decrease over the last 100 years.'
