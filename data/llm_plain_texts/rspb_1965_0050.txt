tldr: The study investigates the diurnal variation in the excretion of calcium and strontium in two male subjects on a normal diet and activity. A marked 4-hourly variation in excretion was observed, with the general pattern differing between the two subjects. The results indicate a natural nycthemeral variation in renal excretion of calcium and strontium, but this rhythm may be influenced by external factors such as exercise and internal reservoirs like the 'exchangeable pool'. The findings have implications for understanding renal function and the regulation of calcium and strontium in the body.
