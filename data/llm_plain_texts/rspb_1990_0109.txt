tldr: The authors discovered that glutamate receptors in rod bipolar cells are linked to a cyclic GMP cascade via a G-protein. This connection may be similar to the phototransduction process in rods, with cGMP acting as the second messenger, opening ion channels. The findings suggest that the glutamate receptors' activation through G-proteins helps regulate intracellular cGMP levels, which in turn affects the opening of subsynaptic membrane channels in rod bipolar cells.
