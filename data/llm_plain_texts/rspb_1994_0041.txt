tldr: This study analyzes the full DNA sequence of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene in the family Camelidae, providing insights into the molecular evolution, relationships, and domestication of camelids. The results support the hypothesis that the alpaca is a domesticated form of the vicuna and reveal that hybridization has occurred in the ancestry of both domesticated camelids.
