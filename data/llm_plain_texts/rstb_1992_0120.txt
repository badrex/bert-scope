tldr: This study investigates the extent of collateral arborizations of entering sensory fibers in the rat spinal cord using anatomical and electrophysiological methods. The results show that these long-range afferents can penetrate grey matter, with sural afferents reaching up to four segments caudal to their root entry and sciatic nerve fibres located in S4, six segments caudal to their entry point. The findings suggest a close agreement between the caudal penetration of long-ranging afferents using both anatomical and electrophysiological methods.
