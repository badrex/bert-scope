tldr: This study investigates the two-dimensional motion of a viscous liquid down a perturbed inclined plane under gravity. The authors compare theoretical predictions from various models, including finite-element approximations and lubrication approximations, with experimental measurements of free-surface profiles. They find that a lubrication approximation accounting for surface tension and inertial effects provides a good representation of the experimental results for a broader range of Reynolds numbers.
