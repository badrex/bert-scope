tldr: The authors investigated the relationship between brain damage and global stereopsis, the ability to perceive depth using retinal disparities. They found that removing the inferotemporal cortex in rhesus monkeys impaired global stereopsis, suggesting that this area of the brain plays a crucial role in this process. This finding is related to previous research with human patients and the receptive field properties of neurons in the inferotemporal cortex of monkeys.
