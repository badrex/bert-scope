tldr: The authors studied the behavior of extra chromosomes, called B-chromosomes, in Sorghum plants. They discovered that these chromosomes are lost in the radicle and shoot tissues but are maintained in the anthers and ovaries. The presence of B-chromosomes affects pollen grain mitosis, causing abnormal nucleic acid cycles. The findings reveal that the activity of inert chromosomes is non-specific and has implications for understanding chromosome behavior in plants and animals.
