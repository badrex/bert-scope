tldr: This article discusses the phenomenon of optical bistability and the formation of solitons in ring resonators. The authors report on a novel nonlinear dynamical process where an optical beam switches between low and high transmission states in a bistable optical ring resonator. They explore the evolution of spatial rings and solitons in both saturable and Kerr media, and present preliminary numerical results for a two-dimensional transverse-beam profile.
