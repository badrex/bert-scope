tldr: The authors investigated the reduction phenomena in animals and plants, focusing on the process of reduction divisions. They discovered that the previous interpretations of the process were incorrect and provided a new explanation for the formation of reduced chromosomes. The study also revealed the importance of the synaptic rest phase in the reproductive cycle and the differences between heterotype and homotype divisions.
