tldr: The author investigates the genetic and physiological factors controlling floral initiation in wheat, using environmental treatments and genetic stocks. They discovered a sensitive period for individual florets and found that the timing and course of development in environmentally or genetically induced sterile florets are the same. This research sheds light on the processes controlling the differentiation and development of normal florets, with implications for wheat breeding and crop improvement.
