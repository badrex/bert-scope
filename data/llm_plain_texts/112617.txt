tldr: The authors investigate the relationship between rosaniline and rosolic acid, two related dyes, by conducting experiments with nitrous acid. They discover that one molecule of rosaniline consumes three equivalents of nitrous acid, and upon further analysis, they conclude that the resulting product is identical to rosolic acid. This research helps to better understand the chemical reactions and properties of these dyes.
