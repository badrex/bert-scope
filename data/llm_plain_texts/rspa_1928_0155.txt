revised_title: 'Decomposition and Reactions of Carbon Monoxide and Hydrogen in Electron Collision'
semantic_tags:
  - Chemical reaction
  - Carbon monoxide
  - Hydrogen
  - Electron collision
  - Formaldehyde synthesis
tldr: The authors studied the chemical reactions of carbon monoxide and hydrogen when activated by electron collision. They discovered that the main reaction can be represented by the equation 2CO → C + CO2. The authors also found that formaldehyde synthesis occurs when hydrogen molecules combine with carbon monoxide, which is different from the ammonia synthesis that requires a metal catalyst. This research helps to understand the behavior of molecules and atoms during electron collision and their subsequent reactions.
