tldr: The authors compared platinum thermometers and thermojunctions with the gas thermometer to determine their accuracy in high-temperature measurements. They found that the difference formula for the platinum thermometer can only represent a reality over a limited range, and that the gas thermometer is more accurate for high-temperature thermometry. This research improved the understanding of thermometry and its applications in various scientific fields.
