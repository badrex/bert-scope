tldr: The authors applied laser Doppler velocimetry to measure turbulence in non-isothermal flows and developed a method to estimate and correct the effect of laser beam interaction with turbulent temperature fluctuations. They tested this method in a fully developed stratified flow in an open channel, analyzing turbulence intensities and power spectral density functions. The results showed that the correction method effectively accounted for the beam interaction effect and provided accurate turbulence measurements.
