tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the continuity of protoplasm in vegetable cells. They discovered that protoplasmic threads connect adjacent cells, creating a continuity of protoplasm. This connection allows for the transfer of solid materials and communication of impulses between different parts of the plant. The authors also found that open pits do not occur, and the continuity of protoplasm is established by fine threads arranged in a sieve-like structure.
