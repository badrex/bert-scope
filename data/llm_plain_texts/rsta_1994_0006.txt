tldr: This article reviews the experiments and results of neutrino oscillation searches at high-energy accelerators. Two methods, disappearance and appearance, are discussed, along with their advantages and limitations. The article presents recent experimental results and exclusion plots, concluding that the mixing parameter limit should be further reduced to explore the possibility of neutrinos being dark matter candidates.
