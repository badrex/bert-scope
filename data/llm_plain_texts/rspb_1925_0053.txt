tldr: The authors studied the development of blood plasma in embryo chicks, focusing on the genesis of coagulable material. They discovered that the incoagulability of early chick embryos' blood is due to the absence of both fibrinogen and prothrombin. These substances develop simultaneously, and the appearance of globulin occurs later in development. The plasma of early embryos contains material that is protective against the inception of clotting, which is more thermostable than fibrinogen but does not possess antithrombic properties.
