tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the effect of tensile overstrain on iron's compression yield-point. They found that after recovery from overstrain, the compression yield-point is raised, contrary to the common belief that it is lowered. This discovery helps in understanding the behavior of iron and steel under different stress conditions.
