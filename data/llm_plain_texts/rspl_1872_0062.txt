tldr: This article describes experiments conducted at Glasgow University to determine the relationship between the electromagnetic and electrostatic units of measurement. The authors found that the ratio of these units is a velocity, which is also the velocity of light. This discovery is important for understanding the electromagnetic theory of light and the propagation of electromagnetic disturbances through a dielectric medium.
