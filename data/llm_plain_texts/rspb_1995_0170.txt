tldr: The author compared a mitochondrial gene and its corresponding nuclear pseudogene in eight sets of closely related birds. They found that mitochondrial genes accumulate substitutions much faster than nuclear pseudogenes, with mitochondrial third-position transitions being at least 39 times faster. This study warns against the unintended inclusion of paralogous sequences in phylogenetic analysis and the use of versatile primers that can promote such incidents.
