tldr: 'The author, Henry Miles, shares his observations and thermometer readings during a particularly harsh winter. He discusses the differences in temperature readings between his location and John Canton's, as well as the factors that may have influenced the cold weather, such as subterranean heat and warm air transpiring from the earth. Miles also notes the difference in temperature between his closed chamber and the outdoors.'
