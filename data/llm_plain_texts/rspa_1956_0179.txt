tldr: The authors studied the oxidation of acetaldehyde in glacial acetic acid, catalyzed by manganese, copper, and cobalt acetate. They found that the reaction proceeds in two stages: the oxidation of the aldehyde to peracetic acid and the reaction of peracetic acid with acetaldehyde to form a second peroxide. The metal-salt-catalyzed decomposition of both peroxides was determined. The results indicate that the initiating process is an electron-transfer reaction between the aldehyde and the higher valence state of the metal catalyst, leading to a chain process and a unified reaction scheme for the metal-salt-catalyzed oxidation of acetaldehyde.
