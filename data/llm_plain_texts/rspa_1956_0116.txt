tldr: The authors investigate the possibility of deriving hydromagnetic equations from the Boltzmann equation for a dilute gas with no interparticle collisions but a strong Lorentz force. They find that a strictly hydrodynamic description is possible only when certain conditions suppress the third moment of the velocity distribution. The electron degrees of freedom can be replaced by a macroscopic current, making the problem essentially one-fluid, focusing on ions.
