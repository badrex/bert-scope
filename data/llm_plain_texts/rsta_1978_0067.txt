tldr: This article presents a method for connecting Liouville-Green approximations in the complex plane, allowing for the construction of uniform asymptotic approximations for solutions of differential equations. The method can be applied to cases with multiple turning points of varying multiplicities, integral or fractional, and provides a more efficient way to connect approximations in the complex domain.
