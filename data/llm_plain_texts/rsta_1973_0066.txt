tldr: This article discusses the measurement and interpretation of changes in strain in rocks, focusing on patterns and magnitudes of natural strain in various tectonic environments. The author presents five different geological structures and their associated strain values, demonstrating the wide range of deformation modes and strain magnitudes. The study aims to provide insights into the origin and formation of major geological structures by understanding the processes and mechanisms of natural crustal deformation.
