  - Temperature
tldr: This article investigates the relationship between surface energy and temperature in various liquids. The authors find that a rectilinear relation exists for some liquids, while others exhibit molecular association. They also develop a method to determine the molecular complexity of undiluted liquids. The study includes ether, methyl formate, ethyl acetate, carbon tetrachloride, benzene, chlorobenzene, acetic acid, and methyl and ethyl alcohols.
