tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the reactions of nitric acid, binoxide of manganese, and sulphuric acid on various organic bases. They found that these chemicals can help determine the constitution of natural organic bases, such as aniline and diethylaniline, by replacing their radicals with hydrogen atoms. The author also mentioned ongoing experiments with narcotine to determine its constitution.
