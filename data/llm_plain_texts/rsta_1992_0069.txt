tldr: This article reviews conventional X-ray diffraction techniques used to study enzyme mechanisms, focusing on serine proteinases, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, and xylose isomerase. The author discusses the challenges and limitations of these techniques, as well as the potential of time-resolved methods to overcome them. The article highlights the importance of understanding enzyme-substrate interactions and conformational changes for better insights into enzyme mechanisms.
