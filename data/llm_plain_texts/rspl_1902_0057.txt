tldr: The author discovered a previously unnoticed patch of hyphae in the Darnel plant (Lolium temulentum, L.), which plays a role in the plant's infection process. The fungus forms a layer outside the aleurone of the grain and can be found in the growing point of the embryo. This symbiotic relationship between the fungus and the plant may be a result of a former spore-forming habit adapting to a new intra-seminal mode of infection. The author also discusses the potential benefits of this symbiosis for the Darnel plant, such as increased germination efficiency and larger grain size.
