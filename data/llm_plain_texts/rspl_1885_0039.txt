tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the vibration periods of drops and the effect of surface tension on the separation of maxima. They observed that the period of vibration increases with decreasing tension. The separation of maxima is greater in cases of paraffin, turpentine, and alcohol compared to water. The author also found that the separation is nearly twice as great for oleate of soda solution compared to pure water.
