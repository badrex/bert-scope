tldr: 'The authors used a mass spectrograph to study the energy released in certain nuclear transformations. They found that the energy released in the transformation of bombarded lithium by protons was -volts, and the range of the resulting particles was cm. The results showed that energy was conserved in the reaction, and further studies using a cloud-chamber could provide more information on the mechanism of these atomic explosions.'
