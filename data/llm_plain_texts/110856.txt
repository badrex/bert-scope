tldr: The author, W.F. Stevenson, argues that electricity is a single undecomposable fluid and that the distinction between positive and negative electricities is derived from the direction of its motion. He also suggests that magnetic fluid follows the same law as electric fluid, moving in a current with positive and negative poles depending on the direction of fluid flow.
