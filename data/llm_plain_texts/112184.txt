semantic_tags:
  - Crystallography

  - Optical properties
  - Index of refraction
tldr: The author studied the crystallographic and optical properties of various thallium compounds. They observed different crystal forms and combinations, and determined the indices of refraction for different rays and wavelengths. The crystals exhibited a symmetry compatible with either the prismatic or oblique system, and were often found in twinned formations.
