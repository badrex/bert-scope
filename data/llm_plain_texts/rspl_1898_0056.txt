tldr: The author conducted experiments using a specialized camera to study the active area on the anti-cathode of a focus tube, from which Röntgen rays proceed. They discovered that the efficiency of Röntgen ray production depends on the angle of the anti-cathode and the distance between the cathode and anti-cathode. The author also observed that a significant portion of Röntgen rays comes from the glass of the tube, which they suggest may be positively charged streams proceeding from the anti-cathode.
