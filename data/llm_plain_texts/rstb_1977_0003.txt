tldr: The author examines the organization and function of the basal lobes in the squid Loligo, focusing on the higher motor centres and their role in controlling movement. The basal lobes are compared to the vertebrate cerebellum and are found to have similarities in their structure and function. The study provides insights into the decision-making and motor activities in cephalopods, contributing to a better understanding of their nervous system.
