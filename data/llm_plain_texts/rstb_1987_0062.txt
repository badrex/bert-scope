tldr: 'This article discusses the current state and future prospects of nitrogen fixation research. It highlights the need for practical applications of theoretical understanding to improve crop production. The author explores various aspects of nitrogen fixation, including the manipulation of genes, acid tolerance in legume bacteria, and the role of dicarboxylates in nitrogen fixation. The article also touches upon alternative nitrogenases and the potential for chemical processes to rival the Haber process in large-scale nitrogenous fertilizer production. The author emphasizes the importance of addressing technology gaps in developing countries to fully utilize legumes and their nitrogen-fixing capabilities.'
