tldr: The article examines the deformation of slender filaments with planar crimp, focusing on the mechanics of aligned collagen fibers in mammalian tendons. The authors develop a theory of extensible planar elasticas and provide a numerical solution to explore the effects of crimp level, slenderness, and shape on load-extension curves. They discuss the limitations of the elastica theory and potential applications to textile materials.
