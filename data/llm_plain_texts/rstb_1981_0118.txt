tldr: The authors explore the possibility of reaction-diffusion mechanisms being responsible for the morphogenesis in unicellular algae, particularly in the group of freshwater green algae known as desmids. They analyze various patterns and compare them with the predictions of reaction-diffusion models, finding a good agreement in some cases. The study suggests that reaction-diffusion mechanisms may be involved in specifying cell wall ingrowths and cell wall outgrowths, as well as the plane of cell division.
