tldr: The authors conducted observations of atmospheric electricity over the ocean near the Equator and found that the emanation increases from higher latitudes towards the Equator. They also studied the effect of rain and wind on the ionization and provided explanations for their findings, including the role of air pressure and trade winds in the distribution of atmospheric electricity.
