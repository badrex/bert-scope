  - Luminosity
tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the coloration and electrical conductivity of flames containing vaporized alkali salts. They found that the coloration and conductivity were due to the presence of free ions in the flame, which were produced by the dissociation of the salt vapors. This study has implications for understanding the behavior of flames and the potential applications in spectroscopy and chemical analysis.
