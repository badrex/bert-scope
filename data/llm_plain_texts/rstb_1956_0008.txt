tldr: This study investigates the flight performance of the desert locust, focusing on how various wing-stroke parameters are related to the lift and thrust produced during steady-state flight. The locusts were suspended from a balance and flown against a uniform horizontal wind in a wind tunnel. The results show that the stroke frequency and lift are influenced by reflex control, while the stroke angles, stroke-plane angles, and wing positions remain relatively constant. The flight performance and stroke parameters are independent of changes in air temperature within a specific range, and the large variations in lift cannot be explained by changes in measured stroke parameters. The study provides a basis for further research on locust flight dynamics and energetics.
