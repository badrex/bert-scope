tldr: Researchers have discovered that protein residues within ostrich eggshells can be used to determine the age and temperature history of the eggshells, providing valuable information about the evolution of modern humans. By analyzing the extent of isoleucine epimerization and leucine hydrolysis in the eggshells, they were able to date levels at Border Cave, South Africa, where anatomically modern human remains were found. This technique offers a new way to study the evolution of humans and their environment.
