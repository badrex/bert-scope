tldr: The author proves that any cubic form in 32 variables with integral coefficients has a solution in integers, not all zero. The proof is based on the Hardy-Littlewood method, which involves dissecting a definite integral into parts and estimating an exponential sum containing a general cubic form. This result extends previous work on additive problems and provides a significant contribution to the understanding of cubic forms and Diophantine equations.
