tldr: This article studies wave transmission along fluid-loaded plane elastic membranes supported by finite arrays of equally spaced ribs. The author provides an exact solution for a general finite configuration and explains the observed features, such as pass and stop bands, and the response of the arrays in the pass bands. The solution reveals that the forces at each rib form an interference pattern, which can be thought of as propagating inwards from each end. The results have implications for aeronautical and marine engineering applications.
