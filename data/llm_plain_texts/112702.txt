tldr: The author studied the reaction of chlorine with propane and its derivatives. They discovered that the chief product of this reaction is trichlorhydrine, mixed with higher chlorinated products. The author also found that propane cannot replace more than six atoms of hydrogen with chlorine through direct substitution. This research contributes to the understanding of chemical reactions involving hydrocarbons.
