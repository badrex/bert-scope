tldr: 'The article discusses the clinical picture of auditory agnosia, a disorder where patients have difficulty recognizing non-verbal sounds and noises. It describes the two types of auditory agnosia: a semantic-associative one, associated with left hemisphere lesions and aphasia, and a discriminative one, associated with right hemisphere lesions. The author presents experimental studies on unselected brain-damaged patients to clarify the relationship between auditory agnosia and aphasia, and the hemispheric side of the lesion. The results indicate that the two types of auditory agnosia have different underlying causes and are related to different brain functions.'
