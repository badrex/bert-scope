tldr: The authors present an exact formula for calculating the dipole moment of a one-electron diatomic molecule using the Hellmann-Feynman theorem and a new recursion relation. This formula helps to investigate the behavior of the dipole moment in the vicinity of the united atom and when the nuclei are far apart. The formula is particularly useful for examining the dipole moment's analytical properties and can be applied to various expectation values.
