tldr: The study investigates the distribution and termination of degenerating fibres in the lumbosacral spinal cord of the cat after cutting dorsal roots. The research focuses on the correlation between the spatial distribution of direct inhibition and terminals on motor dendrites, suggesting that at least part of the inhibition is monosynaptically and dendritically mediated. The findings provide insights into the anatomical organization of the vertebrate central nervous system and the processes of facilitation and inhibition.
