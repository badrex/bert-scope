tldr: The authors analyze the changes in Arctic sea ice extent and thickness, examining the impact of climate change on the region. They discuss the importance of sea ice extent in global change and review the methods of measurement, including satellite observations. The study finds a small but significant reduction in Arctic ice extent during 1978-87, with regional variations and trends. The authors also explore the link between ice conditions and changes in the Greenland Sea, as well as the mechanisms by which the extent and thickness of pack ice may respond to climate change.
