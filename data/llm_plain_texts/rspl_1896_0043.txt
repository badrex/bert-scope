tldr: The authors conducted experiments on animals to investigate how movements are represented in the lumbar region of the mammalian spinal cord. They discovered that movements are mainly represented in the postero-external column of the spinal cord and that the excitability of the spinal cord and nerve roots increases with repeated stimulation of the posterior roots. This research provides insights into the understanding of motor control and the nervous system.
