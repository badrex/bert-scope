tldr: The authors discovered a new radiationless process of negative ion formation in mercury vapour. They found that negative ions are produced when electrons capture two electrons from electrodes, which has a high probability of occurrence. This process is different from the previously believed processes of negative ion formation, and it may require a modification of the interpretation of previous work on negative ions.
