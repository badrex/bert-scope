tldr: The author analyzes the Madreporaria species collected during the 'Porcupine' expedition and compares them to species from other regions and time periods. They discover that many species are actually variations of one another and that some previously considered distinct species are now absorbed into a broader classification. The author also discusses the great variability of coral species and their adaptations to different environments.
