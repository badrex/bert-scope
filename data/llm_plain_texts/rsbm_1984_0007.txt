tldr: 'Eugen Glueckauf was a German chemist who made significant contributions to the fields of surface chemistry, adsorption, and surface reactions. He developed a method for the quantitative separation of helium and neon, and his work on the Szilard-Chalmers reaction led to the development of "hot-atom" chemistry. Glueckauf also conducted research on the water vapor content in the stratosphere, which was later confirmed by other scientists.'
