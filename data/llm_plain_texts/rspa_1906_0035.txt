tldr: This article presents experiments on the explosions of coal-gas and air mixtures, focusing on the combustion process, pressure, and temperature changes. The authors found that the combustion is nearly complete at the time of maximum pressure, and the temperature distribution is mainly determined by the initial conditions of the gas. They also observed differences in the behavior of weak and strong mixtures, with the weak mixtures experiencing slower flame propagation and greater heat loss.
