tldr: This article presents a comprehensive study of x-ray crystallography applied to the chemistry of steroids. The authors analyze over 80 sterol derivatives, focusing on the cholesterol and ergosterol series, and provide detailed crystallographic data, including unit cell size, space group, and crystal morphology. The study helps identify individual sterol derivatives, determine molecular weights, and explore the stereochemistry of the carbon skeleton. The authors also discuss the crystal structures of calciferol and other sterols, and suggest further research directions in the field.
