tldr: The article recounts the life and scientific contributions of Joachim Hämmerling, a pioneer in the field of cell biology. Hämmerling conducted groundbreaking experiments on Acetabularia, a marine alga, which led to significant discoveries about nucleo-cytoplasmic relationships, nuclear transplantation, and morphogenesis. His work challenged prevailing theories of gene action and morphogenesis, and influenced the development of his own personality and scientific community's understanding of the field.
