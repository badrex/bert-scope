tldr: The authors correct a previous account of A. A. Campbell Swinton's contributions to television, revealing that his experiments with cathode ray tubes as both picture transmitter and receiver took place in 1903, twenty years earlier than previously thought. This discovery enhances the significance of Campbell Swinton's role in the invention of television.
