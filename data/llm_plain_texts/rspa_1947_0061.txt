tldr: The authors present a theory for the escape of molecules from a plane surface into a still atmosphere, focusing on liquids evaporating from plane surfaces. They develop a method to determine the coefficients of diffusion and accommodation, which can be used to study the rate of vaporization and the properties of the escaping molecules. The authors provide experimental data for two liquids, furfural and methyl salicylate, and discuss the temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient.
