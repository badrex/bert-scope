tldr: This article investigates the probability of inelastic electron scattering in helium, neon, and argon gases. The authors use a photographic method to study the effects of electron collisions and compare the probabilities of different excitations in each gas. The results show that the probability of excitation increases with the energy of the colliding electron, and the authors find good agreement with theoretical calculations for helium.
