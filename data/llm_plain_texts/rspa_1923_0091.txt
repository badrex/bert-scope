revised_title: The Latent Period and Mixtures of Two Lubricants in Boundary Lubrication
semantic_tags:
  - Lubrication
  - Boundary lubrication
  - Latent period
  - Lubricant mixtures
  - Surface orientation
tldr: This article investigates the latent period in boundary lubrication, which is the time it takes for a lubricant's molecules to orient themselves at a solid surface. The author explores the effects of temperature, mechanical agitation, and mixtures of lubricants on the latent period and its importance in practical lubrication.
