tldr: The authors studied the mechanism of NADP-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase in heart mitochondria using transient-state kinetics. They found that a step preceding the release of NADPH is rate-limiting in the oxidative decarboxylation reaction. The results provide insights into the enzyme's conformational changes and help understand the reaction mechanism.
