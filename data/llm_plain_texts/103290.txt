tldr: A case study is presented of a child who cried in the womb for five weeks before birth. The child's crying was heard and felt by the mother and midwife, and it was observed that the child settled on the mother's left side. This case study provides insight into fetal development and the potential impact of fetal movements on the mother's experience during pregnancy.
