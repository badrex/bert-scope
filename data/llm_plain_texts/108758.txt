tldr: The authors investigated the properties and constituents of the resin obtained from Ficus Rubiginosa, discovering a new natural acetic ether and a neutral resin they named Sycoretin. They analyzed the physical and chemical characteristics of the resin and its constituents, including solubility, color, and reaction with various substances. The authors found that Sycoretin is a neutral resin with unique properties, and it cannot be classified with glucosides or other organic compounds.
