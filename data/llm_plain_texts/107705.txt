tldr: The author, William Prout, conducted experiments to determine the nature of the acid and saline matters in animal stomachs. He discovered that the acid in question is muriatic acid, and the salts found in the stomach are alkaline muriates. This finding is important for understanding the physiology and pathology of the digestive process and other animal functions.
