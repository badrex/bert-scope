tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the chemical electron emission and reactions of liquid NaK with various gaseous compounds, including ClCN, HgBr2, (OH)2, O3, and other gases. They observed small negative emissions in some reactions and analyzed the electron energy spectra to understand the reaction mechanisms and the role of halogen atoms in the process. The results provide insights into the electron emission and the dissociation of gas molecules during chemical reactions.
