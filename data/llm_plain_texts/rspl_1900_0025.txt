tldr: The authors, Hele-Shaw and Hay, investigate the similarities between the flow of a viscous liquid in a thin layer and the lines of magnetic induction in a magnetic field. They develop a method to determine the lines of induction in a solid magnetic body and apply it to various two-dimensional problems in magnetic induction, electrical flow, and heat conduction.
