tldr: The authors used a defined electron beam to re-determine the excitation potential of the nitrogen Second Positive bands. They found a more accurate and reliable method to measure the intensities and corrected for pressure variations, providing a better understanding of the nitrogen molecular energy diagram and the theory of active nitrogen.
