tldr: The author, S.M. Drach, presents a method to empirically resolve hourly observations and their relation to the sun's motion. By using this method, the author calculates the diurnal variation of magnetic declination for various locations and infers that six-hourly temperature intervals can provide the mean temperature of the day. This method can be applied to map oceanic temperatures and test theoretical formulas.
