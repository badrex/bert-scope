follows from (1.5) that the rebound function is constant. The photon's motion is therefore governed by (3.3) and (3.8) or (3.9) or (3.10) and (3.11) according as the expansion is hyperbolic, parabolic or elliptic. The wavelength of the photon is given by (1.7) and the corresponding frequency by (1.5). Wien's displacement law follows from (3.9) and (1.7) when the expansion is parabolic. The photon's energy is (1.7) and its angular momentum is (1.2). The energy and angular momentum are conserved during the repeated reflexions. The photon's motion is also governed by the relativistic equations (1.4) and (1.5). The relativistic treatment of the photon's motion is more complicated than the classical treatment, but the results are similar. The photon's energy and angular momentum are still conserved during the repeated reflexions. The relativistic treatment also predicts that the photon's mass is zero, which is consistent with the photon being a massless particle.

MONATOMIC GAS AND THERMODYNAMICS The motion of a monatomic gas in an expanding sphere can be described by the same equations as the motion of a photon, with the exception of the energy equation. The energy of a gas particle is given by (1.7), where is the mass of the particle and is the wavelength of the particle. The energy of the gas is given by the sum of the energies of all the particles in the gas. The energy of the gas is conserved during the repeated reflexions. The gas can be treated as a thermodynamic system, and the thermodynamic properties of the gas can be calculated using the equations of state for an ideal gas. The equations of state for an ideal gas are given by the following relations: PV = RT, where P is the pressure, V is the volume, T is the temperature, and R is the gas constant;
