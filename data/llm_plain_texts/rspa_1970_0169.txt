tldr: This article discusses the challenges of improving mechanical properties in fibrous composites, specifically addressing the conflict between strong fiber-matrix bonds for interlaminar strength and weak bonds for toughness. The author proposes a solution using duplex fibers with strong outer interfaces and weak internal interfaces to maximize composite performance in various failure modes.
