tldr: This study examines the larval musculature development of the barnacle Ibla quadrivalvis, focusing on its six naupliar stages and the transition to the cyprid stage. The research reveals that despite lecithotrophic development, I. quadrivalvis retains a relatively generalized arrangement of naupliar and cypris muscles and a generalized transition from one to the other. The findings provide a comparison with the more extreme histolysis and replacement of the musculature in Semibalanus balanoides and contribute to the understanding of muscle metamorphosis in thoracican barnacles.
