tldr: This article presents the results of experiments on the chemical and bacteriological examination of sewage microorganisms. The authors isolated various organisms from crude sewage and studied their reactions from a chemical and bacteriological point of view. They determined the absorptive power for free oxygen and the growth of these organisms in liquid media with and without oxygen. The authors also discussed methods for isolating microorganisms, including anaerobic and spore-forming organisms, and the role of these organisms in the processes of sewage purification and putrefaction.
