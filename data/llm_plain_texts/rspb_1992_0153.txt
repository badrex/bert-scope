tldr: 'This study investigates how costs, such as time and energy, influence female sticklebacks' mate choice in sequential situations. The results show that as costs increase, female sticklebacks reduce their selectivity for preferred males. This demonstrates that females make economic decisions based on the costs of sampling and choosing, which affects the strength of sexual selection by female choice in the population.'
