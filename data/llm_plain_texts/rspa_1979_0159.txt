tldr: This article investigates the photophysics of the lowest triplet state in 2-benzoylpyridine crystals using optically detected magnetic resonance at zero and high fields. The researchers discovered seven transitions in the crystals and determined the orientations of the fine-structure tensors of the magnetic species. They also studied the effects of doping the crystals with various chemical impurities and analyzed the angles between the unit cell axes and the fine-structure axes.
