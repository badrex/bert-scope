tldr: The author presents a method for mechanically integrating linear differential equations of the second order with variable coefficients. The method involves using a double machine with two integrators, where the motion of the center of the first integrator's globe is connected to the surface of the second integrator's cylinder. By moving the disks through specific angles, the machine can produce solutions to the given differential equation.
