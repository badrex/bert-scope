tldr: The article discusses the role of molecular chaperones in protein folding within the cell. It compares the folding process in vitro and in vivo, highlighting the differences in kinetics and the involvement of accessory proteins. The author also explains the role of protein disulphide isomerase in catalyzing the disulphide exchange reaction and the importance of molecular chaperones in preventing misfolding and aggregation of proteins.
