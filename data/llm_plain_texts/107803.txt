tldr: In 1825, J.F.W. Herschel and his team conducted a series of observations to determine the difference in longitude between the Royal Observatories of Greenwich and Paris. They used a combination of signals, telescopes, and chronometers to establish a connection between the two observatories, aiming to avoid misunderstandings and delays in communication. The observations were challenging due to various factors, but the team managed to gather valuable data for further analysis.
