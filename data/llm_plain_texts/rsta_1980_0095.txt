tldr: The author examines the effect of solute adsorption on grain boundary energy and its impact on decohesion. They consider various scenarios, including reversible and irreversible cases, and discuss how solute adsorption can either increase or decrease the likelihood of grain boundary separation. The study provides a more comprehensive understanding of the role of solute adsorption in materials properties and their potential applications.
