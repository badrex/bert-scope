tldr: This article presents a modeling exercise to understand the pattern of calcium carbonate preservation in the ocean. The authors compare their model's predictions with observations in three locations in the ocean, considering factors such as accumulation rates of calcium carbonate above the saturation horizon, the difference in carbonate ion saturation at the calcite lysocline and the carbonate compensation depth, and the difference in alkalinity between the water column saturation horizon and the calcite lysocline. The study aims to improve our understanding of the mechanisms controlling calcium carbonate preservation in the ocean.
