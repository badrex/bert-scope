tldr: The author examines the spectrum of the corona during solar eclipses and distinguishes between chromospheric and coronal phenomena. They identify three types of coronal rings and suggest that different substances are responsible for each type. The study also indicates that the green line in the coronal spectrum may not be produced in the outer corona.
