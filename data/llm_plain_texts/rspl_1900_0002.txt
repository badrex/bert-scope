tldr: The author conducted a comparative crystallographical study of double selenates of the series R2M(SeO4)2,6H2O, focusing on the salts where M is zinc. They analyzed the crystal structures, optical properties, and refractive indices of the selenates, providing insights into their physical and chemical properties.
