tldr: This article discusses the effects of hormones on the development of sexual behavior in animals. Researchers found that early exposure to androgens can influence the development of masculine and feminine behaviors in both males and females. The study demonstrates that separate neural mechanisms exist for masculine and feminine behaviors, and hormones play a crucial role in activating these mechanisms in adulthood.
