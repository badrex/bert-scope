revised_title: 'Inconsistencies in Scoring the Scarlet Tiger Moth's Heterozygote'
semantic_tags:

  - Moth behavior
  - Gene frequency
  - Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
tldr: The authors examine inconsistencies in the scoring of the heterozygote in the scarlet tiger moth, Panaxia dominula, and discuss the potential impact on understanding natural selection. They suggest that variations in scoring by different observers may have contributed to fluctuations in gene frequencies observed in the moth's colonies.
