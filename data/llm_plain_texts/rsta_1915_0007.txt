tldr: This article investigates the thermomagnetic properties of carbon steels, focusing on the eutectoid transition point where steel changes from a homogeneous material to a heterogeneous mixture of iron and carbide. The study finds that the eutectoid transition occurs at a specific temperature, and the loss of magnetism in the steel begins at this temperature. The results provide insights into the equilibrium diagram of steel and its phase transitions.
