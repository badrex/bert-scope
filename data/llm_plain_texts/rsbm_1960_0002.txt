tldr: 'William Ringrose Gelston Atkins was a versatile scientific worker who made significant contributions to chemistry, physics, and botany. He worked on freezing points and osmotic pressure of biological fluids, chemical dynamics, and fractional distillation of binary and ternary mixtures of liquids. During World War I, he worked on problems related to aeroplane fuels and varnishes. Atkins also collaborated with H. H. Dixon on plant physiology and authored a book on the subject. After the war, he worked on hydrogen ion concentration of soils, waters, and vegetable fluids and their effects on plant growth. He later became the Head of the Department of General Physiology in the Marine Biological Association's Laboratory at Plymouth, where he studied marine conditions favorable to plant life and growth.'
