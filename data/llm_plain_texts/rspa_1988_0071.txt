tldr: The author investigates the degree of ambiguity in a pair of images of a surface and the maximum number of interpretations that can be entertained. They show that if the images are ambiguous, all interpretations will locate the visible elements on a special type of quadric surface, and in that case, the pair of images cannot sustain more than three distinct and physically acceptable interpretations.
