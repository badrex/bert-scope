tldr: The authors analyze the structure of highly nonlinear vortices in curved channel flow, extending the understanding of Gortler vortices. They consider the flow in a curved channel, which is analogous to boundary layer flow, and study the behavior of small wavelength, highly nonlinear Gortler vortices. The main feature of their results is the development of a weak vortex on the boundary layer lengthscale, with implications for laminar flow wings and turbomachinery.
