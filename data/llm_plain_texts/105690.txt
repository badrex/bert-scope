tldr: The author, using Mr. Short's observations of the Sun's horizontal parallax, calculates the mean distance between the Earth and the Sun. The distance is determined to be approximately 94,380,685 miles, with the note that the actual distance may vary due to the elliptical shape of Earth's orbit. This research helps to better understand the scale of our solar system.
