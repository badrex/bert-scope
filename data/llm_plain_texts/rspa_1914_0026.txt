tldr: The authors investigate the form of a pulse that represents natural radiation from a gas, aiming to derive a pulse in agreement with Planck's law of radiation at any temperature. They find that the energy associated with any range of wavelengths depends only on the temperature and the form of the initial disturbance. The authors also decompose the pulse into simpler constituents, providing insights into the kinetic theory of gases.
