tldr: The author examines the natural history, distribution, and relative abundance of unstalked crinoids on the Antarctic continental shelf. They form a distinctive geographical assemblage that has likely evolved in isolation since the beginning of the Pleistocene or Quaternary Period. The author also discusses the trawling and dredging techniques used to collect these specimens and emphasizes the need for further sampling and taxonomic study to better understand their distribution and evolution.
