tldr: The author examines the role of ganglions in the nervous system, specifically focusing on their function in relation to involuntary movements. They argue that ganglions play a crucial role in the uniform involuntary movements of organs such as the heart and intestines, and suggest that their structure is analogous to that of the brain. This theory is supported by the fact that ganglions are not found on sensory nerves, which are responsible for transmitting perceptions and commands to the brain.
