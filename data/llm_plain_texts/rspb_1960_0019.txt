tldr: The author examines the structure and function of statocysts in Octopus vulgaris, revealing a complex set of receptors that help the octopus maintain balance and orientation. The statocyst contains a macula with a statolith and a crista statica with three sections, as well as hair cells and multipolar cells. These structures work together to provide the octopus with information about its environment and help it navigate effectively.
