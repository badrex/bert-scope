tldr: The authors conducted experiments to improve the sensitivity and accuracy of the quadrant electrometer, a device used to measure electrical potential differences. They discovered that the anomalous behavior of the electrometer was not caused by increased tension of the fibers, and they proposed a new method to measure power given by an alternating or intermittent current. The authors also provided detailed instructions for adjusting and maintaining the electrometer.
