tldr: The authors studied the metabolism of haemoglobin and haematin compounds in the parasitic nematode Ascaris lumbricoides. They found that the worms synthesize these compounds and discovered their distribution within the body. The results suggest that the variation in concentration of haemoglobin and haematin compounds is a mechanism to store them when they are in excess in the worm's gut, enabling a higher rate of egg-laying.
