tldr: This study investigates the reaction of alkyl radicals, specifically ethyl radicals, with molybdenum trioxide. The authors found that the formation of ethyl alcohol and diethyl ether depends on the surface separation and the concentration of hydrogen atoms on the oxide surface. The reaction rate is determined by the surface concentration of ethyl radicals, and the alcohol/ether ratio depends on the surface separation.
