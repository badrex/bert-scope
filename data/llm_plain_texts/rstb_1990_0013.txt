tldr: This article discusses the changes in DNA methylation patterns during mouse embryonic development and their relation to X-chromosome activity and imprinting. The author reviews the current data on methylation patterns in gametes, early embryos, embryonic and extra-embryonic cell lineages, and the germ line. The implications of changing DNA methylation in development are considered in terms of X-chromosome activity in female development and the processes of initiation, propagation, and erasure of imprinting.
