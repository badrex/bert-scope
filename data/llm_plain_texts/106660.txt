tldr: The author, Henry Cavendish, conducted experiments to convert a mixture of dephlogisticated and phlogisticated air into nitrous acid using an electric spark. He found that the mixture was indeed converted into nitrous acid, but the experiment needed to be continued for a longer time than his previous experiments. The results showed that the air mixtures were absorbed by soap-lees, and the acid produced was of the nitrous kind. This experiment demonstrated the importance of controlling the proportions of air mixtures and the duration of the experiment for accurate results.
