tldr: This article discusses the methods for analyzing deformed rocks and their textures, focusing on the use of texture goniometry. The authors describe the process of measuring finite strain states and phyllosilicate textures in slates, and they explain the limitations and advantages of reflexion and transmission modes in texture goniometry. They also present a combination of data collection methods to obtain a complete understanding of the geological structures.
