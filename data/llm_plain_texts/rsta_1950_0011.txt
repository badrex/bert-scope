tldr: The authors analyze the diffraction effects of radio waves reflected from an irregular ionosphere and the resulting fading. They develop a method to study the statistical properties of the wave-field using the concept of auto-correlation functions. The study has applications to optical problems of diffraction from irregular screens and can help understand the behavior of the ionosphere.
