revised_title: 'Spontaneous Luminosity of Uranium Minerals: Autunite and Radioactivity'

tldr: The author investigates the spontaneous luminosity of uranium minerals, particularly autunite, and attributes it to the mineral's radioactivity. The luminosity is independent of previous exposure to light and can be observed in a dark room. Autunite is more luminous than uranium nitrate but less so than potassium uranyl sulfate. The loss of luminosity is connected to the loss of water of crystallization.
