tldr: The authors discovered that V-acetyl galactosamine (GalNAc) plays a role in the interaction of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) insecticidal proteins with insect gut receptors. They found that GalNAc specifically decreased the cytolytic activity of a CrylA(c) toxin towards Choristoneura fumiferana CF1 cells and completely abolished toxin binding to Manduca sexta brush-border membrane vesicles. This suggests that GalNAc might be a component of a CrylA(c) toxin receptor in the insect gut.
