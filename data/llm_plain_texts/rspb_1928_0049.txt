tldr: The author investigates the behavior of wool fibers when extended in water and the factors affecting their elasticity and plasticity. They find that wool fibers experience no permanent alteration below 34% extension, and beyond this point, the degree of elastic imperfection increases with the extension attained. The study also reveals that wool fibers consist of an elastic continuous cellular framework enclosing a fibrillar structure arranged along the fiber's axis.
