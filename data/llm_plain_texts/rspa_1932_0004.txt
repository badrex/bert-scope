tldr: This article investigates the sorption of carbon bisulphide at low pressures by activated charcoals. The authors measure the isosteres and isothermals for various charcoals and find that the heat of adsorption varies depending on the type and activation method of the charcoal. They also discover that some charcoals exhibit "breaks" in their isosteres, which they attribute to the surface state of the activated charcoals.
