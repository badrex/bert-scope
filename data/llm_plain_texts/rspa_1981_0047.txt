revised_title: 'Pulse Transmission in Nerve Fibers: A Ray Method Approach'
semantic_tags:
  - Wave mechanics
  - Nerve pulse propagation
  - Ray method
  - Hyperbolic equations
  - Hodgkin-Huxley model
tldr: The author uses the ray method to analyze pulse propagation in nerve fibers, resulting in a hyperbolic system of equations that avoids the paradox of infinite velocity found in the Hodgkin-Huxley model. The study provides a more accurate description of nerve pulse transmission and offers insights into the underlying wave mechanics.
