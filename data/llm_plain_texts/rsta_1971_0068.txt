tldr: This article discusses new findings in solar studies, specifically focusing on X-ray flare polarization and regional structure. The authors discovered polarization in X-ray emission during the rising phase of three X-ray flares, indicating the presence of directed electron beams. They also found that X-ray flare regions have a filamentary structure with bright knots and rapid spatial alterations. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms behind solar flares and their effects on the Sun's magnetic fields.
