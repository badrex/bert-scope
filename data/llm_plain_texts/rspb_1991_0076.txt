tldr: The study investigates how afferent signals from pigeon extraocular muscles modify the responses of units in the abducens nucleus to horizontal vestibular stimulation. The results show that extraocular muscle afferents influence vestibularly driven activity in the abducens nucleus, providing evidence that extraocular afferent signals play a role in the control of eye movement.
