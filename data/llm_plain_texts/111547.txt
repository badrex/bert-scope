tldr: The author, P. Griess, discovered new nitrogenous compounds by reacting nitrous acid with various phenyl and benzoyl substances. He found that diazodinitrophenol and diazonitrophenol have unique properties and can be synthesized through different chemical reactions. These compounds are valuable for their potential applications in the study of nitrogenous substances and the phenol group.
