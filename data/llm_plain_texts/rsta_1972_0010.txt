tldr: This article discusses the silica saturation in Cenozoic basalt and its implications for understanding volcanism and the Earth's structure. The author analyzes a large dataset of published rock analyses and finds that Cenozoic basalts are either oversaturated or undersaturated with respect to silica. The author also addresses the challenges of assigning weights to the analyzed data and the importance of considering geological factors in the analysis. The study concludes that alkaline basalts are as abundant as subalkaline ones in the Cenozoic era.
