tldr: 'The author conducted experiments to understand the effect of long grinding on quartz (silver sand). They found that grinding causes a significant portion of the crystalline material to be converted into the vitreous state. The density of the ground material is lower than the unground material, indicating that 25.7% of the material is converted from the crystalline to the vitreous condition. This result is consistent with the findings from molecular heat of solution determinations.'
