tldr: This article describes the observations of the transit of Venus over the Sun's disk made by a committee of astronomers in Norriton, Pennsylvania, in 1769. The observations were conducted to improve the accuracy of timepieces and to determine the latitude and longitude of the observation site. The team used various telescopes and instruments, including a 21/2 feet Gregorian reflector and a 36 feet refractor, to make precise measurements of the celestial event.
