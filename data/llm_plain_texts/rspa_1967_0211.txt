semantic_tags:
  - Fluid dynamics
  - Heat transfer
  - Natural convection
  - Thermal engineering
  - Nuclear engineering
tldr: The article predicts heat transfer due to natural convection in vertically cooled cylinders containing heat-generating fluids. It focuses on fluids with Prandtl numbers of unity or above and provides solutions for infinite and semi-infinite cells with closed lower ends. The study is relevant to nuclear engineering, chemical engineering, and geophysics.
