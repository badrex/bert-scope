tldr: 'The study investigates the survival of Bacterium lactis aerogenes when held at growth temperature without nutriment. It found that maximum survival occurs at a specific cell density, with survival being proportionally less at higher and lower densities. The findings suggest that bacterial cells can interact and support each other's survival in nutrient-deprived conditions.'
