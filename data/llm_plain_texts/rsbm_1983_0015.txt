tldr: The article is a biography of Kurt Alfred Georg Mendelssohn, a prominent physicist who made significant contributions to low-temperature physics and cryogenics. Born into a family with a strong intellectual tradition, Mendelssohn was encouraged by his father to explore science from a young age. He attended the University of Berlin and began his research under the supervision of his cousin Franz Simon, who was known for his work in low-temperature physics. Mendelssohn's research focused on the specific heat of solid hydrogen at extremely low temperatures, which provided new insights into the behavior of matter at these temperatures. He later moved to Breslau with Simon and continued his research, making important contributions to the field of low-temperature physics.
