tldr: The authors analyze the nonlinear stability of stationary solutions for incompressible inviscid stratified fluid flow in two and three dimensions using the Euler equations and their Boussinesq approximations. They employ energy methods, conserved quantities, and convexity estimates to derive nonlinear stability criteria, which differ from linearized Vol. 318 stability criteria. The study covers specific examples and Hamiltonian structures for the problems, providing a deeper understanding of fluid dynamics and stability.
