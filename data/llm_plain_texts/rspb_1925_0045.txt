tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of sub-sterility X-ray exposure on fertility and sex-ratio in mice. They found that exposing male mice to a sub-sterility dose of X-rays resulted in abnormal sperm production and a higher number of female offspring. The study suggests that X-ray exposure may affect the fertilizing powers of sperm without causing complete sterility.
