tldr: 'Thomas Andrews conducted experiments on the heat evolved during the reaction of acids and bases. He found that the change in temperature is determined by the nature of the base, not the acid. Andrews also discussed the influence of various factors on the results of such experiments and proposed a general law for basic substitutions.'
