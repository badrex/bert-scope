tldr: The authors developed a simple and cost-effective method to estimate the intensity distribution of X-ray spectra using a carbon print and a -ray electroscope. This method integrates the -ray intensity of a crystal reflection, which can be useful for accurate -ray analysis. The authors tested the method on mica and copper samples, obtaining satisfactory results that agree with previous findings.
