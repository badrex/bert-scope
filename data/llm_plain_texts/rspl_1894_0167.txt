tldr: This study investigates the impact of various environmental factors, such as temperature, light spectrum, water salinity, and darkness, on the growth and development of sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus lividus) larvae. The research found that factors like temperature, light, and water salinity significantly affect the size and development of the larvae, with some factors causing growth inhibition or stimulation. The findings contribute to the understanding of how environmental conditions can influence the development of echinoderm larvae.
