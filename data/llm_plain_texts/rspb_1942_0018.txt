tldr: The study investigates the integument and moult cycle of the spider Tegenaria atrica. It discovers that the spider's integument consists of two chitinous layers, the outer exocuticula and the inner endocuticula. The exocuticula is formed before the moult, while the endocuticula is formed after. The substances impregnating the exocuticula are brought to it by granular blood cells. The study also examines the role of blood cells, the digestive diverticula, and the possible origin of a moulting hormone in the moult cycle.
