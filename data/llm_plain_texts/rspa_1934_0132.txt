tldr: This article explores the effect of thermal conditions on the atomic arrangement in alloys, focusing on the dynamic equilibrium between the orderly arrangement of metal atoms and the random distribution caused by thermal agitation. The authors discuss the relationship between the degree of order, temperature, and the potential energy involved in atomic interchanges within a single phase system.
