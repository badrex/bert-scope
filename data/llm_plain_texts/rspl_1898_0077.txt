tldr: The authors investigated the formation, storage, and depletion of carbohydrates in monocotyledon plants, focusing on starch and inulin. They found that starch formation varies among different species and is influenced by factors such as leaf type, position, and environmental conditions. Starch in stomatal guard cells is also examined, and the authors discovered that inulin is not uncommon in monocotyledons. They also found that starch and inulin can coexist in the same cell.
