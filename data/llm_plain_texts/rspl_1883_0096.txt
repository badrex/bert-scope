tldr: This paper by J. H. Poynting and Lord Rayleigh investigates the transfer of energy in electromagnetic fields. They propose a general law for energy transfer, stating that it moves perpendicularly to the plane containing electric and magnetic forces. The authors also apply this law to various current-bearing circuits and discuss energy movement in their vicinity.
