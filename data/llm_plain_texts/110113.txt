tldr: The author, John Davy, studied the poison found in the common toad and discovered that it is mainly located in the skin's follicles. The poison is a thick, yellowish fluid with acrid properties. Although it is toxic, it is not noxious when absorbed into the bloodstream. Davy suggests that the primary purpose of the poison is to protect the toad from predators. Additionally, he found that the toad's respiratory system has a unique structure that may help expel carbon from the blood and aid in the function of the lungs. Despite attempts, Davy could not find a direct connection between the skin and the respiratory system for gas exchange.
