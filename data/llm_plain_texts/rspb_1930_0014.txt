tldr: The authors studied the respiratory activity of apples at different temperatures to understand how it changes during senescence. They found that the progress of senescence is characterized by a rise and fall of respiratory activity, and the time taken to reach the peak value varies inversely with temperature. The study provides insights into the effects of temperature on plant metabolism and fruit storage.
