tldr: This article discusses the fossil evidence of plant and arthropod interactions in the Palaeozoic and Mesozoic eras. It explores the early relationships between land-adapted arthropods and plants, and how these interactions contributed to the development of terrestrial ecosystems. The authors also examine the role of plant-animal relationships in the context of biotic pollination and other aspects of angiosperm-insect interactions.
