tldr: The author constructs a spatial Hamiltonian evolution equation for relative equilibria in the water-wave problem with surface tension. The energy and momentum fluxes play a crucial role in the spatial Hamiltonian structure, and the author uses this structure to show the existence of dual variational principles for traveling waves and analyze a singularity in the dispersion relation for capillary-gravity waves.
