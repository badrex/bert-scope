tldr: This article discusses the modifications required in the quantitative spectrographic analysis of biological materials, specifically plant tissue. The authors describe a technique that uses a small copper mortar to crush and disintegrate the sample, followed by the addition of a binding material to create a thin, compact layer on a plane electrode. The method also involves using an internal standard and a high potential D.C. source. The authors conclude that the error in a single determination is not more than 10% and discuss potential errors that may be introduced by deviations from standard conditions.
