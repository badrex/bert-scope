tldr: The authors present a method to determine the lengthening of the HF bond in hydrogen-bonded dimers for the first time. They use ground-state hyperfine coupling constants and nuclear quadrupole coupling constants from the rotational spectra of the molecules to establish the values for a series of heterodimers. The results show that the bond lengthening is a monotonically increasing function of the hydrogen-bond stretching force constant, which serves as a measure of the hydrogen bond strength.
