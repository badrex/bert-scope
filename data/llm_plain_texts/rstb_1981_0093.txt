revised_title: 'The Role of Trace Elements and Oxidative Stress in Biological Systems'
semantic_tags:
  - Oxidative stress
  - Trace element deficiency
  - Superoxide dismutase
  - Oxygen metabolism
  - Antioxidant defense
tldr: This article discusses the metabolic and physiological consequences of trace element deficiency in animals and humans, focusing on the roles of oxygen, oxidases, and essential trace metals. The author explains the chemistry of oxygen reduction products and their potential hazards to the organism. Defenses against these hazardous species, such as dismutases, catalase, and selenium-dependent peroxidase, are examined. The article also explores the employment of oxygen reduction products during phagocytosis and the importance of antioxidant defense mechanisms in maintaining cellular health.
