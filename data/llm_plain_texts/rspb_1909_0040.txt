tldr: 'The authors discovered a giant sulphur bacterium called Hillhousia mirabilis, which is found in stagnant pools and marshy bogs. The cells are large, containing globules of oily amorphous sulphur. They are motile and have cilia on their exterior, which aid in their movement. The bacterium's cell structure is unique, with a highly resistant cell wall and no definite nucleus. The sulphur globules can be dissolved by various reagents and are thought to be in a loose combination with proteid material.'
