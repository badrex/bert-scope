revised_title: The Invariance of Spin in General Relativity

  - Supertranslation Invariance
tldr: The author demonstrates that the spin vectors of an isolated system in general relativity are supertranslation invariant, making them independent of the choice of Minkowski observation space. This finding applies to transitions between stationary states and resolves a previous misconception about the sensitivity of spin to the choice of null hypersurface.
