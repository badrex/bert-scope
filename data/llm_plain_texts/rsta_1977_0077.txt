tldr: This article examines the distribution and flux of micrometeoroids on the Moon using data from Apollo 17 rocks and recent recalibrations of solar flare track production rates. The authors estimate an influx of approximately 300 particles corresponding to a crater diameter of 0.1. They also find no anisotropy in the distribution of submicron-sized interplanetary dust at 1 AU between the plane of the ecliptic and the normal to the plane of the ecliptic.
