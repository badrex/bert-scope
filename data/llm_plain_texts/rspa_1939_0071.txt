tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the radioactive substances of long half-period obtained by bombarding titanium and scandium with high-energy deuterons. They discovered examples of K-electron capture, nuclear isomerism, and branching decay of isotopes to neighboring isobaric nuclei. The experiments provided conclusive proof of electron capture and some quantitative data concerning the ratio of the probability of electron capture to that of positron emission.
