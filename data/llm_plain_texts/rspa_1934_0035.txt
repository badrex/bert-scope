tldr: This article investigates the structure and formula of 12-phosphotungstic acid, a type of heteropolyacid. The author reviews previous research on the topic and presents a detailed analysis of the acid's properties, including its ability to form stable salts with various metals and its tendency to crystallize with cubic symmetry. The author also discusses the different formulae proposed for 12-phosphotungstic acid and its dehydration process, concluding that the classical Rosenheim-Miolati formula is incompatible with the dehydrated forms of the acid.
