tldr: The authors studied the effect of human interferon-a on the expression of surface antigens in the human cell line Molt 4. They found that interferon increased the membrane expression of HLA-A, B, and G but not other surface antigens. This increase was due to an increase in the rate of synthesis of HLA and P2m molecules, leading to enhanced expression of antigens on the cell membrane and increased secretion of free 02m. The study demonstrated that interferon treatment affects the rate of synthesis of HLA and P2m molecules, which in turn affects the expression of cell surface antigens.
