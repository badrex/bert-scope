tldr: The study investigates the variation and structure of the eyes in the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria, and how it affects their vision and behavior. The locusts have vertically striped eyes with brown stripes and cream-colored interstripes. The research explains how the differences in eye structure and pigmentation lead to distinct vision capabilities in solitaria and gregaria individuals, affecting their behavior and gregarization.
