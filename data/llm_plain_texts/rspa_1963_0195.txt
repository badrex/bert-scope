tldr: The authors present a domain theory for the skin-effect impedance and complex permeability of ferromagnetic sheets. They develop a model that includes the effects of finite surface energy and inertia of domain walls, relaxation damping of their motion, and short-range fluctuations in domain width and restoring forces. The study calculates the frequency dependence of the electrical resistance and inductance of a ferromagnetic strip, providing a theoretical basis for interpreting measurements of resistance in iron strips over a wide range of frequencies.
