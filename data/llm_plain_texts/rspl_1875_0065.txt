tldr: Prof. T. Andrews conducted experiments to study the gaseous state of matter, particularly carbon dioxide, at high pressures. He found that the coefficient of expansion for heat under constant pressure changes with both pressure and temperature. Andrews discovered that the law of Gay-Lussac does not hold true in the ordinary gaseous state, and the dilatation by heat is a complex function rather than a simple one. His research also revealed the properties of the gaseous state and the effects of internal attractive forces and external pressure on volume.
