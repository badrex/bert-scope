tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the absolute cross-section and angular distribution of -particles from the D-T and D-He3 reactions using low-energy deuteron bombardment. They found that the reactions were isotropic and their total cross-sections could be expressed by the Gamow theory of penetration of the Coulomb barrier. However, the simple theory assuming the same energy-independent nuclear parameters for the mirror nuclei could not account for the observed cross-sections of these two reactions.
