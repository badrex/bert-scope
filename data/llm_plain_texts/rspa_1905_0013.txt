tldr: The author conducted continuous observations of the rate of dissipation of electric charges in the open air, finding that the conductivity of the air for both positive and negative electricity is irregular. They discovered that negative electricity is dispersed more rapidly than positive, and that atmospheric conductivity is affected by weather patterns such as wind direction and strength. This study provides valuable insights into the relationship between atmospheric electrical charge and weather phenomena.
