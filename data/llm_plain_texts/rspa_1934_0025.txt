tldr: The authors used a camera with revolving lenses to study the development of lightning discharges. By comparing the images captured by the two lenses, they were able to determine the direction and speed of the developing discharge. The study found that 72% of the observed strokes had leader strokes, which are preliminary to the main strokes. This research provided valuable insights into the behavior of lightning and its impact on the environment.
