tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the absorption and dispersion of ultrasonic waves in acetic acid. They found that the excess absorption can be attributed to a relaxation phenomenon involving the perturbation of molecular equilibrium between single and double molecules of acetic acid. The results confirm both dispersion and the maximum value of absorption required by a relaxation process.
