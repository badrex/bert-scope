tldr: The authors studied the modification of cytochrome oxidase by alkali and urea using spectrophotometry. They discovered that exposure to high pH or 8m urea alters the enzyme's absorption spectra, shifting the a-band from 605 to 595 nm and the y-band from 445 to 436 nm. This research provides insights into the nature of cytochrome oxidase and its derivatives.
