tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the cause of the luminousness of sea water. They found that the putrefaction of animal substances in the water, such as fish, causes the sea to glow. The salt in the water speeds up the putrefaction process, leading to increased luminosity. This discovery helps explain the mysterious glowing seen in the sea at night and the role of salt in the process.
