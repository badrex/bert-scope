tldr: Researchers have identified a 25 kDa protein protoxin in Bacillus thuringiensis var. kyushuensis that becomes cytolytic when activated. This broad-spectrum toxin is toxic to mosquito, lepidopteran, and mammalian cells, and can form cation-selective channels in a planar lipid bilayer. The toxin's potential for controlling insect pests and its mode of action are discussed.
