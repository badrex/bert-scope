tldr: This article discusses the use of accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) to study isotopes 10Be and 14C in the Earth system. The authors explain how these isotopes help in understanding solar-terrestrial relations, carbon cycle dynamics, and climate history. They also describe various natural archives, such as ice, organic matter, and sediments, which record information about the Earth system.
