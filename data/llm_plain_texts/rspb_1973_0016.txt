tldr: The author investigates the fine structure and histochemistry of the digestive diverticula in the protobranchiate bivalve Nucula sulcata. They discover that the digestive diverticula serve an absorptive and digestive function, with different cell types playing specific roles in the process. The study uses electron microscopy and various staining techniques to analyze the cells and their functions within the digestive system.
