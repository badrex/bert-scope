tldr: The authors present a theoretical model for metal-insulator-semiconductor solar cells, which improves upon previous models by considering recombination effects through interfacial states, transition regions, and bulk regions. The model also develops more accurate relations for the barrier height and potential drops in the cell, leading to higher predicted efficiencies, especially for low values of the interfacial density of states. Numerical results are given for a silicon contact.
