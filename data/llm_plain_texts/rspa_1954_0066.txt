tldr: This article investigates the temperature variation of diamagnetic susceptibility in metals and alloys, focusing on the behavior of orbital electrons near the Fermi surface. The author calculates the temperature-dependent susceptibility for various forms of energy surfaces and discusses the theoretical results in relation to experimental findings. The study provides a basis for understanding and correlating the temperature-dependent and concentration-dependent magnetic properties of low-concentration diamagnetic alloy sequences.
