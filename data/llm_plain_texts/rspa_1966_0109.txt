tldr: The authors studied the photochemical processes in acidified solutions of Fe(II) and potassium ferrocyanide. They found that the quantum yield of nitrogen and hydrogen depends on the acidity and concentration of the solution. The results suggest that there is a second primary photochemical act occurring concurrently with the first, which results in the formation of a hydrogen atom directly. This second process has a quantum yield less than that of the first process but occurs more frequently at higher ratios.
