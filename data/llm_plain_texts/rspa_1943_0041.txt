tldr: The authors conducted experiments on stannous sulphide to study its electrical conductivity and defect structure. They found that stannous sulphide is an electronic conductor at all temperatures and that its conductivity is influenced by its stoichiometric composition and past thermal treatment. The low-temperature conductivity is attributed to a stoichiometric excess of non-metal in the lattice, while the high-temperature conductivity is due to intrinsic conduction of the lattice. The authors also investigated the effect of chemical treatments on the conductivity of stannous sulphide, such as exposure to hydrogen, oxygen, or hydrogen sulphide.
