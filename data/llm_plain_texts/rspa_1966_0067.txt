tldr: The authors studied the effects of surface films on the damping of eddies at a free surface of a turbulent liquid. They discovered that even a small amount of surface-active material can set up gradients of surface tension, which significantly damps the eddies and reduces the rate of surface renewal, thus slowing down mass transfer across the liquid surface.
