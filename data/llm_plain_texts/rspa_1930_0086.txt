tldr: This article explores the energy of crystal lattices using perturbation theory in quantum mechanics. The authors calculate the potential energy of a crystal by considering the interactions between atoms in a lattice and how they change as the atoms are brought closer together. They also discuss the differences in binding energy between diatomic gases and crystals, and how the mean energy of a crystal depends on the simple electrostatic potential energy and the interchange integral.
