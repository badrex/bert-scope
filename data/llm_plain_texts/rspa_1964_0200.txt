tldr: This article discusses the ion composition of the upper F-region of the ionosphere using data from the first Anglo-American satellite, Ariel I. The authors present a method for analyzing the ion mass spectrometer data and report on the relative concentrations of various ion species. The study provides a global picture of the ionosphere and contributes to the understanding of the upper atmosphere's behavior.
