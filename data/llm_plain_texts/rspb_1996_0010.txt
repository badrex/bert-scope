tldr: Researchers developed a method to create large and representative cDNA libraries from a small number of identified leech neurons using polymerase chain reaction-based technology. The libraries contain a high proportion of cDNAs larger than 500 base pairs and are free from contaminating rRNA or PCR artifacts. This is the first report of constructing cDNA libraries from identified neurons, providing a valuable resource for studying gene expression in the nervous system.
