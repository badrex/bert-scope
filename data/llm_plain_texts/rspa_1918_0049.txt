tldr: The authors study magnetic storms and their effects on Earth's magnetic field. They identify general and local storm variations, as well as irregular fluctuations in the magnetic force. The study shows that intense storms can extend irregular fluctuations to lower latitudes, and that these fluctuations are related to auroral displays. The research is based on data from 12 observatories during 40 magnetic storms between 1902 and 1911.
