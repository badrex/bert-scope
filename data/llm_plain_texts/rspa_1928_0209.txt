tldr: This article investigates the increase of thermionic currents from tungsten in strong electric fields. The authors found that Schottky's theoretical expression does not quite fit the experimental results, and they suggest modifying the equation to account for the influence of neighboring electrons close to the surface. The study also highlights the effect of surface impurities on the experimental results.
