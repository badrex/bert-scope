  - Nitrifying bacteria
tldr: This article investigates the relationship between microorganisms, specifically bacteria, and the decay of stone. The authors discuss previous research on the topic and present their findings on bacterial populations in decaying and sound stone. They also explore the role of nitrifying bacteria in stone decay and suggest that further investigation is needed to understand the full extent of microbial involvement in this process.
