tldr: This article investigates the contribution of central forces to the elastic constants of metals using Fuchs's relations. The authors calculate the individual values of the elastic constants and find that the central forces do not satisfy the Cauchy relation. They also determine the contribution of free electrons to the elastic constants by subtracting the central force elastic constants from the experimental values. The results show that the electron gas contributes a single elastic constant, which is not equal to the experimental Cauchy discrepancy.
