tldr: This article discusses the biology and ecology of nitrogen fixation in symbiotic associations of non-leguminous plants. It explores the endophyte's role in these plants, the challenges in isolating the endophyte, and the need for further research on host specificity and root invasion by the symbiont. The article also highlights various examples of non-leguminous plants, such as Alnus, Myrica, and Cycads, and their unique symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing organisms.
