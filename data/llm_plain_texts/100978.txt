tldr: The author, R. Boyle, conducted experiments to study the effects of varying atmospheric pressure on liquids and their impact on human health. He used glass bubbles filled with air to observe how changes in atmospheric pressure caused them to rise or sink in water. This research supported Boyle's belief that the atmosphere has a significant impact on human health and could be used to develop new tools, such as baroscopes and hygrometers, to monitor atmospheric conditions.
