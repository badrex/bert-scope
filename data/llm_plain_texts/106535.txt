tldr: In 1775, during a severe drought on the island of Sumatra, fish of various species were found dead or dying on the coast. The author, William Marsden, observed this unusual phenomenon and speculated that the lack of fresh water in the sea might have caused the fish to die. This event raised questions about the impact of drought on marine life and the ocean's ecosystem.
