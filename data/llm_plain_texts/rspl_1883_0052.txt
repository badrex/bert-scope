tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the electric discharge and its effects on various gases and conditions. They studied the influence of dimensions and shapes of vessels on the pressure of minimum resistance, the behavior of discharges in miniature tubes, and the differences in discharges in dry air and air saturated with moisture. They also investigated the discharge in tubes from two batteries, the effects of external resistance, and the electrical conditions of gases near the negative terminal.
