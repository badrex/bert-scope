tldr: The authors conducted laboratory tests to determine the magnetic properties of certain igneous rocks and their impact on magnetic surveys. They found that rocks at depth possess weak but uniform magnetization, which is crucial for accurate magnetic survey results. The study also discusses the effects of oxidation, weathering, and cross-magnetization on the magnetic properties of rocks.
