tldr: The author calculates the energy levels of benzene using a basis of non-polar and polar structures. They find that the role of polar structures is significant in determining the energy levels and spectral transitions of benzene. The study also suggests a new assignment for the 2080 A bands of benzene and discusses the limitations of molecular orbital theory in explaining the intense region at 1830 A and the weaker absorption at 2080 A.
