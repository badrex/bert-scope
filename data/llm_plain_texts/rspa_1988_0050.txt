  - Helmholtz equation
  - Green's functions
  - Iterative methods
tldr: The authors present an iterative method for solving boundary integral equations in acoustics, focusing on the Helmholtz equation. They demonstrate that by modifying the Green's function, the boundary integral equations can be made uniquely solvable for all frequencies, allowing for efficient iterative solutions.
