tldr: The authors discuss the potential relevance of critical phenomena, specifically self-organized criticality, in large-scale evolution. They explore the concept of scale-free properties and how they may be connected to extinction events, suggesting that large and small extinctions could be part of the same dynamic process. The authors also mention the controversy surrounding these ideas and the need for further research to test their validity.
