tldr: The authors conducted experiments on decerebrate preparations to study the influence of labyrinthine and cervical influences on myotatic reflexes. They found that the knee extensor stretch reflex is influenced by Magnus-de Kleyn tonic reflexes and that the amount of tension developed by the quadriceps cruris in its myotatic reflex varies with the amplitude of the passive stretch. The authors also observed that the myotatic reflex undergoes pronounced inhibition when a passive stretch is applied to the ipsilateral knee-flexor muscles.
