tldr: This study investigates two measures of Darwinian fitness, the Malthusian parameter and entropy, in human populations. The authors find that entropy, which measures the spread of fecundity-mortality schedules, is a more suitable measure of fitness under constant environmental conditions. This research has implications for understanding the persistence of diseases and genetic traits in populations.
