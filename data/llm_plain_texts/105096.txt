tldr: 'A letter from Wm. Dixon, Esq., to Mr. W. Watson, describes the discovery of unusual vegetable balls in a freshwater lake in Yorkshire. These balls are hollow, irregularly spherical, and range in size from 1.5 to 3 inches in diameter. They are composed of a deep-green mossy substance and are covered with short villi externally. Dixon notes that they have not been described in any botanic writers he has consulted.'
