tldr: The study investigates the ultrastructure of graniferous tracheary elements in the haustorium of Exocarpus bidwillii, a root hemi-parasite of the Santalaceae family. The tracheary elements contain granules within their lumina and have mostly imperforate walls. The researchers suggest that the vascular core and its graniferous tracheary elements may help regulate the pressure and flow of xylem sap entering the parasite from the host.
