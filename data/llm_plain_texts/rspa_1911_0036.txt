tldr: The authors investigate the relationship between lead and uranium in rock minerals and propose a method to measure geological time using the ratio of lead to uranium. They find that the rate of lead production is proportional to the amount of uranium remaining unchanged, allowing them to calculate the age of minerals through the disintegration of uranium. This method provides a way to determine the age of rocks and the Earth's history.
