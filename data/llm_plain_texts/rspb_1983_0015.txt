tldr: The author discusses their studies on antitumour antibiotics, low molecular mass immunity-enhancing compounds, and microbial products that inhibit the generation of cells that suppress immunity. Among the discoveries, bleomycin has been used in cancer treatment, and new antibiotics like aclacinomycin and spergaulin have been developed. The author also highlights the importance of compounds that can suppress the generation of suppressor cells and proposes a combination treatment for cancer cure.
