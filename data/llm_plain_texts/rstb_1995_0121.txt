tldr: The article discusses the evolution of eukaryotic cellular processes and how conservation and diversification have contributed to the development of metazoan organisms. It highlights the importance of understanding the common processes, such as the cytoskeleton, cell cycle, and signal transduction pathways, and how they have evolved to support the complexity of multicellular organisms. The article also explores the role of transcription and signal transduction in establishing contingency and linkage, which allows for the diversification of cellular processes and the evolution of multicellularity.
