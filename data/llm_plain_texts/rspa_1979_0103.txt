tldr: This article presents a simple model to demonstrate the effects of ocean geometry on tides, focusing on the interaction between the Atlantic and Southern Oceans. The model uses narrow canals to represent the oceans and includes the effects of Earth's rotation through second-order terms. The results show how the Atlantic tides interact with those of the Southern Ocean and provide insights into the propagation and distribution of tides.
