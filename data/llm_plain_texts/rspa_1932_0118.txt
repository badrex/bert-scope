tldr: This article investigates the catalytic decomposition of nitrous oxide by halogens, specifically iodine, bromine, and chlorine. The reactions are found to be of the first order with respect to nitrous oxide, and the authors propose several possible reaction mechanisms. The study provides insights into the role of halogen atoms and molecules as effective catalysts in these reactions.
