tldr: This study investigates the motor cortex functions in monkeys using electric stimulation. The researchers found that different parts of the cortex are responsible for various movements, such as head and eye movements, lower limb, and upper limb. The findings provide insights into the organization of the motor cortex and its role in controlling body movements.
