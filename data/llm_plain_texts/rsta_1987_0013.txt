tldr: The authors study the metamorphism of the Dalradian rocks in western Ireland, focusing on the NW Mayo and Connemara inliers. They analyze the pressures and temperatures of metamorphism and discuss the changes in conditions with time and their relation to the development of structures. The metamorphic and structural models provide important constraints on the Grampian orogeny during which most of the metamorphism took place.
