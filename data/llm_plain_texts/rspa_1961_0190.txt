tldr: The authors studied the stability of viscous flow in a curved channel under the influence of a magnetic field. They found that the critical number for the onset of instability depends on the strength of the magnetic field and the electrical conductivity of the fluid. The research has implications for understanding fluid behavior in various engineering and scientific applications.
