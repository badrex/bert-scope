tldr: This article examines the periglacial environment and permafrost conditions in Great Britain during the Devensian Cold Stage. The authors discuss the presence of ice wedge polygons, pingos, and thaw lakes as indicators of permafrost, and analyze their distribution and formation in different regions of the country. The study provides insights into the climate and environmental conditions during the last cold stage, helping to understand the evolution of the Earth's cryosphere.
