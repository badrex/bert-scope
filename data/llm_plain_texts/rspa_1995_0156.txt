tldr: This article studies the macroscopic plastic response of composites with strain gradient effects. The authors develop a deformation theory of strain gradient plasticity, which assumes that the strain energy density depends on both the von Mises strain invariant and a curvature invariant. They derive bounds and estimates for the overall plastic response of statistically homogeneous and isotropic strain gradient composites using a nonlinear variational principle. The results demonstrate a size effect for the plastic response of two-phase composites.
