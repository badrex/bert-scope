tldr: The author presents a new method for tracing complex curves, which has been found useful in various applications. The method is capable of great extension and has been previously employed in the 'English Mechanic' of December 29, 1882. The author also mentions related works by other researchers, such as Roberts, Cayley, and others, but their focus does not overlap with the narrow area of the present paper.
