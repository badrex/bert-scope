tldr: This article discusses pulsar magnetospheres and the mechanisms through which pulsars lose energy. It explores the alignment of magnetic and rotation axes, the acceleration of electrons, and the processes of angular momentum dissipation. The article also examines the role of electric fields, the generation of a quasi-neutral plasma, and the importance of understanding the interaction between electromagnetic and particle fields in pulsar magnetospheres.
