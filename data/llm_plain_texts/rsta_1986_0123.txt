tldr: The authors developed a non-destructive ultrasonic method to measure internal temperature distribution in solidifying metal bodies, focusing on steel. They used the relationship between ultrasound velocity and temperature to convert an ultrasonic-velocity distribution (tomogram) into an internal temperature distribution. This technique can be applied to other materials, such as aluminum, and has potential applications in materials processing.
