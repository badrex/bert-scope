tldr: The author examines new Namurian bivalve faunas and their significance in the origin of Carbonicola and the colonization of Carboniferous deltaic environments. They discover that British late Namurian Carbonicola faunas were probably derived from marine ancestors in late time, and that bivalve burrows played a crucial role in their evolution and adaptation to changing environmental conditions.
