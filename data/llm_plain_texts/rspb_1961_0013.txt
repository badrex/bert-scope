tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the transmission and alteration of bovine y-globulin in young rats. They discovered that bovine agglutinins do not pass from the gut into the circulation, while substantial amounts of labeled bovine y-globulin reach the circulation. The labeled protein that enters the circulation retains its bovine antigenicity, suggesting that a substantial proportion of molecules have avoided destruction. The authors also found that the transmission of labeled bovine y-globulin increases upon a second presentation to the gut.
