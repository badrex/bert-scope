tldr: The authors conducted a quantitative study on the role of microtubules in the positioning of the vegetative nucleus and generative cell in the angiosperm pollen tube. They found that microtubules help in positioning the nuclei by balancing stresses on their surfaces and linking them to microtubule organizing centers at the cell membrane. This study provides insights into the importance of microtubules in the interaction with the embryo sac and the delivery of sperms produced by the generative cell division.
