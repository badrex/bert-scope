tldr: This study examines the influence of geographic isolation on the skull development of the green monkey (Cercopithecus aethiops sabaeus) on the island of St. Kitts and its African counterpart. The research found that the St. Kitts green monkey's skulls have a higher bilateral variance compared to the African green monkey, indicating less developmental stability. This suggests that the changes observed in the St. Kitts monkeys may be due to the action of selection on the genetic constitution of the original stock of monkeys that became established on the island.
