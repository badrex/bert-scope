tldr: This article discusses the Scelidothere, a large extinct terrestrial sloth, and provides an anatomical analysis of its fossil bones. The author compares the bones to those of other large extinct animals, particularly those of the Edentate order. The Scelidothere was a quadruped with a length of 8 to 10 feet, and it had long and strong claws, a long and muscular tongue, and was more closely related to sloths than to ant-eaters.
