tldr: The author investigates the energetics of muscle relaxation and finds that most of the heat produced during relaxation comes from the dissipation of mechanical energy when the muscle ceases to bear the load. The study also shows that relaxation is primarily a passive process, with minimal involvement of chemical changes associated with muscular activity.
