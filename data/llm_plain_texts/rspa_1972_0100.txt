tldr: The author presents a mathematically rigorous axiomatic approach to classical thermodynamics, using differential geometry and topology to derive well-known results such as the existence of entropy and absolute temperature. The study is based on a set of postulates closely related to the traditional laws of thermodynamics, providing a more economical and robust foundation for the field.
