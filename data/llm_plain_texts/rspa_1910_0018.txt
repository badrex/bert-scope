tldr: The author presents a new method for calculating diffraction figures using the heliometer. They use mechanical integration and Bessel functions to evaluate the light intensity in the diffraction image. The new method allows for more accurate calculations and extends the range of values that can be considered, improving our understanding of diffraction patterns.
