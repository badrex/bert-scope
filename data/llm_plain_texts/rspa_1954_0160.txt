tldr: The authors studied the thermal decomposition of chlorobenzene and found that it is a predominantly homogeneous process. The decomposition produces hydrogen and hydrogen chloride, with no gaseous carbon compounds formed. The remaining carbon and hydrogen are deposited as a graphite-like solid. The reaction is kinetically complex, and the authors propose a chain reaction mechanism. The fully inhibited reaction appears to be a unimolecular process.
