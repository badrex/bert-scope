tldr: The authors analyze the influence of a flameholder on a plane flame, focusing on its static stability. They use large-activation energy asymptotics to derive a theory that shows the relation between the mass flux of reactants through the flameholder and the burnt-gas temperature. The flameholder's conductance plays a significant role in the equilibrium between the flame and the flameholder, affecting the flame's behavior and stability.
