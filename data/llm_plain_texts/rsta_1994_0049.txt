tldr: This article studies the complex dynamics of impact oscillators, particularly the behavior of chattering and its relation to periodic motion. The authors develop a map to analyze the system and explore the role of chattering, incomplete chatter, and sticking in the dynamics of the oscillator. They also identify the sticking region and its significant impact on the domain of attraction of periodic solutions.
