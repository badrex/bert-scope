tldr: The authors explore the twistor description of massless fields with source on an analytic world-line. They prove that all right-handed massless fields have a twistor description in terms of relative cohomology groups, and that left-handed sourced massless fields can be obtained by quotienting the sheaves. The study uses techniques like the Penrose transform and the analysis of conserved quantities to provide a comprehensive understanding of the twistor description of sourced fields.
