tldr: This article presents a quantitative method for studying pleochroic haloes, the beautiful phenomenon of radioactivity in minerals like biotite. The authors develop a halo photometer to measure the blackening in haloes, providing a more accurate and objective way to study these fascinating structures. They classify haloes into four groups based on their development stages and discuss the differences between haloes from two different biotite samples.
