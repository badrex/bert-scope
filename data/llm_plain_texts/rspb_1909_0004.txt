tldr: This study examines the proportion of male and female births among white and colored populations in Cuba. The author finds that white populations have a higher proportion of male births, while colored populations have a more balanced sex ratio. The study also reveals that illegitimate unions result in a higher proportion of female births, suggesting that individual factors, rather than heredity, influence the sex ratio. Additionally, the author identifies two distinct breeding seasons in both white and colored populations, which coincide with changes in climate.
