tldr: The author studied the stomach of the Zariffa, a ruminant quadruped, and found that it has four cavities. The stomach lining has a similar efflorescence to that of a bullock, but it is more prominent. The second cavity lacks the cellular structure found in other ruminants, while the third and fourth cavities exhibit no peculiarities. The Zariffa's diet of acacia leaves and twigs is so succulent that it does not need to be moistened in the second stomach, unlike grass-eating animals. Three drawings of the stomach structure accompany the paper.
