tldr: The authors propose a five-dimensional metric to explain the relationship between charge and mass in particles, such as electrons and protons. They suggest that the metric can be used to derive the first-order equations of quantum theory and explain the differences between positive and negative charges. The authors also discuss the conservation of five-dimensional momentum and its implications for particle interactions.
