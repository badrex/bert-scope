tldr: The authors used X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to study the effects of ion bombardment on diamond surfaces. They found that ion bombardment causes significant structural changes, displacing many carbon atoms to sites of lower coordination. The study also revealed that the implanted argon distribution follows an exponential decay with depth. The authors also discussed the implications of their findings for understanding the processes involved in surface chemistry and the potential applications of ion implantation techniques in diamond.
