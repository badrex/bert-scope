tldr: C.F. Shoenbein, a Professor of Chemistry, supports his previous findings on the identity of odoriferous principles released during electric discharges, water electrolysis, and phosphorus' slow action on atmospheric air. He identifies this principle as ozone, a simple body and a constituent of nitrogen. Shoenbein believes that nitrogen is a compound of hydrogen and ozone, and he explains the release of ozone during these processes as a partial decomposition of nitrogen due to hydrogen combining with oxygen.
