tldr: The author, John Strange, collected and described uncommon and perfect specimens of spongiae from the coast of Italy. He shared these descriptions with the Royal Society, hoping they would find them interesting and valuable for further research. The specimens included three types of sponges, one of which had never been described before. Strange also discussed the lack of progress in the study of zoophytes in Italy, despite the abundance of marine life along its coasts.
