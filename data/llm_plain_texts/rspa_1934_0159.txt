region of smaller initial pressure. The curve is not, however, as clearly segmented as that for acetaldehyde. The behaviour of propionic aldehyde is thus intermediate between that of acetaldehyde and ethane. The curve for propionic aldehyde is, however, more clearly segmented than that for propane, which shows no evidence of a " unimolecular " region.
