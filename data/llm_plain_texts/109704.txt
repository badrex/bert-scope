tldr: The author discusses the use of magnesia in preventing the formation of uric acid and improving the composition of urine. Magnesia was found to be effective in reducing the quantity of uric acid in patients' urine, helping to prevent kidney stones and other health issues. The author also compares the effects of magnesia to those of alkalies, such as soda and potash, and finds that magnesia is more effective due to its insolubility and slower action.
