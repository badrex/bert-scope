tldr: This article investigates the capillary instability of a jet carrying an axial current with or without a longitudinal magnetic field. It explores the effects of conductivity, surface tension, and magnetic fields on the growth rate of instability. The study finds that a mode of maximum instability always exists for any value of conductivity, and the growth rate decreases with an increase in conductivity. The presence of surface tension also influences the instability.
