tldr: This article presents a theoretical and experimental investigation of magnetic induction and its reversal in spherical iron shells. The authors explore the effects of magnetizing coils, demagnetization processes, and the behavior of magnetic fields in iron shells. They also discuss the role of eddy currents and their impact on demagnetization efficiency. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of magnetic phenomena in iron materials and their applications.
