tldr: The article investigates the probability of transition processes involving low-energy photons using Dirac's method of field quantization. It shows that the treatment using an expansion in powers of the fine-structure constant is inconsistent, leading to an infinite value for the probability when integrating over low-energy photons. This indicates that Dirac's method does not resolve the 'infra-red catastrophe' and suggests that an alternative, approximate approach should be used for processes involving low-energy photons.
