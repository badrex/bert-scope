semantic_tags:
  - Bacterial cell walls
  - Teichoic acids
  - Peptidoglycan
  - Antibiotics
  - Bacterial structure
tldr: The author discusses teichoic acids and the molecular structure of bacterial walls, explaining their importance in bacterial cell walls' rigidity, strength, and permeability. Teichoic acids are polymeric substances containing glycerol or ribitol, phosphate, and other components. The author also describes the impact of antibiotics on bacterial walls and their biosynthesis.
