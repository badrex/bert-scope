tldr: The study investigates the role of the host in ammonium assimilation in green hydra symbiosis. It shows that the host has a significant role in ammonium assimilation when symbiotic algae are present. The findings suggest that the host may regulate the size of its symbiont population by controlling the supply of nitrogen to them, which could be a mechanism for symbiont regulation.
