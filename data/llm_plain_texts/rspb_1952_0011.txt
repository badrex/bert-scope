tldr: The authors conducted experiments with anterior pituitary gland grafts in hypophysectomized rats to study the role of the hypothalamus in hormone regulation. They found that grafts placed under the median eminence acquired connections with the hypophysial portal vessels, allowing them to maintain normal function. This supports the idea that the secretion of anterior pituitary hormones is under hypothalamic control.
