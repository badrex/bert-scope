tldr: The authors synthesized and studied the properties of higher n-fatty acids and their derivatives, focusing on those with even carbon content between 28 and 38 carbon atoms. They determined melting points, crystal spacings, and other properties, providing a basis for identifying naturally occurring fatty acids. The research also involved the synthesis of a small quantity of an acid with 46 carbon atoms.
