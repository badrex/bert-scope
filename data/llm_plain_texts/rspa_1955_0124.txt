tldr: This study investigates the nuclear interactions of 600 MeV protons using Ilford G5 emulsions exposed to protons from the Birmingham synchrotron. The researchers found a mean free path for nuclear interaction of 33.7 f^cm and analyzed the size distribution of stars, comparing it with previous studies at 400 and 1000 MeV proton energies. The results provide insights into the behavior of high-energy protons and contribute to the understanding of nuclear reactions and particle interactions.
