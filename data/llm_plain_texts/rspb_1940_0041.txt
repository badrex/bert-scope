tldr: The authors conducted X-ray studies on the molecular structure of myosin, a protein found in muscle tissue. They discovered that myosin shares similarities with keratin, a protein found in hair, in terms of molecular configuration and elastic properties. The authors also found that myosin undergoes a process called supercontraction, which involves a reversible folding of the protein chain system. This discovery helps explain the contractile properties of muscle tissue and the extensibility of hair.
