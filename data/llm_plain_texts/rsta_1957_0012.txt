tldr: This article describes the adaptation of the astatic magnetometer for measuring the permanent magnetization of rocks, focusing on igneous and sedimentary rocks in Great Britain. The authors explain the general theory of the magnetometer design, the measurement process, and the necessary precautions to obtain accurate results. The technique is useful for determining the direction of the geomagnetic field in remote geological epochs and for dating sedimentary rocks.
