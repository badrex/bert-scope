tldr: This article examines Einstein's new theory of a field containing both gravitational and electromagnetic phenomena. The authors apply the theory to a specific case and find that the new equations are not equivalent to the old ones beyond the first order. The study also explores the law suggested by Einstein but only finds it to be true to a first approximation.
