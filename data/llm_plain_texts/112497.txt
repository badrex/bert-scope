tldr: This study investigates the function of the caudal heart in eels, revealing it to be a lymphatic heart rather than a blood heart. The force of the lymph-stream from the caudal heart influences and accelerates the flow of blood in the caudal vein, playing a crucial role in the eel's circulatory system.
