tldr: This article investigates the effect of temperature on the constitution of water in electrolyte solutions. The authors found that as temperature increases, the Raman band of water shifts to higher frequencies, indicating a change in the water equilibrium between single, double, and triple molecules. The study also shows that the extent and complexity of hydration in solutions vary with temperature, with hydrates being more stable and complex at lower temperatures.
