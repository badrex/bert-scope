tldr: The author discusses recent developments in understanding the origin of the Solar System, focusing on isotopic anomalies, fossil radioactivities, and deuterated molecules found in meteorites. These findings suggest that the classical protosolar nebula model needs to be extended, and the presence of a supernova in the vicinity of the forming planetary system is proposed as a possible explanation. The author also explores the role of molecular cloud processes in the formation of deuterated molecules in the Solar System.
