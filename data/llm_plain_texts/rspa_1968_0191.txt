tldr: This study investigates the role of point defects in the thermal decomposition of ammonium perchlorate. The authors find a correlation between the isothermal d.c. electrical conductance of single crystals and the extent of decomposition, indicating that charge carriers play a significant role in the process. They propose a probable defect structure for ammonium perchlorate, with Frenkel-type defects below 250Â°C and Schottky disorder at higher temperatures, which explains the phenomenon of only 30% decomposition below 250Â°C and 100% above this temperature.
