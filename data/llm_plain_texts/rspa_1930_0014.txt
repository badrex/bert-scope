tldr: The authors studied the structure and behavior of surface films made from various esters of fatty acids. They found evidence of flexibility in long hydrocarbon chains, which supports the theory of stereochemistry requiring free rotation in carbon-to-carbon linkages. The research also provides insights into the formation of rings in organic compounds and the orientation of molecules in surface films.
