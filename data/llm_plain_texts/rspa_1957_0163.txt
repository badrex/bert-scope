tldr: The authors discuss the mechanisms of work-hardening and slip-band formation in metals, focusing on the different stages of hardening and the role of dislocations in the process. They explain how work-hardening prevents the development of dislocation loops and how internal stresses contribute to the hardening process. The authors also explore the connection between work-hardening and fatigue in metals.
