tldr: This study investigates the temperature of insects and its connection with respiration and circulation. The author found that insects with higher temperatures are usually volant and diurnal species. The temperature of insects in different stages of life, such as larva, pupa, and imago, varies, with the imago having a higher temperature. The author also examines the influence of various factors on the temperature of insects, such as inactivity, sleep, hibernation, and excitement. Insects living in societies, like bees, also have specific temperature patterns. The study concludes that animal heat results directly from the changes during respiration and that the insect's body temperature is regulated by the exhalation of gaseous matter.
