tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the nature of "Golgi bodies" in fixed material. They discovered that variations in fixatives used produce different structures in the same colloidal solution, suggesting that structures appearing constantly in similar cells with different fixatives might be more likely to be present in living cells. The authors also observed various granules, fibrils, and lipins in the cytoplasm of cells, which may be taken into cells from the solution or originate within the cells.
