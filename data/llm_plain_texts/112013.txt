tldr: The author, Joseph Bayma, introduces the concept of molecular mechanics, aiming to determine the intrinsic constitution of matter and the laws governing its behavior. He discusses the properties of extension, inertia, and active power in matter, emphasizing the importance of understanding the actions of elements at both microscopic and macroscopic levels. Bayma also proposes that all natural phenomena can be explained by mechanical forces, including chemical, electric, magnetic, and calorific actions.
