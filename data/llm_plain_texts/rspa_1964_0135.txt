tldr: The authors developed a technique to chemically prepare specific trapped hydrocarbon radicals using a gas-solid system. They used a rotating cryostat to create a reaction where radicals were trapped on a solid surface, preventing unwanted reactions. The trapped radicals were then characterized by their electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra. This method allowed for the study of single reaction steps and the preparation of specific trapped radicals.
