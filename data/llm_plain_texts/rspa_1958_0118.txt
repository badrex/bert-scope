tldr: The authors investigate the initiation and growth of explosions in solids, focusing on the ignition of primary explosives by electric discharges. They explore the factors that influence the minimum ignition energy and identify two ignition mechanisms: contact and gaseous discharges. The study reveals that the sensitivity of primary explosives to these discharges depends on the physical and electrical characteristics of the discharge system.
