tldr: The article explores the problem of finding an optimal strategy for organisms in a population with fluctuating environments. It introduces a game theoretical approach to dynamic optimization, considering organisms as players in a cooperative game. The optimal strategy is characterized as an evolutionarily stable strategy for a constant environment game, maximizing the fitness of the genotype as a whole. The study provides a framework for understanding and predicting the behavior of organisms in unpredictable environments.
