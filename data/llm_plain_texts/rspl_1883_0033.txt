tldr: The author compares the pelvic structure of Thylacoleo carnifex, a marsupial carnivore from Australia, with other marsupials and carnivorous mammals. They find that Thylacoleo shares some similarities with Felis Leo, a big cat, but also has unique features that set it apart. This study contributes to our understanding of the evolution and classification of marsupials.
