tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the mechanisms behind fat accumulation in acute liver injury caused by toxic agents like carbon tetrachloride, dimethylnitrosamine, and thioacetamide. They found that fat accumulation occurs due to an inhibition of triglyceride secretion and synthesis in the liver. The study also showed that promethazine HCl treatment can prevent mitochondrial injury and hepatic necrosis without affecting the fatty liver.
