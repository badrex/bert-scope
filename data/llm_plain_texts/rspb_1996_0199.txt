tldr: This study investigates the relationship between cloacal protuberance size and stored sperm reserves in Australian fairy-wrens, a species known for intense sperm competition. Researchers found significant intraspecific correlations between the size of a male's protuberance and the number of sperm stored in two of the three species studied. Males of these species had extreme numbers of sperm in their cloacal protuberances, up to 8.3 billion for splendid fairy-wrens, which should be available for a single ejaculate. These findings support the sperm competition hypothesis for the evolution of cloacal protuberances and highlight extreme sperm production as a possible outcome of sperm competition.
