tldr: This study investigates the oxidation of gaseous ethane and the role of aldehydes in the reaction process. The authors found that aldehydes play a significant part in the inhibition period and that the main chain process involves the oxidation of ethylene, which can be continued by ethane. The reaction is influenced by the surface properties of the reaction vessel, and packing can decrease the inhibition period.
