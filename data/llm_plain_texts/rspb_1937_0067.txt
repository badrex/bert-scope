tldr: The authors investigated the protein composition of nerve axoplasm and found that it has at least two components. They discovered that the proteins can be extracted using different methods and have distinct properties, such as solubility and precipitation in various solutions. This research provides insights into the structure and function of proteins in nerve tissue.
