tldr: The authors conducted freezing-point measurements on dilute aqueous solutions of sulfate salts of six bivalent metals to study ionic association in bi-bivalent electrolytes. They analyzed the results using the Debye-Huckel theory and the theory of incomplete dissociation, comparing their findings with previous methods. This study provides a better understanding of the physical status of dissociation constants and the behavior of bi-bivalent electrolytes in aqueous solutions.
