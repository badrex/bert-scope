tldr: The authors investigated the hyperfine structure and Zeeman effect of the resonance lines of lithium using atomic beams and absorption experiments. They observed hyperfine structure doublets in the absorption spectrum of Li7 and found that the Zeeman components of the stronger resonance line agreed with the nuclear spin value. This study provided insights into the atomic and nuclear properties of lithium, contributing to the understanding of alkali metals' atomic structure.
