tldr: Researchers discovered a new group of filterable organisms in sewage that can be cultivated in various sizes. These organisms were found in all samples of raw sewage from four London districts but not in tap water or fecal material from humans, pigs, rabbits, or rats. The most suitable medium for their cultivation was Hartley's digest broth, and they could be killed by heat. The organisms' morphology was studied using dark ground illumination and staining techniques, revealing various forms and sizes.
