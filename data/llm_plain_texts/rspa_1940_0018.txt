tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the specific heat of superconducting mercury, indium, and thallium. They accurately measured the threshold field curves and used mathematical polynomials to calculate the specific heat differences between the superconducting and normal states. The results showed that the specific heat of these metals in the superconducting state is negligible only very close to absolute zero, and the specific heat differences follow a logarithmic law with a high degree of accuracy.
