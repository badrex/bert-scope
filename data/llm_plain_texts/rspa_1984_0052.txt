tldr: The authors investigate the contrast obtained in the reflection-scanning acoustic microscope from abrupt elastic discontinuities not parallel to the surface of the specimen. They find that Rayleigh waves play a dominant role in the contrast observed in the acoustic microscope, and that reflection of Rayleigh waves can significantly affect the contrast. The authors also study the effect of defocus on the contrast and provide a theoretical explanation for the observed phenomena.
