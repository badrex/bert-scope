tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the electrical effect produced by vibrating metals, specifically focusing on the impact of rusting on a wire's ability to generate an electrical effect. They discovered that rusting a wire decreases the electrical effect produced by its vibration more than can be attributed to the increase in resistance due to the decrease in cross-sectional area. This research also led to the discovery of a wider field of research involving the use of metal rings and larger masses of metal.
