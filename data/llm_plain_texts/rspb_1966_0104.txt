tldr: The author describes the creation and study of hybrid cells from mouse and human cells using a killed virus. These hybrid cells contain nuclei from both species and can synthesize proteins, DNA, and undergo mitosis. The research offers new possibilities for studying nucleo-cytoplasmic relationships and genetic regulation. The author also discusses the potential for further research and the compatibility of cells from different vertebrate species.
