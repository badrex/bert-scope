tldr: 'The authors conducted ultrasonic measurements on carbon disulfide to study its second viscosity. They found a dispersion in the liquid centered around 75 Mc/s at 25°C and 31 Mc/s at -63°C, attributed to the relaxation of total vibrational specific heat. The calculations of absorption per wavelength agreed with the measurements, considering the correction terms due to the higher frequency dispersion. The study reconciles the Navier-Stokes equations and the thermodynamic theory of relaxation, considering the liquid as a limiting case of an elastic body with after-effects.'
