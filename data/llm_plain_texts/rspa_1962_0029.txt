tldr: This article discusses the progress and needs of marine science in the geology of the Western Approaches of the English Channel. The authors conducted several cruises to study the geological sequences and structures in the area, focusing on the origin of the continental slope and shelf. They used various techniques, such as thumper and sparker, to gather data and create a provisional geological map of the region. The authors also describe the various rock formations and stratigraphic divisions found in the area, including Devonian beds, phonolitic masses, metamorphic rocks, and Jurassic, Cretaceous, and Palaeogene deposits.
