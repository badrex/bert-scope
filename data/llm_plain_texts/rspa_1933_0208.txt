tldr: The author investigates the red lines of neon and their suitability as secondary standards for wavelength measurements. They find that the neon lines are accurate and suitable for use as secondary standards when observed with high resolving power interferometers. The author also discusses the effects of using interferometers of low resolving power and provides corrections for their use as standards.
