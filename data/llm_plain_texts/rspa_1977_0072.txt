tldr: The authors studied the diffusion of charge carriers in high electric fields using the Boltzmann equation and incorporating the effect of the carrier density gradient on the distribution function. They found that the diffusion constant of electrons in high electric fields is less than unity and differs from values calculated based on modified Einstein's relations. The method was applied to study hot-electron diffusion in semiconductors, such as germanium and silicon, and showed satisfactory agreement with recent experiments in the case of silicon.
