tldr: The author presents a numerical method for calculating unsteady two-dimensional laminar and turbulent boundary layers with fluctuations in external velocity. The method uses an eddy-viscosity formulation to model the Reynolds shear stress term and an efficient two-point finite-difference method to solve the governing boundary-layer equations. The results are compared with previous solutions and experimental data, showing good agreement and providing insights into the behavior of unsteady boundary layers.
