tldr: The author presents research on the stability of the solar system and the precession of the equinoxes. They develop equations to describe the motion of planets and the effects of a resisting medium on the solar system. The study shows that the solar system remains stable, with the pole of the axis of rotation maintaining a nearly constant geographical latitude, and the angular velocity of rotation and obliquity of the ecliptic varying within small limits and periodically.
