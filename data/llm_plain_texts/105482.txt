tldr: 'Alexander Brice observed a comet in the northwest sky and provided detailed information about its appearance, position, and movement. He noted that the comet's tail was visible to the naked eye, and its nucleus could be seen through a telescope. Brice also mentioned that the comet was descending towards the sun and would make a more remarkable appearance after passing the sun. He encouraged others to observe the comet and look out for its future appearance.'
