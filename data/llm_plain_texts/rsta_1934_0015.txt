revised_title: Group Characters and Immanants in Algebra
semantic_tags:

  - Immanants
tldr: The authors explore the concept of immanants, which are mathematical functions that fill the gap between permanents and determinants. They demonstrate how immanants can be used to calculate group characters and provide a new perspective on the relationship between group theory, algebra, and combinatorial analysis.
