tldr: 'The study investigates the functioning of statocysts in Octopus vulgaris and their role in equilibrium and orientation. It shows that octopuses with both statocysts removed have difficulty swimming and maintaining balance, while those with only one statocyst removed can still swim and walk normally. The results suggest that there is another sensory system involved in equilibral responses besides the statocysts and eyes.'
