tldr: 'This article describes a method for measuring and examining ocean waves to determine their amplitude and period with precision. By comparing data from wave recordings with meteorological charts, the authors assess the velocity of propagation of swell over long distances. They discuss three examples of swell originating from storms in the North Atlantic, off the coast of Florida, and off Cape Horn, and analyze the wave spectra and propagation diagrams to test the validity of hydrodynamical theory.'
