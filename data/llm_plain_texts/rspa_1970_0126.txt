tldr: This article presents a general analysis of short-range interactions between electronic systems, focusing on the coupling of two systems in arbitrary electronic states. The interaction energy is expressed as a power series in expectation values of the spin scalar product, considering the effects of non-orthogonality. The authors provide numerical results for two neon atoms and two nitrogen atoms, demonstrating good agreement with the best results available at the time.
