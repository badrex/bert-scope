tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate electron interaction and its effects on scattering in plasmas. They used a well-collimated electron beam to shoot through a charge cloud and observed the scattering on a fluorescent screen. The results showed that the scattering was less than five times the value predicted by theories neglecting simultaneous multiple collisions, indicating that electron interaction cannot account for the observed anomalies in low-pressure gas discharges or electronic devices.
