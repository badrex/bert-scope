tldr: The author, John Ranby, investigates the existence of an excretory duct from the glandula renalis to the epididymis, as claimed by Valsalva. Despite not finding the duct, Ranby examines the renal artery anatomy and suggests that a branch of the artery might have been mistaken for the duct due to its similar appearance in deceased bodies.
