semantic_tags:
  - Electromagnetic Theory
  - Beltrami-Moses Fields
  - Boundary Value Problem
  - Lorentz-Force
  - Magnetic Stress
tldr: This article provides corrections to a previous paper on statistical energy analysis. It discusses an initial boundary value problem involving Beltrami-Moses fields in electromagnetic theory and includes corrections to equations and a missing reference.
