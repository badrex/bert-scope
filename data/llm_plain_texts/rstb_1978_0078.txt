tldr: This article discusses the challenges and issues in the taxonomy and nomenclature of bivalve molluscs, including the overuse of names for species and higher categorical ranks, leading to confusion and obfuscation in the field. The author suggests that a more phyletically meaningful and simplified classification system is needed, potentially using a cladistic analysis to identify relationships between families and species.
