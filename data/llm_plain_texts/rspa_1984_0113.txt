tldr: The authors conducted a series of experiments on pentadecanoic acid monolayers at 25Â°C using various surface manometry techniques. They aimed to establish a set of surface pressures for the three monolayer phase transitions to act as surface manometric standards. The study demonstrated that the liquid-expanded-liquid-condensed transition is simply first order, and provided a detailed analysis of the experimental requirements for reproducible surface manometry.
