tldr: This article presents specific heat, magnetic susceptibility, and magnetic moment measurements on gadolinium ortho-aluminate, a compound that undergoes a transition to antiferromagnetism at low temperatures. The authors discuss the crystal structure, exchange and anisotropy forces, and compare the measured properties with theoretical predictions for a simple two-sublattice antiferromagnet. Their findings contribute to the understanding of magnetic properties and the behavior of antiferromagnetic materials.
