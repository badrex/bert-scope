tldr: This study investigates the creep behavior of discontinuous fiber composites, specifically lead-phosphor bronze composites. The authors describe the fabrication process and mechanical testing of these composites, and analyze the results to understand the relationship between creep rate, stress, and fiber volume fraction. The findings provide insights into the behavior of these composites and help develop better understanding of their properties.
