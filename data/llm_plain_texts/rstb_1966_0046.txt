tldr: This article discusses the need for interdisciplinary collaboration between anthropologists and ethologists to study ritualization in both animals and humans. The author suggests that by examining concrete data on stereotyped and patterned behaviors, better communication and understanding can be achieved. Topics of mutual interest include the evolution of behavior patterns, the relationship between human speech and animal vocalizations, and the social and ecological contexts of vocalizations. The author also highlights the potential adaptive advantages of cultural symbols and artifacts in human ritual behavior.
