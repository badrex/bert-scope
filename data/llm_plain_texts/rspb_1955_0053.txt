tldr: The authors conducted experiments on Lupinus albus seedlings to study the role of the growing-point in leaf primordia formation. They discovered that the growing-point inhibits the determination of leaf primordia until a certain minimum area is available on the apical cone. This research helps explain the need for a minimum area for leaf determination and how the size of this area is regulated.
