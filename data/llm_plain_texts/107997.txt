tldr: The author, Thomas Graham, conducted research on arsenates, phosphates, and various forms of phosphoric acid. He discovered new subsesquisalts, which are salts containing one and a half proportions of base to one of acid, and studied their properties and crystal structures. This research expanded the understanding of these interesting salts and their interactions with other chemicals.
