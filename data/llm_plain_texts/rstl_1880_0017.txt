tldr: The author describes a method to map the least refrangible end of the solar spectrum using a photographic technique. They discovered that by dyeing collodion films containing silver bromide and exposing them to the solar spectrum, they could create density curves that represented the absorption of different wavelengths. This method allowed for better understanding of the solar spectrum and the potential for further research in spectroscopy.
