tldr: The author, J.L.W. Thudichum, discovered a yellow crystallizable substance called "luteine" in various parts of animals and plants. Luteine is soluble in alcohol, ether, and chloroform but insoluble in water. It has a unique spectrum with three absorption bands in the blue, indigo, and violet part of the spectrum. Luteine is found in the corpora lutea of mammals, ovarian cysts, blood serum, egg yolks, and many plants. The discovery of luteine may lead to a revision of current doctrines regarding the corpus luteum and its relation to egg yolks.
