tldr: The authors conducted diffusion measurements to determine the size of paraffin-chain salt micelles in aqueous solutions. They found that micelles have a large optimum size, and their size remains fairly constant regardless of concentration. The study provides a direct measure of micelle size, which is essential for understanding their behavior and properties in colloidal systems.
