tldr: This article presents a study on the electric conductivity of nitric acid with varying concentrations. The authors discuss the methods used to purify the acid and the effects of impurities on the results. They also examine the specific resistance and temperature coefficients of the acid, finding that it behaves as a metallic conductor at high concentrations. The study provides evidence for the existence of definite combinations of nitric acid with water, supporting the hydrate theory of solution.
