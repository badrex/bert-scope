tldr: The study investigates the ciliary band innervation and organization in the bipinnaria larva of Pisaster ochraceus. It identifies three nerve cell types within the band: sensory cells, bipolar cells, and multipolar cells. The study also examines the larval behavior and the role of cholinergic and catecholamine-containing cells in controlling ciliary beat. The findings support the theory that the bipinnaria larva could provide insights into the evolution of chordates.
