tldr: The article investigates the localization and characteristics of a salt-activated inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate 3-phosphatase at the inner surface of the human erythrocyte membrane. The enzyme is active at the same site as a specific 5-phosphatase that degrades both Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. The study aims to clarify the physiological role of the 3-phosphatase using the simplest cellular system, human erythrocytes.
