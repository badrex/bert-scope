tldr: The authors calculated one-electron wave functions for the normal electron arrangements of neutral and ionized oxygen atoms using the self-consistent field method. They then used Slater's method to calculate the total energies of various stationary states and compared them to observed ionization energies and energy differences between different terms. This study provides a deeper understanding of oxygen atom's behavior and its ionization processes.
