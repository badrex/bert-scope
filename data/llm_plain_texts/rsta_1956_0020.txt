tldr: This article investigates the flow of cohesionless grains in fluids, focusing on the dynamics of grain flow over a gravity bed. The author develops a stress-equilibrium relation that predicts conditions for saltation and bed rippling, and evaluates the transport rates of bed load and suspended load. The findings are applicable to both wind-blown and water-driven grains, providing a better understanding of grain flow behavior in various environments.
