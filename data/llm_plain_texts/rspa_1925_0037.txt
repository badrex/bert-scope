tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the overvoltage of an electrode in an electrolytic cell. They discovered that the total opposition to the passage of current from the electrode to the electrolyte is made up of two distinct parts: one reversible (true overvoltage) and the other irreversible (transfer resistance). This study helps in understanding the behavior of electrodes and improving the accuracy of overvoltage measurements in electrolytic cells.
