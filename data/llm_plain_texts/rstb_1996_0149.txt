tldr: This study investigates the impact of leaf shape on the feeding preference of insect herbivores, specifically focusing on Capsella and Phyllotreta. The researchers found that adult flea beetles preferred to feed on leaves with more lobed margins, contrary to the hypothesis that highly divided leaves would reduce attack by insect herbivores. The results highlight the complexity of plant-herbivore interactions and the importance of leaf shape in influencing insect feeding preferences.
