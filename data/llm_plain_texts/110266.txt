tldr: Davies Gilbert presents a new table to facilitate the calculations for suspension bridges. This table is an improvement over the previous ones, making it easier to apply to practical investigations. The table consists of five columns, showing the deflections, chain lengths, tensions at the middle and extremities, and angles with the horizon.
