tldr: This lecture reviews the current knowledge about terrestrial phenomena and their fluctuations influenced by the Earth's astronomical environment. It discusses the dating and time-scales of various phenomena, such as geomagnetism, climate, and glaciation, and explores the correlations between them. The lecture also examines astronomical phenomena within the Solar System and the Galaxy that might cause terrestrial effects, including planetesimal impacts and their potential origin in interstellar clouds.
