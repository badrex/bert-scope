tldr: 'This article discusses the importance of light-dark transitions in plants, particularly in relation to photoperiodism and circadian rhythms. It explores how plants perceive these transitions, with a focus on short-day plants and the role of phytochrome in sensing light-dark changes. The article also examines the significance of these transitions in the timing of reproduction and other seasonal events in plants.'
