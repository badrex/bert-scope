tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the condensation of water vapor in the presence of dust-free air. They developed an apparatus called the "cloud chamber" to investigate the process of condensation and supersaturation. The results showed that condensation occurs when moist air is expanded rapidly, and the authors concluded that the presence of dust nuclei is essential for the formation of water droplets. This research has significant implications for understanding meteorological phenomena and atmospheric processes.
