tldr: The study examines the spermatozoa ultrastructure of the deep-sea cephalopod Vampyroteuthis inf emails. The spermatozoa have a simple structure with a spheroidal acrosome, a short fusiform nucleus, two triplet centrioles, a short midpiece, and a tail. These features are compared to other cephalopod spermatozoa, supporting the classification of Vampyromorpha as a separate coleoidean order and suggesting a close link between Vampyromorpha and Octopoda.
