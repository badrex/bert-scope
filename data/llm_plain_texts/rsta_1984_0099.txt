tldr: This article discusses the various many-body effects that contribute to the optical nonlinearities of semiconductors near the band edge. The authors explore band filling, screening, band-gap shrinkage, energy broadening, and excitonic enhancement, and their impact on optical properties such as absorption, refraction, and reflection. They also describe the role of radiative self-energies in determining transition rates and the potential for optical bistability in semiconductor materials.
