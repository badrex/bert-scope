tldr: The authors discuss the importance of integrating spatial knowledge with image-analysis techniques for detecting man-made structures from remotely sensed imagery. They describe three experiments using knowledge-based systems to extract specific features such as roads, buildings, and complex sites like airports and urban environments. The long-term goal is to develop systems that can interact with human cartographers or analysts at a highly symbolic level, maintain a database of previous events, and use expert-level knowledge to predict areas for fruitful analysis and integrate the results into a coherent model.
