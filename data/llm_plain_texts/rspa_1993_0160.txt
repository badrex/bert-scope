tldr: The authors compare three models for the injection of space charge from an electrode into a medium in gases and dielectrics. They examine injection laws where the electric field, charge, or current is specified and calculate the resulting voltage-current characteristics. The study shows that for small electrodes, the bulk field distribution is almost independent of the injection process, and the field-specified and charge-specified models are always stable.
