  - Bandwidth changes
tldr: This article discusses a theory of solvent effects on infra-red spectra, focusing on how molecular energy levels and band-width changes are influenced by the environment. The authors propose a model that considers the solute molecule in a spherical cavity within a dielectric medium, which helps explain frequency shifts and band broadening in liquid solutions. They also explore the role of solvent anisotropy and the importance of dielectric constants in determining frequency shifts and band intensities.
