tldr: The authors conducted spectroscopic observations on lithium and cesium, measuring the wave-lengths and oscillation frequencies of their principal series lines. They used a new method to obtain a steady atmosphere of cesium vapor and discussed the differences in the intensity and separation of the lines in the series. The authors also compared their results with previous measurements and calculations, finding both similarities and discrepancies.
