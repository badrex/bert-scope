tldr: This article presents a collection of observations of the solar eclipse that occurred on February 18, 1736-1737. The observations were made by various astronomers, including Geo. Graham, Edm. Halley, and J. Bevis. The eclipse was annular, meaning that the moon did not completely cover the sun, leaving a ring of sunlight around the moon. The article describes the observations made in Edinburgh and other parts of Scotland, as well as the methods used to determine the time of the eclipse. The annular appearance of the eclipse was a new and entertaining phenomenon for many who witnessed it.
