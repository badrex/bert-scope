tldr: The author presents a new method for measuring the magnetic properties of iron, focusing on the rate of change of an electric current in a circuit containing a magnetizing coil. This method allows for more accurate and easier measurements in cases where the traditional methods are difficult to use. The author also describes the design and capabilities of a large electromagnet used in the experiments.
