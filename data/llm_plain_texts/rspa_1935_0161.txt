tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the spread of heat from a heated wire in a turbulent air stream. They found that the eddy conductivity, which represents the effect of turbulence, is proportional to the distance between the hot wire and the point at which the heat wake's spread is measured. The authors also discovered that the temperature distribution in the wake follows the normal error curve, which indicates that the turbulent flow produced by a grid becomes practically isotropic at some distance behind it.
