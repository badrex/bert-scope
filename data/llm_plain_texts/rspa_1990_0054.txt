tldr: This study investigates the drag of two- and three-dimensional obstacles in a fluid with a stable density gradient. The experiments show that even with large-amplitude downstream and columnar waves, the variation of drag with the parameter K is close to that implied by linear theories. The research also reveals that large, steady, periodic variations in drag occur, which are linked to time-variations in lee and columnar wave amplitudes. The findings have implications for atmospheric motions and the understanding of obstacle drag in stratified flow.
