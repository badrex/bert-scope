tldr: The authors analyzed the crystal structure of air-dried vitamin B12 using X-ray diffraction and found that the large, spherical molecules are arranged in layers in an approximately hexagonally close-packed array. They also identified the positions of water molecules in the crystal structure and discussed the molecular arrangement and disorder in the air-dried crystals. The study provides insights into the structure and properties of vitamin B12, which is essential for various biological processes.
