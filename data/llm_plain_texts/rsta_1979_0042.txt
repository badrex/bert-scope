tldr: The author investigates the magnetoresistance of polycrystalline copper and explains the nearly linear variation of resistance with magnetic field up to very high values. They use the effective medium approximation to analyze the conductivity of the polycrystalline material and demonstrate that the resistance should approach saturation in some experiments. The author also discusses the role of open and extended orbits in the magnetoresistance of polycrystalline materials.
