tldr: The author investigates the molecular constitution of volatile organic bases, specifically focusing on the theories of Berzelius and Liebig. They propose a new theory that organic bases can be derived from ammonia by replacing one, two, or three equivalents of hydrogen, resulting in three classes of organic bases: amidogen, imidogen, and nitrile bases. This research provides a more comprehensive understanding of the nature of organic bases and their chemical properties.
