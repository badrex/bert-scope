tldr: The authors investigated the spectra of trebly-ionised oxygen (O IV) and trebly-ionised nitrogen (N IV) using strongly condensed discharges in vacuum tubes. They identified and classified various terms and lines in the spectra, providing insights into the atomic and plasma physics of these elements. Their findings have implications for understanding the spectra of high-excitation Wolf-Rayet stars.
