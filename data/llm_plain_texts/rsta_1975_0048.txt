tldr: The authors conducted a geological survey of the central and eastern parts of the English Channel, discovering a large flat-floored Tertiary syncline that extends the Hampshire Basin to the south-east. They found that the newly defined Hampshire-Dieppe Basin is part of the well-known Palaeogene Anglo-Paris-Belgian deposition basin. The study provides insights into the lithologies, microfaunas, and the geological structure of the area, including the paths of faults and fold axes, and a geological map is presented.
