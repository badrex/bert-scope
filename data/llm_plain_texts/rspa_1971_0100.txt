tldr: This article discusses the general convergence and stability theory for finite-difference approximations to fluid flow problems. The author outlines the methods of analysis, including Fourier analysis and the energy method, and applies them to a typical problem. The behavior of common difference schemes under practical conditions is analyzed, and the leapfrog method emerges as the most suitable basic method when used with appropriate safeguards.
