tldr: The article investigates the fine structure and morphological organization of non-myelinated nerve fibers using electron microscopy. It reveals that several non-myelinated fibers share the cytoplasm of a single Schwann cell and form a syncytium. The study also shows the relationship between nerve fibers and Schwann cells in developing peripheral nerves, providing insights into nerve fiber development and possible physiological importance.
