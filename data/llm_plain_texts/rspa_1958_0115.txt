tldr: This study investigates the minimum energy required to ignite seven solid explosives, including trinitrotoluene (TNT), tetryl, trinitramine, pentaerythritol trinitrate (PETN), blasting gelatin, lead azide, and lead styphnate. The authors developed a compression apparatus to generate hot gas and determine ignition energies. They found that the energy requirements varied among the explosives, with TNT requiring the highest energy and lead styphnate the lowest. The study helps to understand the sensitivity of explosives and improve safety measures.
