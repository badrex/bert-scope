tldr: The authors investigated the electronic structure and stability of inorganic cyanamides, including sodium, thallium, silver, and lead salts. They studied their optical and electrical properties to determine the nature of the bonds in these compounds. The results showed that while sodium cyanamide is an ionic solid, silver and lead cyanamides are covalent, and thallium cyanamide is likely a covalent solid at room temperature. The authors also found that ionizing radiation can introduce color centers into sodium cyanamide, but only minor effects are observed with other solids.
