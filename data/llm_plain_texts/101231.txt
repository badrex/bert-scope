tldr: Mr. Hook conducted experiments to study the role of respiration in animal life. He discovered that the motion of the lungs is not necessary for life, but the supply of fresh air is crucial. His experiments showed that animals can survive with their lungs still, as long as they receive a constant supply of fresh air. This discovery challenged the prevailing belief that the motion of the lungs was essential for life due to its promotion of blood circulation.
