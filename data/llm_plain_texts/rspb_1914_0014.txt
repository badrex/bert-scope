tldr: This study investigates the relationship between heat production and muscular work in individuals performing a constant amount of mechanical work. The authors find that heat production can be expressed graphically and through a simple formula, H = H0 + X * W, where H is the heat produced, W is the work done, H0 and X are constants related to the individual's weight and body processes. The results show that the heat generated by a person's body without doing external work is equal to the difference between 4.5 times their weight and a constant.
