tldr: The author investigates the effects of magnetic fields on luminous glows in exhausted gases, specifically focusing on oxygen, hydrogen, neon, and air. They observe that the glow is deflected and its intensity is affected by the magnetic field, with different results depending on the type of residual gas. This research sheds light on the behavior of moving static induction of electricity in the presence of a magnetic field.
