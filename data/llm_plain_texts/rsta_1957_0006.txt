tldr: This study investigates the mechanism behind the secular variation and the non-dipole part of the Earth's magnetic field. The authors explore the eddy hypothesis, which suggests that these phenomena could be due to induction caused by the interaction of the Earth's main magnetic field with eddies in the fluid core. They develop a model in which a rigid eddy spins steadily in a rigid conducting core and discuss the induced magnetic fields resulting from different configurations of the eddy, the surrounding conductor, and the applied magnetic field.
