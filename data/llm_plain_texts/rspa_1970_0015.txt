tldr: The authors explore the global isometric embedding of pseudo-Riemannian manifolds, demonstrating that any such manifold can be embedded into a pseudo-Euclidean space. They also provide a new proof using a Euclidean space of lower dimension and apply the result to the space-time of relativity.
