tldr: This article presents a mathematical theory of magnetism without assuming the existence of hypothetical magnetic fluids. The author develops a general theory of magnets and discusses magnetic induction, providing a comprehensive analysis of magnetic force, distribution, and the resulting actions between magnets. The study also introduces solenoidal and lamellar distributions and offers four methods for analyzing the action of a magnet.
