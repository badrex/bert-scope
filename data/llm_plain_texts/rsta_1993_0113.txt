tldr: The authors present a semi-quantitative description of a bimolecular association in aqueous solution by dividing the free energy of binding into various terms representing costs and benefits. They use this approach to study the binding of cell-wall analogues to vancomycin group antibiotics and provide insights into the factors determining the binding constant. The study also explores the relation between the exothermicity of weak associations in non-polar solutions and the adverse entropy of the association.
