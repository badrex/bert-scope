tldr: 'The author, Mr. Ludlam, observed and recorded the solar eclipse of June 24, 1778, in Leicester. He provided details on the time of the eclipse, the weather conditions, and the zenith distances of the Sun. The Astronomer Royal communicated Ludlam's observations, which were used to calculate the difference between the meridians of Greenwich and Leicester. This information helped to improve the accuracy of time measurement and geographical location.'
