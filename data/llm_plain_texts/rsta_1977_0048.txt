tldr: The author analyzes the chemical and isotopic characteristics of lunar soils and finds that the exotic component, present in all lunar soils, is likely sourced from the Imbrium-Procellarum region. This component is not indicative of a global radioactive crust on the Moon, but rather a regional source of trace element-enriched materials. The author suggests that surficial transport processes distribute these materials widely over the lunar surface.
