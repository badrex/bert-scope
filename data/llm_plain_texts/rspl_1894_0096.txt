  - Surface tension
tldr: This article investigates the molecular surface-energy of mixtures of non-associating liquids, such as toluene and piperidine, benzene and carbon tetrachloride, and other substances. The experiments show that while the height and surface tension of the mixtures are not necessarily the mean of the individual liquids, the coefficient of decrease of molecular surface-energy and calculated molecular weights are true means of the two liquids. The findings provide insight into the behavior of different liquid mixtures and their properties.
