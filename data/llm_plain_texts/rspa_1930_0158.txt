tldr: The authors conducted a spectrographic examination of the cathodic combustion of carbonic oxide and found that carbonic oxide molecules are excited but not ionized. They also discovered that metals are sputtered as atoms and that oxygen atoms are formed in the cathode zone. This study provides insights into the mechanism of the cathodic combustion of "detonating gas."
