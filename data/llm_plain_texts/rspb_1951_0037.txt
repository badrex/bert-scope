tldr: This study investigates the effect of peptic digestion on diphtheria antitoxin properties, specifically its ability to pass through the placenta and its sensitization potential. The research shows that diphtheria antitoxin prepared in a guinea pig passes easily to the offspring, while the same antitoxin prepared in a horse and subjected to peptic digestion does not. The study also demonstrates that peptic-digested antitoxin loses its ability to cause passive anaphylactic sensitization.
