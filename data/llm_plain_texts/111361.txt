tldr: The author investigates the optical characters of alkaloids associated with quinine and their iodo-compounds. They discover that quinidin and cinchonidin have different optical properties, and they study the crystal structures and compositions of their iodo-sulfates. The author also discusses the potential applications of these findings in the field of crystallography.
