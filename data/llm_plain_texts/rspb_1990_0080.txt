tldr: The author investigates the osmotic coupling and chloride transport in Limonium salt glands, finding that the secreted fluid is nearly isotonic with the basal medium and that chloride contributes half of the total osmolarity of the exudate. The study provides evidence for the incorporation of the transport complex into the gland cells' plasmalemma during the induction process.
