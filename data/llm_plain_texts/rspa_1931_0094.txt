tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the electrical condition of hot carbon and copper surfaces during the adsorption of gases. They found that the "normalization" of the surfaces, in terms of constant and reproducible surface potentials, depended on the removal of occluded gases and structural changes in the surface. The carbon surface showed a positive surface potential when in contact with oxygen, while the copper surface did not exhibit a surface potential when in contact with oxygen, suggesting that copper does not adsorb oxygen in a manner similar to carbon.
