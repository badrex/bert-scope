tldr: The author, Matthew Flinders, observed differences in the direction of a magnetic needle on board the Investigator due to alterations in the ship's direction. He found that these differences were more significant in higher latitudes and were nearly proportional to the number of points the ship's head was from north or south. Flinders also proposed a hypothesis that the attractive power of a ship's ironwork creates a focal point affecting the compass, causing the differences in the magnetic needle's direction.
