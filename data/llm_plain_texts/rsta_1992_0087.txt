tldr: This article reviews and compares various emission mechanisms for pulsar radio emission from a plasma-physical perspective. The authors discuss emission by bunches, reactive instabilities, and maser mechanisms, and then explore direct and indirect processes, such as curvature, cyclotron, and linear acceleration emissions, as well as relativistic plasma emission processes. They conclude that relativistic plasma emission is the most plausible mechanism, but other mechanisms cannot be ruled out.
