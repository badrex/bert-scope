tldr: The author conducted a series of measurements in high latitudes to study the radioactivity in the atmosphere. They found that the radioactivity was significantly higher than in lower latitudes, with the highest values occurring in the evening. The author also discovered that the amount of cloud cover had a significant influence on the radioactivity, while temperature and barometric pressure had little effect. There was no clear connection between the aurora and radioactivity during the observations.
