tldr: The author, John Davy, responds to Dr. Daubeny's objections regarding the origin of air disengaged from the sea over a sunken volcano. Davy argues that the air comes from the sea water, rather than a deep volcanic source, and explains the chemical reactions and processes involved in the expulsion of air from the water. He also discusses the temperature and pressure conditions necessary for these reactions to occur.
