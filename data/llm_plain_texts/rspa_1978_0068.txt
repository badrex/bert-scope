tldr: The author investigates general theorems related to wave propagation governed by self-adjoint and Hermitian self-adjoint differential operators of order 2r. They develop a theory that applies to various physical models, including fourth-order linear differential equations in the theory of electromagnetic waves in an ionosphere and isotropic gyrotational media. The study provides a deeper understanding of wave processes and the underlying mathematical structure.
