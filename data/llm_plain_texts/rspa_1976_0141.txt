revised_title: Isotope Shifts and Hyperfine Structure in the Atomic Spectrum of Palladium

tldr: The authors studied the isotope shifts and hyperfine structure in the atomic spectrum of palladium using high-resolution digital recording interferometry. They measured the even-even shifts and found the relative shifts between isotopes. The results provided values for the change in the mean square radius of the nuclear charge distribution, which helped in understanding the nuclear properties of palladium isotopes.
