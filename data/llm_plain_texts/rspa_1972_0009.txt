tldr: The authors calculate the change in the radiative correction to the magnetic moment of a free electron when it is placed between infinite, parallel, perfectly conducting plates. They use a fully relativistic calculation to determine the effect of an external magnetic field on the electron's magnetic moment. This study provides a relativistic confirmation of the leading spin-independent energy shifts for a free electron.
