tldr: This study reports measurements of dimensional changes and principal thermal expansion coefficients in various grades of pyrolytic graphite after fast-neutron irradiation. The results provide insights into the behavior of graphite monocrystals under irradiation conditions and help in understanding the accumulation of irradiation damage in fast-neutron-irradiated graphite. The findings contribute to the interpretation of dimensional changes in polycrystalline aggregates.
