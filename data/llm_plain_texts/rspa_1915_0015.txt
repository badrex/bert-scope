tldr: The author, P. De Lange and Lord Rayleigh, describe their invention of a new thermophone technology. They explain how their design, which involves a platinum wire in a gothic curve, eliminates the need for a diaphragm and makes the thermophone practical for everyday use. They also discuss the acoustic effects and potential applications of their invention, such as combining multiple thermophones and using them in telecommunication systems.
