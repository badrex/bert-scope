tldr: The author investigates the production of induced currents in liquids through magneto-electric induction, examining three cases: a liquid stream flowing in a magnetic field, a liquid rotating over a magnetic pole, and a liquid at rest in a variable magnetic field. The study also discusses the potential impact of magneto-electric currents in ocean currents and the limitations of detecting them.
