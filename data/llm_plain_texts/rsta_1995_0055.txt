tldr: This article investigates the effect of matrix cracking on the overall thermal conductivity of fiber-reinforced composites. The authors model a cracked composite using a cylindrical cell and analyze the heat transfer mechanisms across matrix cracks and debonded portions of the fiber-matrix interface. They find that matrix cracking and interfacial debonding can significantly reduce the longitudinal thermal conductivity, affecting other thermo-mechanical properties of the composite. The study focuses on composites with transversely isotropic fibers in an isotropic matrix, where the matrix has a larger thermal expansion coefficient than the fibers.
