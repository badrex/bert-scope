revised_title: The Action of Solid Nuclei on Supersaturated Solutions
semantic_tags:
  - Nucleation
  - Supersaturated solutions
  - Porous materials
  - Atmospheric conditions
  - Chemical reactions
tldr: The author investigates the effect of solid nuclei, such as pumice and plaster of Paris, on supersaturated solutions. They find that these nuclei can cause the solutions to solidify, and that their activity is influenced by atmospheric conditions, particularly wind direction. The author also discusses the role of heat in activating or deactivating these nuclei.
