tldr: This study examines the diet of the beewolf Philanthus sanbornii, a predator that hunts a wide range of flower-visiting bees and wasps. The research analyzes the prey taken by the beewolf and compares it to a crude but independent estimate of the potential prey available. The findings show that the beewolf takes most species of bees and wasps in proportion to their abundances at flowers, with some species underutilized. The study suggests that hunting females develop temporary fidelities to particular sites but not to specific prey taxa, and that the risk of predation is roughly proportional to the time spent at flowers.
