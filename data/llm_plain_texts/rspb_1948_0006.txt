tldr: The author investigates the presence and fluctuation of haemoglobin in different species of Daphnia, a type of water flea. Haemoglobin is found in the blood and eggs of these crustaceans, and its quantity varies greatly depending on factors such as oxygen levels and nutrition. The author also explores the potential role of haemoglobin in parthenogenetic development and its function in Daphnia.
