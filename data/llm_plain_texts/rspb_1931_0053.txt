revised_title: 'Mediterranean Kala Azar Sandflies: Species Identification and Bionomics'
semantic_tags:
  - Sandflies
  - Kala Azar
  - Bionomics
  - Species identification
  - Disease transmission
tldr: The authors investigate the sandflies of the Mediterranean basin, focusing on their bionomics and distribution. They describe the identification methods for various sandfly species, emphasizing the importance of distinguishing between them due to their differing capacities to transmit disease. The study also discusses the differences in bionomics and armature between the Minutus group and the erect-haired group of sandflies.
