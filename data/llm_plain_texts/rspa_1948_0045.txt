tldr: The authors develop a theory for the yielding and plastic flow of anisotropic metals, which takes into account the preferred orientation of crystal planes and directions in the metal. They propose a plastic potential function and apply it to experiments on metal strips cut from rolled sheet, predicting the elongation of the cups drawn from the sheet. The theory provides a better understanding of the macroscopic behavior of anisotropic metals and can help improve metalworking processes.
