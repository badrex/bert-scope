tldr: This study examines the spatial and temporal distribution of phenotypes in a colony of the land snail Cepaea nemoralis. The authors collected samples in 1924 and 1961 from the same locations in Bundoran, Ireland, to compare the state of the populations. The results show a state of apparent evolutionary stability, with no consistent evolutionary changes observed over the 37-year period. The study provides valuable information about the role of natural selection in microevolutionary change.
