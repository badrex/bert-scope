revised_title: Quaternions in Wave-Tensor Calculus: Applications and Extensions
semantic_tags:
  - Wave mechanics
  - Tensor calculus
  - Quaternions
  - Quantum mechanics
  - Mathematical physics
tldr: The authors explore the use of quaternions in wave-tensor calculus, demonstrating their connection to -numbers and their applications in wave mechanics. They derive Eddington's simple wave equation and discuss its solutions, as well as applying the theory to establish Dirac's equations using a modified version of Eddington's method.
