tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the formation of pressure crack-figures on diamond faces, specifically the octahedral face. They discovered that applying pressure with a diamond ball creates oriented hexagonal-shaped ring cracks. The development of these figures was studied using increasing loads, revealing concentric multiple cracks and permanent surface distortions. Interferometry techniques were used to analyze the orientation and characteristics of the pressure marks and the accompanying surface distortions.
