tldr: The authors developed a sensitive water-level tiltmeter to measure changes in Earth's crust strain, overcoming the limitations of horizontal pendulum tiltmeters. The new tiltmeter was tested in an underground site near Ottawa, showing promising results for monitoring Earth tides and secular tilting due to reservoir loading. The tiltmeter's sensitivity is comparable to a short-based tiltmeter, and further improvements, such as using a low-vapor pressure, low-viscosity fluid, could enhance its performance.
