tldr: This paper describes 18 well-preserved Cretaceous plants from Northern Japan, providing valuable insights into the anatomy and affinities of ancient flora. The authors found a mix of angiosperms, gymnosperms, ferns, and lower plants, with some specimens being the first of their kind to be described. This study serves as a foundation for further research on the Mesozoic period's plant life.
