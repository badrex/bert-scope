tldr: The author presents a method to solve the regular and asymptotic characteristic initial value problem for Einstein's vacuum field equations using the spin-frame formalism. This approach reduces the problem to a simpler characteristic initial value problem for a symmetric hyperbolic system of differential equations, allowing for the investigation of non-stationary solutions that are asymptotically flat in the infinite past.
