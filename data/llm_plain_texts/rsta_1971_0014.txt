tldr: This article discusses the petrology of metamorphic rocks found on the ocean floor, specifically in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The authors describe the occurrence and modes of metamorphism of metabasalts and metagabbros, which were formed by burial metamorphism in the deeper parts of the Earth's crust and upper mantle. The study also highlights the role of ocean-floor spreading and the movement of tectonic plates in the formation and distribution of these metamorphic rocks.
