tldr: The author's experiments confirmed the existence of two types of cosmic rays: absorbable rays assumed to behave like electrons and a more penetrating group attributed to heavier particles. The study found that the energy loss of the majority of rays varies rapidly with energy, suggesting that they are not normal electrons. The results support the cascade theory, which explains the behavior of cosmic rays at sea level, and provide evidence for the presence of a few fully radiating electrons and a large number of highly penetrating particles.
