tldr: The author investigates the stratifications in electrical discharges in various vacua, including Torricellian and other rarefied media. They observe that the cloud-like stratifications depend on the perfection of the vacuum and the absence of moisture. The author also studies the effects of different gases on the discharge's appearance and behavior, such as hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. They describe the white-tongue and blue-tongue discharges, which are influenced by magnets.
