tldr: The authors, Ramsay and Travers, discuss the discovery and properties of argon and other noble gases, including krypton, neon, and xenon. They describe their methods for separating and analyzing these gases, as well as their densities, refractivities, molecular volumes, compressibilities, and vapor pressures. The authors also discuss the liquefaction of air and the apparatus used for fractionating the gases.
