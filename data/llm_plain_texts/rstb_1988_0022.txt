tldr: 'This article examines the sedimentary record of climatic changes in the southern North Sea over the past three million years. It discusses how the region's sedimentary sequence records both direct and indirect responses to climate change, including moraine and glaciofluvial deposits from various glacial periods and sea-level changes. The study provides insights into the interaction of sedimentary processes and the palaeogeographic development of the region in response to climatic changes.'
