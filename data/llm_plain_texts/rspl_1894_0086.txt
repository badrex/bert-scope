tldr: The author investigates rapid variations of atmospheric temperature, particularly during the Fohn phenomenon, which is a warm wind blowing from the mountains towards the plain. The Fohn occurs in various locations, including the Alps and Scotland, and is characterized by rapid temperature oscillations and high average temperatures. The author also observes the temperature gradient between melting ice surfaces and hot winds, which presents interesting findings for further research.
