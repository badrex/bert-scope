tldr: This article presents an investigation of the double refraction of quartz along the optic axis. The author uses a specially cut quartz prism and two methods to determine the position of the optic axis. The results show that the angular separation of the images is consistent with the Fresnel's theory of rotatory polarization. This study provides a better understanding of the properties of quartz and its applications in optics.
