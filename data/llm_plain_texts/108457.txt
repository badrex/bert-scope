tldr: The author, Henry Bence Jones, conducted experiments to determine the variations of sulphates and phosphates in urine during different diseases. The study found that in acute chorea, the amount of sulphates in the urine is increased, while phosphates can be remarkably diminished. In acute inflammatory diseases of the nervous structures, both sulphates and total phosphates in the urine are increased. The research also showed that muscular action and inflammation of the brain have different effects on the levels of sulphates and phosphates in the urine.
