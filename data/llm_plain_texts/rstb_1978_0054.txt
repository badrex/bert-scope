tldr: This study examines the macrofauna inhabiting the intertidal sand flats on low wooded islands in the Northern Great Barrier Reef. The research identifies three main sediment-fauna types: well-sorted sands, muddy sand flats, and areas of fine deposits. The findings provide valuable information on the composition of communities living in the intertidal zone, contributing to the understanding of the marine fauna in the Great Barrier Reef Province.
