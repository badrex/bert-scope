tldr: This article investigates the passage of fast particles through gases using the Wilson cloud chamber method. The authors study primary ionization, the frequency of production of "branch" tracks, and the momentum relations in branch collisions. Their findings provide insights into the loss of energy by fast particles and help distinguish between nuclear and electron scattering.
