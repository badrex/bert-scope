tldr: 'The authors discovered microsporangia in organic connection with the foliage of Lyginodendron Oldhamium, a plant from the Carboniferous period. This finding provides new insights into the reproductive structures of ancient plants and their evolution. The authors also describe the structure and features of the microsporangia and the process of dehiscence.'
