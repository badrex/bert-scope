tldr: The authors developed a series of substituted indoxyl acetates for use as model chromogenic substrates for esterases in enzyme cytochemistry. They synthesized these substrates through a unified procedure and tested their performance in cytochemical staining methods. The study aimed to improve the precision of enzyme localization and develop better staining methods for cellular enzymes.
