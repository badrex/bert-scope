tldr: This article describes a violent hurricane that hit Huntingtonshire in 1741. The author, Stephen Fuller, provides a detailed account of the storm's impact, including the damage it caused, the duration, and the path it took. The hurricane was so powerful that it blew down houses, barns, and mills, and killed one person. The storm was followed by a period of calm before the wind picked up again later in the day.
