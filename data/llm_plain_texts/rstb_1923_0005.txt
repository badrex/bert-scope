tldr: The author examines five skulls of foetal whales, three of Megaptera and two of Balaenoptera, to study their skull development and morphology. The investigation provides insights into the growth and development of the skulls of these cetaceans, connecting the published accounts of the primordial cranium with those of the adult skull of the Humpback whale.
