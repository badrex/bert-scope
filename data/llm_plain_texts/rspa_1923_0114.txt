tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments on carbon dioxide at various pressures and temperatures to study the molecular scattering of light. They used sealed glass bulbs and a custom-built apparatus to measure the scattering power and depolarization of light in different states of carbon dioxide. The results supported the Einstein-Smoluchowski theory of scattering and provided insights into the behavior of light scattering in gases and liquids.'
