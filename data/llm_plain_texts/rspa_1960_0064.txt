tldr: This study investigates the mechanical behavior and deformation of single-crystal gold films of high strength using an electron microscope. The films, with thicknesses between 500 to 2000 Angstroms, were prepared using an evaporation technique. The results show that the films exhibit elastic deformation up to abnormally high strain values, with tensile strengths several times greater than hard-drawn gold wire. The high tensile strength occurs despite the presence of a high density of dislocations. Detailed examination of the fractured specimens reveals that localized plastic deformation occurs immediately before fracture, leading to a catastrophic failure due to high stress levels and stress concentrations from localized thinning.
