tldr: 'In this article, John Robertson conducts experiments to determine the specific gravity of living men. He creates a large water-filled cistern and measures the rise in water level when each participant submerges themselves. The results show that most men are lighter than their equal volume of fresh water, which could potentially help save people from drowning if they can remain calm and avoid panic. Robertson also suggests improvements for future experiments and discusses a real-life example of a young scholar who managed to save himself from drowning by staying calm and following his instincts.'
