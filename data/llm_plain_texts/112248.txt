tldr: In this letter, William Lassell describes his observations of a planetary nebula in Malta using a large equatoreal telescope. He discovered a brilliant elliptic ring within the nebula, which was well-defined and appeared to have no connection with the surrounding gaseous envelope. Lassell's observations suggest that the ring might be either elliptic or circular, and he compares it to the annular nebula in Lyra. The discovery of this remarkable object raises the possibility of more magnificent systems existing beyond our current view of the universe.
