tldr: 'The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, established by Princess Augusta, has a rich history of plant research and classification. Serving as a pioneer in collecting plants for their own sake, Kew Gardens has grown to become the largest botanical collection of living plants in the world. The gardens have been closely associated with the Royal Society, with four of its eight directors serving as officers of the society. Kew Gardens now houses a herbarium with over five million specimens, a library, museums, the Jodrell Laboratory, and living collections, making it an essential resource for botanical research and international collaboration.'
