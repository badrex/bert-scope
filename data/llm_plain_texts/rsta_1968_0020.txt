tldr: This study investigates the factors affecting people's response to noise in office environments. Researchers found that noise acceptability is influenced by both average noise levels and the rate of transient peaks above that level. They developed a method to predict noise acceptability based on these factors, which can help improve noise control in offices and enhance workers' comfort and satisfaction.
