tldr: This article presents a general theory of elastic stability, discussing the conditions for equilibrium and the methods used to investigate the stability of elastic systems. The author compares and contrasts various approaches, such as the energy method, the method of vibrations, and the statical method, to provide a comprehensive understanding of elastic stability. The article also explores the practical applications of the theory, including the stability of struts and shells under various loads.
