tldr: The authors conducted experiments to find a treatment for trypanosomiasis in rats. They tested various substances, including atoxyl, which temporarily eliminated trypanosomes from the blood but did not cure the disease. They also tested other compounds like arsenic derivatives, but none provided a permanent solution. The authors found that atoxyl was the most effective substance, but it needed to be combined with other treatments to achieve better results. They discovered that some trypanosomes could resist atoxyl, leading to recurring infections. Further research is needed to find a more effective treatment for trypanosomiasis.
