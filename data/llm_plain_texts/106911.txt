tldr: This article describes an experiment conducted by Isaac Humfries and Thomas B. Woodman, who discovered that linseed oil can spontaneously ignite when in contact with certain materials, such as coarse cotton cloth. They found that rats may have knocked over a bottle of linseed oil, causing it to spill onto the cloth and ignite, leading to concerns of arson at an arsenal.
