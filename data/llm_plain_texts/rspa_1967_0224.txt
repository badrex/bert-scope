tldr: The authors conducted a comparative study of various methods to calculate nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spin-spin coupling constants in ethylene. They found that semi-empirical methods were inadequate and that a self-consistent-field calculation with configuration interaction provided good agreement with experimental results. The study highlights the importance of considering electron correlation in accurate calculations of spin-spin coupling constants.
