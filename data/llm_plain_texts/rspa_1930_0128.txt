tldr: 'The authors investigated the hyper-fine structure of the arc spectrum of indium to determine if any lines had a quantized nuclear spin and a corresponding magnetic moment. They used a reflecting echelon grating to analyze the spectrum and found that the nucleus must possess one quantum of rotation. The results agreed with Fermi's theory of the interaction of nuclear and electron spins.'
