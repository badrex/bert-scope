tldr: The study investigates the effects of potassium channel blocking agent 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) on regenerating rat nerve fibers. Results show that early regenerating axons experience considerable broadening of the action potential after 4-AP application, while late regenerating axons give rise to burst activity following a single stimulus. These findings demonstrate the importance of potassium conductance in stabilizing firing properties of myelinated regenerating axons.
