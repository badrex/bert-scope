tldr: The author re-examines the shoulder girdle in Ichthyosauria and Sauropterygia, challenging previous statements made by other paleoherpetologists. They argue against the existence of a precoracoid in the Ichthyosaurian shoulder girdle and provide a detailed analysis of the scapula and coracoid bones, concluding that the idea of a tripartite division of the ventral end of the scapula is illusory.
