tldr: This study investigates the uptake of sodium and potassium by bacteria using radioactive tracers. The authors found that during the stationary phase, approximately 97% of the total potassium in the medium is taken up by the bacteria. The potassium is progressively displaced from the cells as the pH is lowered. The cells do not take up any sodium that cannot be replaced by potassium.
