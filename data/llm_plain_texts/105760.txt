tldr: This article discusses the effectiveness of the Quassi Root in treating various types of fevers. Dr. Donald Monro shares a letter from Mr. James Farley, who describes successful treatments using the Quassi Root in Antigua. The root is said to have advantages over traditional bark treatments, as it does not cause heat in patients and can be used in conjunction with other medicines like Radix Serpentariae Virginianae.
