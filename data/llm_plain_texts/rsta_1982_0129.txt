tldr: The article discusses the spectroscopic equipment and capabilities of the Space Telescope, focusing on the Faint Object Spectrograph (F.O.S.) and the High-Resolution Spectrograph (H.R.S.). The Space Telescope will provide clear views of the Universe and operate over the range of 110 nm to 1 mm. The F.O.S. is sensitive from 115 to 800 nm and will provide data at resolving powers on extremely faint sources. The H.R.S. will provide high-resolution spectroscopy for brighter targets. The Space Telescope's bandpass covers four decades in wavelength, from 1100 A to 1 mm, and will allow the resolution and isolation of fine spatial details in extended sources such as galaxies, nebulae, star clusters, and planetary disks.
