tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the electrical condition of hot nickel surfaces when exposed to various gases. They discovered that the surface charge depends on the temperature and the nature of the gas, and found that gases like hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon monoxide significantly affect the surface charge. The results support a hypothesis that explains the charging up of hot surfaces in contact with gases, and can be extended to further investigate the mechanism of heterogeneous catalysis.
