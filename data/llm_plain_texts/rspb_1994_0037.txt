tldr: The study investigates the action of capsaicin on type I delayed rectifier potassium currents in rabbit Schwann cells. Capsaicin was found to block the open channels of these currents, with the block proceeding slowly and producing a characteristic 'inactivation' of the whole-cell current. The results suggest that capsaicin may be a useful tool for probing channel function.
