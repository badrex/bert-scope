tldr: This article investigates the enhancement of heat flux by convection using non-uniform electric fields. The authors found that a strong electric field can increase the heat flux several times, delay the onset of nucleate boiling, and reduce the risk of 'burn-out'. The enhancement is primarily due to dielectrophoresis, but an ion wind may also contribute. The findings have implications for industries such as power transformers and heat transfer problems involving forced convection.
