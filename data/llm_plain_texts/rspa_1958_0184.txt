tldr: The author explores the geometry and symmetry of the Steiner system and the 8-cage, focusing on the connections between duads and synthemes, outer automorphisms, and the 5-regular graph. The study involves the symmetric group of degree six and its properties, as well as the applications of the Steiner system and the 8-cage in various mathematical contexts.
