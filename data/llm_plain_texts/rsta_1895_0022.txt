tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the reaction rate of hydrogen dioxide and hydrogen iodide. They found that the amount of change is directly proportional to the amount of dioxide, iodide, and the total volume of the solution. The authors also investigated the effects of temperature and the presence of other substances on the reaction rate, providing a basis for comparing and classifying these substances.
