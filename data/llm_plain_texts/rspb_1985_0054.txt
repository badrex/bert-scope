tldr: This study investigates the effects of crude oil exposure on the epidermal growth and differentiation of sexually mature male salmon. The results show that exposure to crude oil inhibits epidermal thickening, cellular proliferation, and mucigenesis. The oil-related effects are likely systemic, originating from reduced plasmatic androgen levels. This research provides insights into how teleost skin is affected by crude oil and its potential impact on the environment.
