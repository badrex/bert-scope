tldr: This article is a biography of Lev Davydovitch Landau, a prominent Soviet physicist known for his contributions to theoretical physics. Born in Baku in 1908, Landau studied at the University of Leningrad and later worked at the Physical-Technical Institute in Leningrad and the Institute of Physical Problems in Moscow. He made significant contributions to the fields of quantum mechanics, superconductivity, and theoretical physics, and was a mentor to many students who went on to become notable scientists. Landau's life and career are detailed, including his personal relationships, his teaching methods, and his impact on the development of theoretical physics in the Soviet Union.
