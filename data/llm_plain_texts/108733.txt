tldr: The author, Thomas Graham, discusses the concept of liquid diffusion and its potential for separation techniques. He introduces the idea of colloids and crystalloids, and explains how they can be separated through processes like dialysis. Graham also describes a method of separation using a column of water and a gelatinous septum, which allows for the isolation of substances based on their diffusive power.
