tldr: This study investigates the effects of sloping upper and lower boundaries on baroclinic waves in a differentially heated rotating fluid annulus. Measurements of internal temperature structure, transition from axisymmetric to non-axisymmetric flow, wave numbers and flow types, drift rates, and heat transfer were made. The sloping boundaries influence baroclinic waves in two distinct ways: parallel boundaries affect the energy release mechanism, while non-parallel boundaries introduce effects similar to the latitudinal variation of the Coriolis parameter in a planetary atmosphere. The results provide insights into the role of the beta-effect and large-scale topography in natural systems like the atmosphere and oceans.
