tldr: This article presents experiments on the duration of impacts, specifically on bars with rounded ends, to better understand the elastic theory. The authors used a condenser to measure the time of impact and found that the relationship between time and velocity of the bars is non-linear. The results provide insights into the dynamics of impacts and the role of geometry in the problem.
