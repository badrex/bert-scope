tldr: The article discusses the lunar chronology and basin formation determined from radiometric ages of returned lunar samples. It presents arguments for the formation of major ring-basins and the duration of volcanic processes in Mare Serenitatis, Mare Tranquillitatis, and Mare Imbrium. The study also examines the controversy surrounding the chronology of basin formation and the preponderance of Imbrium ejecta in highland rocks.
