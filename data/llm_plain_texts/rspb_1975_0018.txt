tldr: The article discusses the structural differences between stigmatic papillae and pollen grains in relation to incompatibility in Plumbaginaceae plants. The author found that dimorphic plants have different wall structures in their papillae, which play a role in the incompatibility mechanism. Incompatible pollen grains fail to germinate on the stigmas, while compatible pollen grains successfully germinate and fertilize the plant.
