tldr: The authors studied the catalytic properties and structure of metal films, specifically platinum films, and found a relationship between their catalytic activity and electrical condition. They discovered that the rate of combustion of electrolytic gas on the surface of the platinum films was directly proportional to the rate of electrical charging up of the film. The authors also examined the effect of heat on the films, observing that prolonged heating led to a breakdown of the crystal structure.
