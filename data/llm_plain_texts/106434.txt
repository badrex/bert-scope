tldr: The authors examined various ores, specifically gold pyrites and vitreous silver ore, to determine their composition and properties. They conducted a series of experiments to analyze the ores and discovered that gold in gold pyrites is in its native form, not combined with other elements. In vitreous silver ore, they found no evidence of sulfur, challenging the common belief of its composition. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the nature of these ores and their potential for extraction.
