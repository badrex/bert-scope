tldr: The authors investigate the adsorption of vapors at plane surfaces of mica and develop an apparatus to study the process. They find that multimolecular films form at pressures below saturation, and the adsorption is not affected by the packing method of the mica. The experiments provide evidence that the polymolecular films exist on the cleavage surfaces of the plates and have properties that differentiate them from normal bulk liquids.
