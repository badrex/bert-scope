tldr: This article examines radiative equilibrium in the ionosphere, focusing on the temperature and absorption processes. The authors suggest that molecular oxygen is the primary ultra-violet absorption agent below 250 km, while atomic oxygen is responsible for absorption at greater heights. They also discuss the heat balance in the atmosphere, considering factors such as dissociation of oxygen and the transfer of energy through fluorescence. The study aims to determine the temperature of the atmosphere based on the kinetic energy of its particles.
