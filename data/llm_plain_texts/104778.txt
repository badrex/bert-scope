tldr: The author describes experiments conducted by Mr. l'Allamand on the electrical phenomena and light emission caused by shaking quicksilver (mercury) in a glass tube. The experiments showed that the friction of mercury against the glass electrified the glass, leading to the conclusion that the phosphorus of the barometer is an effect of the mercury electrifying the tube. The author also mentions other related experiments and observations, such as the use of exhausted tubes, electrification causing faster heartbeats, and the potential for sharp pains during electrification.
