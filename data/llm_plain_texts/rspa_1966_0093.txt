tldr: The authors present a study on solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and the rotating-specimen method. They discuss the theory behind the method, which involves rotating solid specimens to remove dipolar broadening and reveal chemically shifted resonances. The authors apply this method to various solid phosphorus compounds, measuring chemical shifts and comparing them to related compounds in liquid states. This research contributes to the understanding of solid-state NMR and its applications in various materials and compounds.
