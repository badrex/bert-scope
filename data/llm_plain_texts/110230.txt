tldr: Edward Sabine conducted experiments to determine the difference in the number of vibrations made by an invariable pendulum at the Royal Observatories of Greenwich and Altona. The results were compared to establish the rate of the pendulum at both locations. The details of the observations are provided in a tabulated form.
