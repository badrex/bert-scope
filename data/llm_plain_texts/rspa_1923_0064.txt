tldr: The authors studied the effects of helium on the band and line spectra of carbon in vacuum tubes. They investigated the conditions under which different spectra can be best experimentally isolated. They discovered new spectra, including the low-pressure CO band spectrum and the comet-tail bands, and analyzed their wave-lengths and intensities.
