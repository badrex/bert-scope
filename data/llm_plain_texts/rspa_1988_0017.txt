tldr: The author explores Weyl's method for solving space-time metrics with two commuting Killing fields, reducing the problem to solving a Laplace or wave equation in two variables and a pair of integrable differential equations. The author applies this method to three physical problems, including generalizing the Schwarzschild solution for static black holes, studying colliding plane gravitational waves, and examining the collision of plane-shock electromagnetic waves supported by impulsive gravitational waves. The paper provides explicit solutions for the remaining equations in each case.
