tldr: This article investigates the effect of thermal agitation on atomic arrangement in alloys, focusing on the transformations between disordered and ordered arrangements of metal atoms. The authors propose a critical temperature, called the "Curie Point," at which the ordered state becomes more rapid and complete. They also discuss the energy content of alloys at different temperatures, the rate of attainment of equilibrium, and the relationship between various methods of analyzing order-disorder transformations.
