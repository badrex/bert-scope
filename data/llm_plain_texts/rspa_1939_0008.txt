tldr: The authors studied electron transfer in mercury vapour by accelerating positive ions and observing the energy distribution of the ions after collisions. They found that a head-on collision is required for electron transfer, and one of the resulting ions is excited by the process. The cross-section for the process is determined over the energy range of 140 to 400 electron-volts.
