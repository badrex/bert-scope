revised_title: 'Recent Developments in Nitrogen Fixation: A Chemical Perspective'
semantic_tags:
  - Nitrogen fixation
  - Transition metals
  - Biological nitrogen fixation
  - Nitrogen complexes
  - Chemical reduction
tldr: This discussion focuses on the recent developments in the chemistry of nitrogen fixation, particularly the role of transition metals in forming stable complex compounds with molecular nitrogen. The author highlights the significance of nitrogen complexes in providing a potential mild route from nitrogen to ammonia using chemically weak reducing systems. The author also discusses the electronic structure of the nitrogen molecule and how transition metal ions can attack it through a concerted electron-acceptor and electron-donor action.
