tldr: The author, James D. Forbes, conducted an experiment during the annular eclipse of May 15, 1836, to investigate the origin of the deficient rays in the solar spectrum. He found that there was no significant change in the number, position, or thickness of the dark bands during the eclipse, which suggests that the sun's atmosphere does not play a role in producing this phenomenon.
