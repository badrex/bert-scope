tldr: The authors studied the absorption of polar crystals in the infra-red spectrum and found that the absorption is due to the anharmonic character of the lattice vibrations. They explained that the main vibration is coupled to certain combinations between other normal vibrations, leading to maxima in the absorption and reflection spectra. This effect is general for all polar crystals, with the size of the absorption continuum varying between different crystals.
