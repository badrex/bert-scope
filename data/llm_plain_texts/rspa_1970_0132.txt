tldr: The authors conducted an experiment using photographic emulsions flown on balloons to study the tracks of relativistic, highly charged nuclei in cosmic radiation. They found 60 tracks and presented the resulting charge spectrum. The observed structure in the charge spectrum suggests that nuclei of the cosmic radiation have been synthesized by the process of rapid neutron capture. The authors also discussed the photometric density of tracks in the emulsion and the way it varies with the velocity and charge of the particle producing the track.
