tldr: The authors studied the structure of imidazole-methaemoglobin, a compound formed when haemoglobin combines with imidazole. They found that the crystals have a similar structure to monoclinic methaemoglobin but with a different arrangement of molecules in each layer. The X-ray data provided an independent check for the sequence of signs along certain layer lines of the molecular transform, and the findings have implications for understanding the structure of haemoglobin and the use of X-ray optics.
