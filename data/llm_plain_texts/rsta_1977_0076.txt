tldr: This article discusses the chemistry of carbon in the lunar regolith, focusing on the roles of solar wind and meteoritic impacts. The authors examine various processes that contribute carbon to the lunar environment and provide methods for analyzing carbon species in lunar samples. They identify four main types of carbon in the lunar regolith, including trapped gases, hydrolysable species associated with iron, ionic carbides, and cyanides. The study helps to understand the impact of solar wind and meteorites on the lunar surface and the potential for life on the Moon.
