revised_title: 'Improving Classical Equations of Motion for Electrons'
semantic_tags:
  - Electromagnetic Field Theory

  - Particle Physics
  - Quantum Electrodynamics
tldr: The authors explore alternative approaches to the classical theory of particles, specifically the equations of motion for electrons in an electromagnetic field. They discuss the limitations of the Lorentz-Dirac equations and propose new equations that do not contain higher derivatives of velocity, aiming to provide a more consistent theory.
