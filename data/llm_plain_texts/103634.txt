tldr: This article describes a unique case of conjoined twins born to Sebastiana Camus in 1722. The twins shared one head, one neck, one breast, one abdomen, and two hands on one side, with separate legs and a single fundament for both. They were able to eat, drink, sleep, and cry separately, and were baptized. The author, Colin Mac Laurin, provides a detailed account of the twins' physical appearance, birth, and initial health status.
