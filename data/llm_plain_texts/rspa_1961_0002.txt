tldr: The tunnel theory of fluids is a model that breaks down the fluid into subsystems of lines of molecules moving almost one-dimensionally in tunnels. This model is applied to the 12:6 fluid, providing calculated values for liquid densities, compressibilities, and vapor pressures that are close to experimental values for simple liquids. The tunnel theory offers advantages over other models, such as allowing density fluctuations and providing a disordered structure, making it easier to calculate energy and entropy.
