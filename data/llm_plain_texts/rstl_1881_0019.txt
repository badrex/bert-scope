tldr: The authors, George J. Romanes and J. Cossar Ewart, conducted a detailed study on the locomotor system of echinodermata, specifically Holothuria communis. They observed the polian vesicle, circular canal, and tentacle sinuses, and analyzed their functions in the locomotion and respiration of the organism. They also examined the radial canals, pedicels, and ampullae, and their roles in the circulatory system of the echinodermata.
