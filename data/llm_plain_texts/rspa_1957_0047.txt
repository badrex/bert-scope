tldr: The author proposes a new approximation for the radial distribution function, which is an improvement over the well-known superposition assumption of Kirkwood. This new approximation is introduced into the Born-Green integral equation for the radial distribution function and is applied to the ideal case of a gas of rigid spheres. The results show that the new approximation is more accurate and consistent compared to previous methods.
