tldr: Researchers used X-ray diffraction to refine the structure of chrysene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. They found that the molecule has a planar structure with some atoms not in the same plane. The study also revealed that chrysene vibrates as a rigid body and provided insights into the molecule's thermal parameters and intermolecular distances.
