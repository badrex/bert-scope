tldr: The author investigates the irritability and movement of fern fronds, specifically in Asplenium bulbiferum, focusing on graviperception. They observe various types of movement and how they respond to light and gravity. The study shows that fern fronds have a different response to gravity compared to angiosperms, with longer latent and reaction periods. The findings contribute to our understanding of plant biology and the complex interactions between light, gravity, and plant growth.
