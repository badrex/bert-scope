tldr: The author examines the stomach structure of different whale species and compares it to the stomachs of ruminating animals like the bullock and camel. They discovered similarities in the structure and function of the stomach cavities, which helped them understand the process of digestion in these animals. The study also revealed that the fourth stomach cavity in whales is the one where the food is converted into chyle, similar to the human stomach.
