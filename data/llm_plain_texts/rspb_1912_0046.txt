tldr: The authors conducted a biometric study of Trypanosoma Rhodesiense, a dimorphic trypanosome responsible for sleeping sickness in humans. They measured 1000 specimens and found differences in size and morphology compared to other trypanosomes. The study provides insights into the distribution of the trypanosome in various hosts and its potential implications for disease transmission.
