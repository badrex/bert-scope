tldr: This paper by John William Lubbock discusses the current state of tidal research and the challenges in constructing accurate tide tables. He compares the theoretical approaches of Bernoulli and Whewell and highlights the discrepancies between their theories and Mr. Dessiou's observational calculations. Lubbock emphasizes the need for more extensive research and financial support to improve the understanding of tides.
