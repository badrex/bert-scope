tldr: The authors used high-resolution infrared spectroscopy with tunable diode lasers to study the fundamental band of NF2 (X2B1). They assigned almost 300 absorption lines and obtained new rotational, distortion, and spin-rotation parameters for the v1=1 level. The analysis also included a preliminary study of the Coriolis interaction through the inertial defect.
