tldr: The authors studied the transformation of N-bromoacetanilide into p-bromoacetanilide in non-aqueous solvents, focusing on acid catalysis. They found that the reaction showed general acid catalysis and was influenced by the solvent's dielectric constant and associating power. The results provide insights into acid catalysis in non-aqueous solvents and the role of carboxylic acids in these reactions.
