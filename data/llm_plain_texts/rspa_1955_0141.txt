tldr: The authors develop a formally exact cell theory of liquids, considering multiple occupation of cells, correlation effects, and the'smearing' approximation. They evaluate the integrals required for the theory and discuss the importance of molecular interactions, communal free energy, and correlation effects in the liquid region. The results provide insights into current cell theories and contribute to the understanding of liquids' behavior.
