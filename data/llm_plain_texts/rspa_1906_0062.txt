tldr: This study investigates the influence of introducing methyl groups into amino acids, specifically para-aminobenzoic acid and glycine, on their basic and acidic constants. The researchers determined the constants using various methods, including catalysis, solubility, and conductivity measurements. The findings provide insights into the behavior of amphoteric electrolytes and their potential applications in chemical processes.
