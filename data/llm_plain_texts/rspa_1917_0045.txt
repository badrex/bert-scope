tldr: This article discusses the relationship between the gravitational attraction of a load and the elastic depression caused by that load on an isotropic elastic solid. The author presents a historical overview of the topic, tracing its origins to a note by Sir G. H. Darwin in 1882. The article focuses on the case of an incompressible material and provides a proof for this specific scenario.
