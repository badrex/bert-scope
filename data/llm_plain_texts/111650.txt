tldr: The author, William Thomson, describes the measurement of the electrostatic force produced by a Daniell's battery using an absolute electrometer. The experiment involved comparing the indications of an electroscopic or torsion electrometer to absolute measurements. The results showed the attraction between the discs of the portable electrometer at a distance of 1/4 of an inch, maintained at a difference of potentials amounting to that produced by 284 cells, was 12 grains. The author concludes that with an electromotive force or difference of potentials produced by 1000 cells of Daniell's battery, the force of attraction is 55.3 grains per square foot between discs separated to a distance of 1/8 of a foot.
