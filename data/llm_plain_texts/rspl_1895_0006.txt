tldr: The author, William Ramsay, discovered a new gas while investigating a gas obtained from cleveite, a uranate of lead. This new gas, later named helium, had a unique yellow line in its spectrum that matched the solar element helium. The discovery of helium and its properties expanded the understanding of gas chemistry and spectroscopy.
