tldr: This article investigates the long-wave behavior of the virtual mass in water of finite depth. The authors extend Ursell's long-wave investigation by studying the gradient of the virtual mass for small values of the wavenumber. They find that the gradient is positive in the limit of zero frequency when the wavenumber is sufficiently small, and that the virtual mass has a maximum near this limit. The results suggest that this maximum may be expected for bodies of more general sections.
