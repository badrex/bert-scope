tldr: This article presents an experimental method to study the surface potentials and molecular architecture of unimolecular films of long-chain fatty acids. The authors investigate the surface potential in various states, including the vaporous, liquid, mesophasic, and solid condensed states, and analyze the effects of two-dimensional pressure and substrate on the surface potential.
