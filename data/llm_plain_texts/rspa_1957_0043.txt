tldr: The author investigates the aerodynamic forces on an oscillating aerofoil with a spoiler. They develop a theoretical model that considers two vortex sheets trailing downstream and analyze the pressure distribution, lift, and moment. The study shows that a stalled or partially stalled aerofoil has less aerodynamic damping than an unstalled aerofoil.
