tldr: The article examines the structure of human spermatozoa using electron microscopy, revealing variations in size, shape, and opacity. It discusses the head's substructures, including the presence of a galea capitis, and the complexity of the head's surface. The study also investigates the neck, middle-piece, tail, and tail-end of the sperm, providing a detailed description of their structure and dimensions. The effects of temperature shock on sperm are also discussed, highlighting the impact on staining reactions and fertility.
