tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study resonance phenomena in the scattering of -particles by light nuclei, such as helium, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and neon. They used a high-energy resolution setup and observed resonance phenomena in the scattering ratio for different -particle energies. This research helped to understand the conditions required to observe resonance in scattering experiments and provided insights into nuclear structure and particle physics.
