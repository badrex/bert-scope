tldr: 'The authors discuss the importance of genetical demography in understanding population changes and forecasting future trends. They emphasize the need for a comprehensive approach that combines classical genetics and biometrical genetics to study human populations. The authors also highlight the challenges and opportunities in studying human genetics, such as the long generations, small families, and limited mating control. They stress the significance of demographic data in making informed decisions for the well-being of society.'
