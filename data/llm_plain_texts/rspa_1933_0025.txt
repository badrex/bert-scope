tldr: The authors studied the absorption spectra of nitrogen pentoxide (N2O5), tungsten trioxide (WO3), and tellurium trioxide (TeO3) and found that all of them showed a similar pattern of absorption, with a first absorption on the long wavelength side, a patch of retransmitted light, and a second region of absorption. They used various methods to obtain the substances in pure form and studied their absorption spectra using a quartz spectrograph.
