tldr: The author, Edward Sabine, discusses the magnetic observations made in different parts of the globe and the periodical laws that determine their relative frequency and amount at different hours of the day and night. He presents the results of the photographic records of the Kew Declinometer from 1858 to 1861, which show the progression of the decennial variation and the importance of maintaining these records for further study.
