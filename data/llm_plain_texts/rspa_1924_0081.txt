revised_title: 'A New Approach to Molecular Fields: Viscosity and Temperature Relations'
semantic_tags:
  - Molecular Physics
  - Viscosity
  - Temperature Dependence
  - Gas Dynamics
  - Intermolecular Forces
tldr: The authors investigate the relationship between viscosity and temperature in gases, focusing on the molecular fields that affect their behavior. They develop a new formula that accounts for both repulsive and attractive forces between molecules, improving upon previous models and providing a more accurate representation of observed data.
