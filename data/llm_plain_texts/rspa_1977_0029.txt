tldr: The authors study the adsorption of a multi-component mixture of hard sphere particles onto a plane hard surface using the Percus-Yevick approximation. They calculate the monolayer densities, surface excess densities, and density variations as a function of distance from the surface, considering the effects of adsorbate particle size and adsorption potential strength. This research provides insights into the competitive adsorption process and the role of hard sphere interactions in determining the structure of adsorbed fluids.
