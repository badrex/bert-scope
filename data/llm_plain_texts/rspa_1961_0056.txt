tldr: The author investigates the energy reception of electromagnetic waves by a localized receiver. They consider the non-harmonic case and find that a well-defined maximum energy exists, depending on the length of the reception interval. The author also explores different scenarios, such as varying the transmitting and receiving currents, to determine the optimum energy absorption.
