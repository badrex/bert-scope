tldr: The author presents various experiments conducted to understand the communication and propagation of electricity. They discuss the exceptions to Du Fay's rule, the velocity of electricity, and the proportion in which electric matter is communicated to bodies. The author concludes that electricity is communicated to bodies in proportion to their surfaces and that the velocity of electricity is much greater than the speed of sound.
