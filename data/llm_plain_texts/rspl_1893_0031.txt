tldr: This article examines the alleged increase in cancer mortality rates and the role of improved diagnosis in the figures. The authors analyze death rates from different sources, including England and Wales, Scotland, and Ireland, and compare them with data from the Scottish Widows' Fund Life Assurance Society and the city of Frankfurt. They conclude that the apparent increase in cancer is mainly due to improved diagnosis and that the actual cancer mortality rates have not increased.
