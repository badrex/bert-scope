tldr: The author developed a method of artificial parasitization to study the defense reactions of various insect hosts to internal parasitoids. They injected eggs of the ichneumonid Nenteritis canescens into larvae of different species to observe their reactions, which included encapsulation and melanin deposition. The study found that each host species had a unique reaction to the parasite, but hosts belonging to the same family reacted similarly, reflecting their relationships.
