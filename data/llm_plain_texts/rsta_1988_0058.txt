revised_title: 'Dust Discs Around Low-Mass Main-Sequence Stars: A Key to Solar System Formation'
semantic_tags:
  - Circumstellar discs
  - Low-mass star formation
  - Dust disc properties
  - Stellar evolution
  - Planetary system formation
tldr: 'The authors discuss the formation and evolution of circumstellar dust discs around low-mass main-sequence stars. They review current understanding of the process and examine the properties of discs around these stars, including the four well-known prototypes Lyr, Pic, Eri, and HL Tau. The authors also discuss the orbital evolution and replenishment of grains in these discs, which play a crucial role in the formation of planetary systems.'
