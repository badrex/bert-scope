tldr: This article discusses the authors' observations and findings during the total solar eclipse of May 17, 1882. They used a prismatic camera and spectroscopy to study the corona and prominences, discovering differences in the corona's shape and structure compared to previous eclipses. The authors also analyzed the spectra of prominences, finding differences in their relative intensities and temperatures. They identified several new lines in the ultra-violet and confirmed the green line of the corona as a distinct coronal line.
