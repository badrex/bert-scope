tldr: The authors describe a method to induce abnormal cell division in mitotic HeLa cells, resulting in the formation of mini segregants with subdiploid amounts of DNA. This phenomenon is affected by factors such as pH, the presence of dithiothreitol, serum, and glucose in the incubation medium. The production of these aberrant segregants may provide insights into the regulation of events during normal cell division.
