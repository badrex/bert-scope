tldr: The authors describe the morphology and comparison of interplexiform cells in the mammalian retina with catecholamine-containing retinal cells. They found that interplexiform cells have processes branching in both inner and outer plexiform layers and may have different pharmacological types. Additionally, they discovered an inner nuclear layer plexus of fibers in the squirrel monkey's retina that synapses within the inner nuclear layer onto bipolar and amacrine cells.
