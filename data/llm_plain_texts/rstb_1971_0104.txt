tldr: The study investigates the termination of afferent fibers in the caudate nucleus using electron microscopy and axon terminal degeneration methods. The research shows that the degenerating terminals of all afferent fibers to the caudate nucleus have asymmetrical membrane thickenings and mainly end on dendritic spines. The projection from the ipsilateral cerebral cortex is greater than that from the thalamus, which in turn is heavier than that from the contralateral cortex or midbrain. The findings provide insights into the complex neural connections and pathways within the brain.
