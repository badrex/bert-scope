tldr: 'The authors studied the angular distribution of light produced by two mesopelagic fish species, Argyropelecus affinis and Chauliodus sloani, and found that their light distributions match the external daylight field in the ocean. This supports the hypothesis that the function of many photophores is to provide camouflage for these deep-sea animals.'
