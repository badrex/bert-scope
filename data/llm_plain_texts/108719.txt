tldr: This article investigates the conductibility of heat in mercury and amalgams. The authors discovered that mercury is the worst conductor of heat when heat application prevents mass heating. They also found that the conductibility of heat in amalgams confirms the figure representing the conductibility of mercury. The authors support Joule's heat theory, which states that heat is conveyed in bodies by the vibrations of solid molecules.
