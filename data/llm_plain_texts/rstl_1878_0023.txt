tldr: 'The author conducted experiments using a whirling machine to determine the constants of the cup anemometer, a device used to measure wind speed. The study aimed to improve the accuracy of anemometer measurements and better understand the behavior of air vortices. The author found that the anemometer's constants were influenced by various factors, such as the machine's design and the surrounding environment, which needed to be considered for accurate measurements.'
