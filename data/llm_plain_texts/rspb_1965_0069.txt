tldr: The author investigates the energy consumed by bacteria during growth and identifies a constant rate of energy used for cell maintenance. They develop a new analysis using the'maintenance coefficient' and test the theory with various bacterial data, finding a linear relationship between the maintenance coefficient and growth rate. This discovery helps to understand the energy requirements of bacteria in different growth conditions.
