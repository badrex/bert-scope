tldr: In this article, Thomas Young presents his experiments and findings on sound and light. He investigates the quantity of air discharged through an aperture, the direction and velocity of a stream of air, and the behavior of sound and light waves. Young's work laid the foundation for future research in acoustics, optics, and fluid dynamics.
