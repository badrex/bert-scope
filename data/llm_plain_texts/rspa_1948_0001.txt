tldr: The Plymouth laboratory of the Marine Biological Association has been a significant center for marine research since its establishment in 1888. Initially focusing on fishery research and the study of marine fauna and flora, the laboratory has expanded its scope to include fundamental research on the environment, life histories, and development of marine organisms. Today, the laboratory continues to contribute to our understanding of the sea's productivity, the biology of marine animals, and the factors affecting fish populations.
