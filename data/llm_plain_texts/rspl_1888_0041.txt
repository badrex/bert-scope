tldr: The electric organ of the skate, specifically in the species Raia radiata, is studied for its development and differences compared to other species. The organ is found to be relatively small and structurally simple, consisting of minute shallow cups. The development process is slow, with the organ undergoing progressive changes rather than degeneration. This challenges the idea that the organ is a vestige of a larger structure, as it has well-developed nerves and a complete motor plate.
