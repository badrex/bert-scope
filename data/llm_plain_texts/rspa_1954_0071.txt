tldr: The authors discuss methods to determine past temperature changes in the upper layer of the Equatorial Atlantic Ocean using deep-sea cores. They focus on the use of planktonic Foraminifera, which are sensitive to temperature changes and secrete calcareous shells. The authors describe essential conditions for core selection, such as a constant rate of sedimentation and minimal disturbance, and discuss the significance of their findings for understanding past climate changes.
