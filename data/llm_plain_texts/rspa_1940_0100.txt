tldr: The authors investigated the thermal decomposition of acetophenone and found that it is a nearly first-order, homogeneous reaction. The main products are carbon monoxide, toluene, methane, and carbon. The reaction does not involve a chain mechanism, as it is not inhibited or accelerated by nitric oxide and does not show any evidence of chain reactions. This contrasts with the behavior of benzaldehyde and acetaldehyde, which do show chain reactions.
