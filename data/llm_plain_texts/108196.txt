tldr: This article describes a new tide-gauge design created by T. G. Bunt, which measures water levels along the River Avon. The device uses a float that rises and falls with the tide, turning a vertical cylinder to record the time and height of high water. The design is accurate, efficient, and can be used for coastal monitoring and hydraulic engineering applications.
