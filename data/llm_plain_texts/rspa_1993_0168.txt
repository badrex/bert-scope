tldr: This article provides corrections for figures 6 and 10 in the paper "Incremental Constitutive Relations for Granular Materials based on Micromechanics" by M. M. Mehra badi, B. Loret, and S. Nemat-Nasser. The corrected figures show the distribution of contact forces and the ratio of shear to normal forces in granular materials.
