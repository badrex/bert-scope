tldr: The author observed an exceptionally bright night sky and conducted spectroscopic analysis to determine if it was a polar aurora. The study found that the night sky brightness was not a polar aurora, as it did not display the same characteristics, such as the negative nitrogen bands. The author also compared the night sky spectrum with a polar aurora spectrum, highlighting the differences between the two phenomena.
