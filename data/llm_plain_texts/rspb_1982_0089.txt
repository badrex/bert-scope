revised_title: 'Synthesis of Brain GABA Receptors in Frog Oocytes'

tldr: Researchers discovered that frog oocytes can synthesize GABA receptors from chick brain mRNA. These receptors are inserted into the oocyte membrane, forming receptor-channel complexes that respond to GABA and related agonists. This finding provides a novel approach to studying brain receptors and their functions.
