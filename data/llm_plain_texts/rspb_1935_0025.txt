tldr: The authors conducted experiments on hypophysectomized birds to study the effects of hormone replacement therapy on their gonads, accessory organs, and secondary sexual characteristics. They found that while anterior pituitary extracts could delay testis atrophy, they were unable to maintain spermatogenesis or prevent comb shrinkage. Additionally, thyroxine treatment failed to prevent plumage changes in hypophysectomized birds.
