tldr: The author presents a series-parallel model of the voltage-gated sodium channel, which takes into account its biophysical properties and molecular structure. The model helps explain the timecourses of the gating and macroscopic sodium currents in the squid giant axon. The study also discusses the voltage dependence of inactivation and the kinetics of the subsequent recovery, providing insights into the channel's behavior and potential applications in neuroscience.
