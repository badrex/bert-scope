tldr: The study investigates the behavior of blood cells and rigid spheres in an annular vortex formed by the sudden concentric expansion of a 15.1mm into a 504mm diameter glass tube. The results show that single blood cells and latex spheres 20μm in diameter migrate across the streamlines out of the vortex, while larger spheres and aggregates of red cells 30μm in diameter remain in the vortex at all Reynolds numbers. The findings provide a mechanism for the accumulation and growth of blood cell aggregates in the vortex, which may be relevant to the formation of thrombi in blood vessels.
