tldr: John William Lubbock demonstrates that the stability of a planetary system is not dependent on the assumption of circular orbits and neglecting higher powers of the disturbing forces. He provides expressions for the variations of elliptic constants that are rigorously true, regardless of the power of the disturbing force.
