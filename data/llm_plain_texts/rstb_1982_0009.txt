tldr: 'The article discusses the challenges and opportunities of managing animal waste in European livestock production. It highlights the need for efficient waste disposal due to the large volume of waste produced and the potential environmental impact. The author also emphasizes the fertilizing value of animal waste, which can help reduce the reliance on chemical fertilizers and save costs for farmers. The European Commission sponsored a research program to assess the levels of fertilizing elements in animal waste and establish models to predict environmental effects and economic aspects of waste spreading. The main results focus on the characterization of animal waste and its use for arable crops, grassland, and forage crops, along with recommendations for administrative action.'
