revised_title: 'A New Insight into Photosynthesis: Cyclic Phosphorylation by Illuminated Chloroplasts'
semantic_tags:
  - Photosynthesis
  - Cyclic phosphorylation

  - NADP reduction
  - Hill reaction
tldr: The article discusses the mechanism of cyclic phosphorylation by illuminated chloroplasts, focusing on the Hill reaction and the role of NADP in reducing power and molecular oxygen production. The authors explore the significance of cyclic phosphorylation in relation to the energy requirements of the overall light reaction and the role of various catalysts, such as FMN and vitamin K3, in the process.
