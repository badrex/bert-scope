tldr: The authors studied the dielectric properties of aqueous solutions of sodium salts of ribonucleic acid and deoxyribonucleic acid. They found that these solutions exhibit a general pattern of behavior, with indications of a low-frequency dispersion region. The authors used the O'Konski theory of ionic polarization and the equilibrium between counterions to explain their findings.
