revised_title: 'Oblique Radio Wave Propagation and Limiting Polarization in the Ionosphere'
semantic_tags:
  - Ionosphere
  - Radio wave propagation
  - Electromagnetic waves
  - Polarization
  - Wave coupling
tldr: This article explores the theory of limiting polarization of radio waves emerging obliquely from the ionosphere. The authors develop a theory for obliquely traveling waves and present some results, including the dependence of limiting polarization and complex limiting height on the electron distribution, direction of propagation, and collision frequency distribution in the ionosphere.
