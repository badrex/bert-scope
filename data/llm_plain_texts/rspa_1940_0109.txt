tldr: The authors study the apparent sizes of atoms in metallic crystals, specifically aluminum and indium, and their electronic states in alloys. They find that the apparent atomic size depends on the crystal structure and the characteristics of the Brillouin zone. The interatomic distances in crystals of alloys cannot be explained by assigning a fixed atomic radius to each atom, and the authors discuss various factors that influence the apparent atomic size.
