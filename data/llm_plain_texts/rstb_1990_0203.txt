tldr: 'The study examines motoneuron activity patterns in spinal dogfish during different types of swimming movements. Two groups of motoneurons were identified based on their activity patterns: Group I, which was inactive during Active swimming, and Group II, which fired bursts of action potentials in phase with motor nerve activity. The researchers suggest that Group II motoneurons innervate the red and superficial muscle fibers, while Group I motoneurons innervate the white muscle fibers. These different activity patterns likely reflect the distinct roles of the red and white muscle systems during locomotion.'
