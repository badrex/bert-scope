tldr: The author, Charles Bland Radcliffe, developed a new method of experimentation to detect electrostatic indications of animal electricity. This method uses two electroscopes charged with positive and negative electricity, allowing for more accurate detection of minute electrical quantities. The experiments demonstrate how the reaction of the charge in the electroscopes can be used to make the action of free electricity more obvious, providing a more conclusive result when dealing with small amounts of electricity.
