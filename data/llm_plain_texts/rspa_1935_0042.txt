tldr: The authors studied the band spectrum of aluminium bromide (AlBr) and analyzed its vibrational transitions and isotope effects. They observed that the bands were grouped in sequences and found that the separations of the heads increased in a progression, as expected. The isotope effect was also studied, and the authors concluded that the presence of both isotopes (Al-27 and Al-26) and their relative abundance affected the spectrum's intensity distribution.
