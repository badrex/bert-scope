tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments to determine the thermal expansion of sea-water and its relation to salinity. They found that the expansion of sea-water can be accurately described by a formula and that the rate of expansion is affected by the salinity of the water. This research is important for understanding the physical conditions of the ocean and the behavior of sea-water in various environments.'
