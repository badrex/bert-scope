tldr: This article discusses the metabolic adaptations that allow insects to survive in freezing temperatures. Insects use either freeze tolerance or freeze avoidance strategies, both of which involve the use of low molecular mass polyhydric alcohols as cryoprotectants. These adaptations help insects maintain their cellular structures and functions during cold exposure, ensuring their survival in harsh winter conditions.
