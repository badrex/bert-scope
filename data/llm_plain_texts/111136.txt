tldr: In 1850, a significant rainfall event occurred in the London area, with some locations receiving over an inch of rain in just a few hours. The author, James Glaisher, attributes the heavy rain to the meeting of two air currents of different temperatures, resulting in a rapid deposition of moisture. This event highlights the importance of understanding weather patterns and atmospheric conditions.
