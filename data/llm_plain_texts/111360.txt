tldr: The author examines the hydrocarbons in boghead coal and conducts experiments on the portion of the fluid that resists the action of monohydrated nitric and sulfuric acids. They identify and analyze propyl, butyl, and amyl radicals, providing their boiling points and chemical compositions. The paper also describes a method for determining vapor density without refilling the balloon with water or mercury.
