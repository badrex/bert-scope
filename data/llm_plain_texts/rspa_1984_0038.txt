tldr: The authors discuss the polarization and anisotropy of the cosmological microwave background radiation on large scales in the context of a quadrupole anisotropy in the expansion of the universe (shear). They calculate the resulting anisotropies and polarization in various cosmological models, considering spatial curvature and its effects on the radiation's polarization direction and the dipole-anisotropy distortion. The study provides insights into the spatial curvature of the universe and the density of matter, as well as the ionization history of the matter.
