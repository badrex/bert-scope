tldr: The author investigates the mechanics of mitosis in the pollen-tube of various Tulipa species. They observe the external movements and stages of mitosis, including prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. The author finds that the shape and position of the metaphase plate vary according to the size of the pollen-tube and the number of chromosomes. The study provides insights into the mechanics of mitosis in elongated cells and the behavior of chromosomes in pollen-tubes.
