tldr: This study examines the bile and various extracts of the livers of Mollusca, Arthropoda, and Echinodermata, discovering a universal chlorophyll pigment. It also investigates the presence of enterochlorophyll, hemochromogen, and other pigments in bile and urine, discussing their functions and distribution in different organisms. The research also explores the origin of biliverdin from blood pigment and the differences between stercobilin, hydrobilirubin, and febrile urobilin.
