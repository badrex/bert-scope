semantic_tags:
  - Atomic Refractivities
  - Optical Rotatory Power
  - Carbonyl Radical
  - Oxygen Radical
  - Carboxyl Radical
tldr: This article investigates the refractive indices of organic compounds, focusing on the refractivities of the oxygen, carbonyl, and carboxyl radicals. The authors deduce the refractivity of these radicals by analyzing the refractive indices of various compounds and discuss the implications of their findings on the theory of atomic refractivities and the optical properties of these radicals.
