tldr: The author compares the spectra of comets, nebulae, and aurorae, finding many similarities and differences. They observe that comets have fewer hydrogen lines and more dense vapors like magnesium and carbon, while nebulae have more hydrogen lines and a wider range of lines. The study strengthens the hypothesis that comets, nebulae, stars with bright lines, and aurorae have a common origin, independent of their chemical origins.
