tldr: The authors present a modified model of the action potential using three coupled first-order differential equations. This model introduces two additional equilibrium points and explains the transition from a silent state to a repetitively firing state when triggered by a short current pulse. The model also accounts for adaptation, resulting in either an isolated burst or a depolarizing afterpotential. The authors demonstrate that this model can produce periodic bursting and provide a simpler representation of bursting properties in terms of a Bonhoeffer-van der Pol type of model.
