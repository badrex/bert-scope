tldr: This article examines the nature of large-scale mantle flow using seismological mapping of the Earth's deep interior. It discusses three features of mantle heterogeneity, including the existence of a thick thermal boundary layer beneath ancient cratonic nuclei, the continental chemical boundary layer's stabilization, and the aspherical variations in seismic velocities in the transition zone and lower mantle. The study also highlights the importance of chemical boundary layers at the free surface and core-mantle interface in governing the configuration of these boundary layers and their interactions with mantle convection.
