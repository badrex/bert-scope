tldr: This study investigates the effects of percutaneous electrical stimulation on spinal nociceptive responses in rats. The results show that electrical stimulation can inhibit dorsal horn cell responses to noxious mechanical stimuli but has less effect on responses to innocuous stimuli. This inhibition appears to be a central phenomenon and may be partly due to a reduction of cell excitability in the dorsal horn's laminae.
