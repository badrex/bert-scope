tldr: This study investigates the thermochemical and thermodynamic aspects of ion exchange in a crystalline exchange medium, specifically Linde sieve. The authors constructed a simple calorimeter to measure the heats of exchange and used it to study the exchange equilibria. The results are discussed in terms of the energetic heterogeneity of distribution of cations and other factors, providing insights into the exchange process and solid-state reactions in crystals.
