tldr: The article explores the reasons behind the abandonment of Charles Babbage's Difference Engine No. 1 in 1842, focusing on the role of Sir John Herschel. It reveals that Herschel, a friend of Babbage and a member of the Royal Society, was asked for his opinion on the project by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Despite his reservations and the support of the Royal Society, Herschel's negative opinion, along with personal and political factors, led to the decision to abandon the project.
