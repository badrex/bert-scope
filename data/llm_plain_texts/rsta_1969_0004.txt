tldr: This article presents a formulation for electron collisions with ions in configurations and provides calculations for collisional excitation rates of forbidden lines in gaseous nebulae. The authors use Hartree-Fock functions for ion states and variational principles to obtain coupled integro-differential equations for radial functions. They calculate collision strengths for inelastic collisions in configurations q to 5 and discuss the implications of their findings for understanding the spectra of gaseous nebulae and deducing ion abundances.
