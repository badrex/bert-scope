tldr: The article explores baryon decays in the U(6) ⊗ U(6) ⊗ U(3) symmetry scheme, calculating two-body decay widths for the lowest submultiplets. The study considers octet-octet mixing and accounts for mass splitting using average masses. The results provide insights into the decay widths and help understand the behavior of baryons in the symmetry scheme.
