revised_title: 'The Chemical Properties and Stability of Vitamin D'
semantic_tags:
  - Vitamin D
  - Ergosterol
  - Antirachitic substance
  - Photochemistry
  - Sterols
tldr: The author discusses their research on the chemistry of irradiated ergosterol, which is converted into an antirachitic substance, presumably identical to vitamin D. They explore the physical and chemical properties of the irradiation product, including its solubility, melting point, and optical rotation. The author also examines the behavior of vitamin D with digitonin, its hydroxyl group, molecular weight, double bonds, and stability. They conclude that vitamin D is an isomeride of ergosterol and contains a system of conjugated double bonds.
