tldr: The authors collected urine samples from newborns and their mothers to study the renal function before and after birth. They found that foetal urine has a low osmolar concentration, with a large fraction due to sodium chloride and a small fraction due to urea. The study also showed that the kidney function before birth is not under the control of anti-diuretic, parathyroid, or suprarenal hormones.
