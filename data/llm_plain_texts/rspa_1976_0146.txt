revised_title: 'Gaussian Phantom Network and Rubber Elasticity'
semantic_tags:
  - Polymer chemistry
  - Rubber elasticity
  - Statistical thermodynamics
  - Network structure
  - Chain configurations
tldr: The authors study the statistical thermodynamics of random networks, specifically Gaussian phantom networks, and their application to rubber elasticity. They demonstrate that the stress in rubber networks originates from the configurations of the chains comprising the network, and discuss the implications of network structure on the properties of rubber-like materials.
