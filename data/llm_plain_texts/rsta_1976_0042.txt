tldr: This paper presents observations of solar flares in the far ultraviolet using instruments on board Skylab. The authors discuss three events in detail, analyzing the emission lines and spectra to understand the energy release and particle acceleration processes during flares. They find that a small kernel is the source of the prime energy release in flares, and that hot coronal gas surrounding the kernel may be the energy reservoir for heating post-flare loops. The observations also suggest that high-speed mass motions have their origin in the exploding flare kernel.
