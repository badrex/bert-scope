tldr: The authors conducted experiments with a radiometer, also known as a light-mill, to study the force produced by heat and light. They found that the force acting on the vessel enclosing the light-mill is equal and opposite to the force acting on the mill itself. The pressure from light is equal to the weight of a film of water on a horizontal surface equal in thickness to the length of a wave of violet light.
