tldr: The authors developed a method to measure the area of real contact between molecularly smooth surfaces and studied the shear strength of monomolecular layers of boundary lubricants. They used mica sheets with a monomolecular layer of calcium stearate and found that the shear strength of the lubricated junctions was significantly lower than that of clean, smooth mica surfaces. This discovery helps explain the reduced friction and wear observed in lubricated systems with single molecular layers of boundary lubricants.
