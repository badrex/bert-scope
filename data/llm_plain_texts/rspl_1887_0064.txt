tldr: The author discusses the geological implications of Mr. Davison's paper on mountain formation and the role of compression and tension in shaping the earth's crust. The author explains how older rocks, such as the Ordovician and Carboniferous, were deformed and cleaved due to geological processes. The study of these rocks can help us understand the formation of mountain chains along the borders of continents.
