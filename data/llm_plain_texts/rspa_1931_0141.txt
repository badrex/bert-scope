tldr: The authors studied the band spectrum of yttrium oxide (YO) and compared it to the spectra of scandium oxide (ScO) and lanthanum oxide (LaO) systems. They found that the band systems of these three molecules have a close resemblance and similar electronic structures. The study provides a vibrational quantum analysis of the band heads and discusses the implications of their findings for the understanding of these molecules' electronic transitions.
