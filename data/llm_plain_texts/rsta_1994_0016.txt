tldr: The authors study time-dependent systems of partial differential equations with solutions on different timescales, focusing on the existence of slow manifolds. They demonstrate how to initialize the system to suppress the fast timescale and approximate the system with a finite-dimensional Galerkin system, providing conditions for the existence of a slow manifold in the approximating system.
