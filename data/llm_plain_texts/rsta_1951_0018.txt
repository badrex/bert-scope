tldr: This study examines the effects of charge shape and range on underwater explosion measurements. Experiments were conducted using small charges, and pressure-time records were obtained at various distances from the charge. The results showed that shock-wave parameters, particularly close to the charge, depend on the shape of the explosive charge. The study confirms the importance of afterflow energy-flux density relative to the primary shock-wave energy-flux density, especially near the charge, and provides general confirmation of theories developed in the United States and the United Kingdom.
