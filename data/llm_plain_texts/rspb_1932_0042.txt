revised_title: 'The Role of Duodenal Mucosa in Pancreatic Secretion and Diabetes'
semantic_tags:
  - Diabetes
  - Pancreatic hormones
  - Duodenal mucosa
  - Secretin
  - Insulin
tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate the relationship between the duodenal mucosa and the internal secretion of the pancreas. They discovered that extracts from the duodenal mucosa could lower blood sugar levels in rabbits and dogs, suggesting the presence of a hormone that could potentially be involved in diabetes. The study also found that the duodenal preparation had no hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic effects on its own, but it could enhance the effects of insulin and secretin.
