tldr: 'Thomas Hornsby, a professor of astronomy, conducted a series of observations to determine the proper motion of Arcturus, a prominent star in the constellation BoÃ¶tes. By comparing his observations with those made by John Flamsteed in 1690, Hornsby found that Arcturus had moved westward and southward over time. This study helped improve our understanding of the positions and movements of stars, which is essential for accurate astronomical calculations and predictions.'
