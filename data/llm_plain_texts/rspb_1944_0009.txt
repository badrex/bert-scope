tldr: The study investigates the absorption of subcutaneously implanted hexoestrol tablets in various animals, including bovines, goats, rabbits, guinea-pigs, and rats. The researchers found that a rapid initial burst of absorption occurs shortly after implantation, followed by a linear absorption rate over time. The absorption rate is proportional to the tablet's surface area, and large tablets show reduced or non-existent absorption in some cases. This method of hormone administration provides a continuous dosage over prolonged periods, making it useful for both experimental and medical purposes.
