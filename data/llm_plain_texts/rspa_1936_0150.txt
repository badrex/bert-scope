tldr: The author investigates the oscillations of the atmosphere, assuming a uniform depth and temperature gradient. They analyze the equations of motion and conclude that the hypothesis of small pressure variations compared to the undisturbed pressure is incorrect. The study provides insights into understanding atmospheric oscillations and temperature variations.
