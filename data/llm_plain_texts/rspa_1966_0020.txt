tldr: The explosive combustion of aluminium trimethyl and oxygen mixtures was studied to understand the mechanism of spontaneous ignition of group 13 metal alkyls. The authors found that the ignition boundary is defined by the production of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, methane, acetylene, and other complex solid products. The branching reactions AlOOMe play a significant role in approaching the ignition limit. The proposed ignition mechanism involves initiation, branching through the reaction of Me2AlO with AlOOMe, and chain termination at the surface.
