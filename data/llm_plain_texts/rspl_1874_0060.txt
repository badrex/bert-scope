tldr: The author, Col. J. T. Smith, discusses his experiments on the liquation of silver and copper alloys and its effects on coinage. He found that cooling causes a partial separation of copper towards the surfaces, leading to variations in the fineness of coins. This discovery led to improvements in the valuation and quality control of coins, ensuring that every particle of silver entrusted to the mint could be accounted for.
