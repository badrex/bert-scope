tldr: The author studied the early development of the African migratory locust, Locusta migratoria migratorioides, and proposed a new theory of multi-phased gastrulation among insects. This research focused on the embryonic development, formation of the primary epithelium, and the role of the yolk and yolk cells in the process. The findings provide insights into the general problem of how the germ-layer theory applies to insects and contribute to the understanding of head segmentation in arthropods.
