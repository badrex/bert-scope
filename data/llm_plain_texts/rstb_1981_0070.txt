tldr: This article discusses the organization and evolution of genes, focusing on gene clusters and their implications for protein structure and function. The author highlights the importance of gene duplication and gene clusters in the evolution of new genetic functions and the flexibility of gene organization in higher eukaryotes. The article also explores the concept of structural DNA domains and their role in the formation of gene clusters and the evolution of protein sequences.
