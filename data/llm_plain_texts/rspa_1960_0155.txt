tldr: The authors investigate the order-disorder phenomena in α-brass by studying the development of order in slowly cooled and isothermally annealed specimens. They observe an absorption of energy associated with the destruction of order and attribute it to the destruction of long-range and short-range order. The results provide insights into the ordering process in α-brass, which can be useful for understanding its properties and potential applications.
