tldr: This article discusses the biochemistry and enzymology of dissimilatory sulfate reduction in sulfate-reducing bacteria. It highlights differences in the bioenergetics of respiratory sulfate reduction between Desulfovibrio and Desulfotomaculum, and presents new information on the enzymology of lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, adenylyl sulfate reductase, bisulfite reductase, and hydrogenase. The article also emphasizes the function of cytochrome in the mechanism of the periplasmic hydrogenase and the role of new non-hem iron centers in electron transfer.
