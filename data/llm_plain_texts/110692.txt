tldr: Eaton Hodgkinson's research investigates the strength of cast iron, wrought iron, and timber pillars. He found that the resistance to crushing by flexure is greater in flat-ended pillars than rounded ones. The study also determined the relationship between the strength of these materials and their dimensions, leading to approximate empirical formulae for calculating their breaking weight.
