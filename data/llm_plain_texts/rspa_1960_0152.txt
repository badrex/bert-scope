tldr: The authors studied the chemisorption of hydrogen on nickel films using advanced vacuum techniques and ionization gauges. They measured the pressure of hydrogen in equilibrium with adsorbed hydrogen on nickel films and calculated the molar and differential entropies, as well as the integral and isosteric heats of adsorption. The results showed that the adsorbed hydrogen was localized on energetically homogeneous sites, but also indicated the presence of sites with higher adsorption potential. Near complete coverage, the adsorbed hydrogen behaved like a two-dimensional gas.
