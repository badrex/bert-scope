tldr: This study investigates the effects of varying potassium (K+) concentrations on the steroid output of rat zona glomerulosa cells in the adrenal cortex. The authors found that cAMP plays a significant role in the stimulation of steroid output by K+ between 3.6 and 8.4 mM K+. In this range, the stimulation of cAMP seems to be controlled by increases in calcium influx. The results indicate that both cAMP and calcium are used as messengers for the stimulation of steroidogenesis by K+ in zona glomerulosa cells.
