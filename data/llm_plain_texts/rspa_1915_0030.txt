tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments to study the absorption of y-rays emitted by radium B and radium C in lead. They discovered that these rays consist of three types that are exponentially absorbed, and found that radium B and radium C emit different types of radiation. The results support the idea that radium C's very penetrating radiation is its K series characteristic radiation, while radium B's radiation belongs to a different series. The study also examines the absorption of these radiations by elements of similar atomic weight, such as mercury and gold.'
