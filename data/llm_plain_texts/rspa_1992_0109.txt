  - Bessel functions
  - Finite differences method
  - Cylindrical geometry
tldr: The authors present an analytical and numerical solution to the heat conduction equation in a finite cylinder with periodic boundary conditions. They focus on the case of steady oscillation and constant thermal properties, providing a reduced temperature distribution that can be used to improve thermal diffusivity measurements and study the influence of periodic temperature changes during thermal treatments.
