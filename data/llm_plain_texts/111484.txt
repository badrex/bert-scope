tldr: The author presents a new method for measuring gases in gas analysis, using a pressure-tube and eudiometer to maintain consistent temperature and pressure. This technique allows for more accurate results with less effort and eliminates the need for calculations. The method is demonstrated with the analysis of air deprived of carbonic acid.
