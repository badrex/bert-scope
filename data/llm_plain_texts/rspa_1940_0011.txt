tldr: The author investigates the torsional flexibility and distortion in aliphatic chain molecules using two normal chain ketones. They discovered that the increase in apparent symmetry of chain substances near their melting points is not only due to the rotation of the molecule as a whole but also due to internal distortion of the chains. This finding suggests that researchers should consider both factors when studying the structure of solid long-chain substances.
