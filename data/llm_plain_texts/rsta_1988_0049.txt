tldr: This article discusses the use of Cs and Sr isotopes as tracers in the Arctic Mediterranean Seas to study the regional circulation, deep convective mixing, and water ventilation processes. The authors found that the different input patterns of these tracers helped to reveal the role of Arctic Intermediate Water, deep convective mixing in the Greenland Sea, circulation of Atlantic water in the Arctic basins, and the role of Arctic shelfwaters in the ventilation of intermediate and deep water in the Eurasian and Canadian basins. The study provides valuable insights into the complex circulation and ventilation processes in the Arctic Mediterranean Seas.
