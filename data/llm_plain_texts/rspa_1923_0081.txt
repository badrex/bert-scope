tldr: The author investigates the stress distribution in a rectangular plate with two opposing edges sheared in opposite directions. They use a mathematical approach to determine the stress and strain distribution, finding that the top and bottom edges are practically free from shift, while the edge in between has a constant shear stress. The results are useful for understanding the behavior of plates under stress and can be applied to various engineering and construction scenarios.
