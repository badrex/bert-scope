tldr: This article derives a complete class of first-order conservation laws for two-dimensional deformations in general anisotropic elastic materials. The authors use Stroh's formalism and follow the general procedure proposed by Olver to construct conservation integrals. The conservation laws are connected with Cauchy's theorem for complex analytic functions, and real-form conservation laws are given for both degenerate and non-degenerate materials.
