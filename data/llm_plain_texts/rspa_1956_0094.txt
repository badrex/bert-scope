tldr: The authors analyze the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin and Thomas-Fermi approximations used in quantum mechanics to calculate the sum of eigenvalues. They demonstrate the process in one-dimensional and three-dimensional cases, discussing the errors introduced by integrating instead of summing and suggesting ways to correct them.
