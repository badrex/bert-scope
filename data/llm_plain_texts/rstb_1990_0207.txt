tldr: The study investigates the coordinated ciliary reversal and locomotion control in the pluteus larva of Lytechinus pictus. The main behavioral response is a coordinated reversal of cilia that occurs when the larvae come into contact with obstacles. This response helps the larvae avoid entanglement and obstacles. The research also explores the effects of various drugs on ciliary reversal and swimming behavior, including cholinergic and aminergic agents. The findings suggest a two-step control sequence involving an initial catecholamine-dependent step that triggers a cholinergic effector response.
