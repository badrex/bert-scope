tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the specific heats of cobalt and nickel, two metals with atomic weights close to each other. They used a calorimeter to measure the heat absorbed or released by the metals when they interacted with steam. The results showed that the specific heat of cobalt was slightly higher than that of nickel, and the author discussed the implications of these findings for the understanding of the relationship between specific heat and atomic weight.
