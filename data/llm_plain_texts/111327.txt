tldr: The author, Reuben Phillips, presents a theoretical explanation for the formation and motion of auroral arches. He suggests that streamers, which extend upwards from the arch, are disrupted discharges of finite length. The author also speculates on the nature of the auroral arch, considering it to be nebulous matter highly charged with electricity. Additionally, he discusses the movement of auroral arches from the pole towards the equator and speculates on the nature of fire-ball lightning and other subjects related to ordinary electricity.
