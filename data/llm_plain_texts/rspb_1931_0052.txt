tldr: The authors conducted research on Mediterranean Kala Azar, focusing on the Leishmania infantum parasite. They investigated the possibility of insects, specifically sandflies, transmitting the disease. The study found that the gecko, a common animal in the area, is not a factor in the transmission of the disease in Italy. The authors also explored the development of the parasite in vitro and its serological relations.
