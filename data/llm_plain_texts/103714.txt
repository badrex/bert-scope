tldr: The author presents the barometrical method of measuring the height of mountains using atmospheric pressure and the Torricellian tube. This method is based on the principle that a column of mercury in a barometer is counterpoised by a column of air of equal weight. The author discusses the work of various scientists, including Pascal, Mariotte, and Halley, who contributed to the development of this method and its applications. The author also shares two new tables to determine the height of the atmosphere at given altitudes of mercury, extracted from the observations of John James Scheuchzer.
