tldr: This study investigates the seasonal and spatial distribution of urea and its uptake by phytoplankton in the vicinity of a shallow-sea tidal mixing front in the western Irish Sea. The research found that urea concentrations remained relatively constant throughout the year, while urea uptake rates were significantly influenced by stratification. Urea played a crucial role in providing nitrogen for phytoplankton in surface, stratified waters, contributing to the high productivity associated with the frontal system.
