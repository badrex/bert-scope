tldr: The author conducted experiments on planarians, observing their regeneration and reproduction processes. They found that planarians can regenerate new heads and bodies from wounds and that the animals reproduce by detaching fragments of their bodies. The author also noted that planarians reproduce more quickly when kept separately, suggesting a voluntary regeneration process. The study includes observations on the Planaria nigra, which has an abdominal proboscis and is oviparous.
