tldr: This article investigates the effect of temperature on the velocities of ions produced by Rontgen rays in air at atmospheric pressure. The author uses an experimental method developed by Langevin to determine the velocities of ions in an electric field at different temperatures. The results show that between -173°C and -196°C, the velocities of both positive and negative ions are nearly directly proportional to the absolute temperature. However, at -140°C, the two velocities seem to be equal and much smaller than expected from this linear relationship.
