tldr: The study investigates the spectral properties and photosensitivities of analogue photopigments regenerated with 10- and 14-substituted retinal analogues. The research compares the effects of substituents at position 10 and 14 in retinal analogues on the gecko's transmuted opsin and the rhodopsin of the midshipman fish. The results show that 14-substituted analogues have a red-shifted spectrum and similar sensitivity to light compared to the parent retinal analogues, while 10-substituted analogues have reduced spectral absorbance and photosensitivity. The study also highlights the differences in binding sites and responses to chloride between the two opsins.
