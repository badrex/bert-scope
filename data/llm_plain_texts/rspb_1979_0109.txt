tldr: The authors conducted a scanning electron microscopical and histochemical study on the structure and function of basement membranes in early chick embryos. They discovered a regional pattern in the basement membrane's structure and chemical composition, which plays a role in directing the movement of mesoderm cells during embryonic development. The study also found a high concentration of glycosaminoglycan and large extracellular transformation sensitive protein at the area pellucida-area opaca boundary, suggesting their importance in cell movement and tissue organization.
