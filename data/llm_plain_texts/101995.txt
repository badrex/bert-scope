tldr: Sir Edm. King observed and documented various types of microscopic animalcula in pepper-water using a microscope. He discovered that these creatures resemble fish in their behavior, such as flocking together, following their liquid environment, and recovering from apparent death. King also demonstrated the creatures' sensitivity to various substances, such as spirit of vitriol, salt, and ink, by observing their reactions under the microscope.
