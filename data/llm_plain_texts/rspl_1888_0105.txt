tldr: This article investigates a chemical reaction between hydrogen chloride, chlorate, and potassium iodide. The authors discovered that the presence of potassium iodide allows the reaction to proceed at a uniform rate, preventing the accumulation of oxidizing substances. They also found that sunlight can reverse the reaction, and the role of potassium iodide is to facilitate the immediate oxidation of the reaction products, rather than participating in the primary reaction.
