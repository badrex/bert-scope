tldr: This article presents an asymptotic analysis of thermal explosions and criticality in systems with distributed temperatures. The authors develop analytical expressions for critical values of the Frank-Kamenetskii and Semenov parameters and center-temperature in terms of Biot number. The study covers a wide range of Biot numbers and can be applied to various geometries, including infinite slabs, infinite cylinders, and spheres.
