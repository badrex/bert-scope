tldr: The author examines the Electric and Chemical theories of Galvanism, questioning the principles of the Electric theory proposed by Volta. Through various experiments, the author demonstrates that the electric states of metals are influenced by factors such as the oxidizing action of the air, the type and dilution of acids, and the hardness of the metals. The author also explores the role of acids in combining with metals and the effect of temperature on the results.
