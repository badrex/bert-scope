article is as follows. In SS2 we present a number of axially symmetric flows of compressible granular materials obeying the Coulomb-Mohr yield condition and the associated flow rule. In particular, we focus attention on plastic re'gimes AB and OF and present new solutions for the velocity and stress fields. In SS3 we examine the Butterfield \amp ; Harkness ( 1972 ) modification of the double-shearing model of granular materials which incorporates both the double-shearing theory and the Coulomb-Mohr flow rule as special cases. In particular, we consider the kinematically determined plastic re'gimes and flows and present new solutions for the velocity and stress fields. In SS4 we examine statically determined flows arising from the assumption that the shear stress in either cylindrical or spherical polar coordinates is zero. In the final section we present a numerical solution for the flow of a granular material in a converging hopper which incorporates gravitational effects. The paper concludes with some remarks on the Butterfield \amp ; Harkness ( 1972 ) modification of the double-shearing model of granular materials and the prospect of devising experiments which might validate or otherwise one theory or the other. 2. Axially symmetric flows of compressible granular materials obeying the Coulomb-Mohr yield condition and the associated flow rule In this section we consider a number of axially symmetric flows of compressible granular materials obeying the Coulomb-Mohr yield condition and the associated flow rule. We focus attention on plastic re'gimes AB and OF and present new solutions for the velocity and stress fields. The governing equations for these plastic re'gimes are given in the Appendix. 2.1. Plastic re'gime AB For plastic re'gime AB, the velocity field is kinematically determined and the stress field is given by ( 2.1 ) where is a constant and is given by ( 1.5 ). The velocity field is given by ( 2.2 ) where is a constant and is given by ( 1.5 ). The constants and are related to the angle of internal friction and the cohesion of the material. The solution for the velocity and stress fields is given in the Appendix. 2.2. Plastic re'gime OF For plastic re'gime OF, the velocity field is kinematically determined and the stress field is given by ( 2.3 ) where is a constant and is
