tldr: The authors present a fully relativistic treatment of non-radial oscillations in a Newtonian star. They show that the oscillations can be induced by the scattering of incident gravitational waves by the star's spacetime. The study reveals that closed Newtonian systems do not give rise to any emergent gravitational radiation, even in the case of dipole oscillations. The findings contribute to the understanding of the non-radial oscillations of stars and their interactions with gravitational waves.
