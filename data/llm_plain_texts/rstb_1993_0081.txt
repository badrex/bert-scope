tldr: The authors developed a method for monitoring the aerial migration of insects using vertical-looking radar. This technique allows for the automatic gathering and processing of data related to insect speed, direction, alignment, wingbeat frequency, and size and shape parameters. The potential uses of this technique include monitoring insect pest movements in agriculture and assessing long-term changes in insect biomass and faunal diversity due to environmental perturbations.
