tldr: 'This study investigates the growth patterns in six species of Darwin's finches and two subspecies, focusing on nestling growth. The research shows how different beak and body size proportions among adult finches are achieved through ontogeny. The results demonstrate that evolutionary changes in embryonic, nestling, and post-fledging growth characteristics contribute to the adaptive differentiation of Darwin's finch species in adult bill morphology and size.'
