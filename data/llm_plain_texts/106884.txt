tldr: "The author, George Fordyce, describes a new pendulum design that is less affected by changes in temperature. By adjusting the fixed point and using materials with different expansion rates, the pendulum maintains a more consistent length despite fluctuations in heat. This discovery could improve the accuracy of clocks and other instruments that rely on pendulums."
