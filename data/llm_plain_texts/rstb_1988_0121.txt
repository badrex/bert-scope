tldr: The article discusses the accidental recombination between the X and Y chromosomes in humans, which occasionally allows the transfer of Y-linked sequences to the X chromosome, leading to testis differentiation in XX males. The author also explores the possibility that sex determination in humans is a quantitative trait, with males having two active doses of the gonad-determining gene and females having one dose. The findings support the concept of accidental recombination as an important factor in the aetiology of XX males and XY females.
