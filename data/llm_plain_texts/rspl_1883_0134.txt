tldr: The authors conducted spectroscopic studies on gaseous explosions, focusing on the metallic lines produced during the explosions. They observed and identified various iron lines in the flashes, as well as lines from other metals like nickel and cobalt. Their findings provide insights into the temperature variations and chemical reactions occurring during gaseous explosions.
