tldr: This paper presents experiments conducted to determine the solubility of various salts in water at high temperatures. The authors found that solubility is directly related to fusibility, and they discussed the limitations of hydration theories in explaining the act of solution. The study included the solubility of sulfate of soda and other metallic salts.
