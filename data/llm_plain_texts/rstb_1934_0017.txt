tldr: This article investigates the structure and organization of the cell wall in conifer tracheids, which are elongated cells that make up the majority of a tree's wood. The author examines the process of radial growth in conifers and explores the role of cellulose in the cell walls of these cells. By using physical methods and analyzing the structure of adult wood elements, the author aims to understand the properties of the tree's tissues and their industrial applications.
