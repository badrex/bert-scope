tldr: The author presents a thermal method for measuring the difference in vapour pressure between aqueous solutions. The method involves using a thermopile, which measures the difference in temperature between two faces, each with a strip of filter paper dipped in different solutions. The difference in temperature is proportional to the difference in vapour pressure, allowing for accurate measurements. This method can be used to study the effects of various concentrations and temperature changes on vapour pressure.
