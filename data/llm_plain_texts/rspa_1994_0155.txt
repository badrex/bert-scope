tldr: The authors explore the wave equation for the Lanczos potential, a tensor field that simplifies the Weyl curvature tensor in general relativity. They use spinor analysis to derive the wave equation and demonstrate its connection to gravitational radiation in both matter and vacuum. The study also establishes analogies between electromagnetic and gravitational theories, highlighting the similarities in their radiation theories.
