tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the energy transfer in gases after an electric discharge. They discovered that the energy collected from the gas was much higher than expected, suggesting that every molecule in the gas must be excited to a significant extent. This phenomenon was observed in various gases, including nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen, and could not be explained by current theories.
