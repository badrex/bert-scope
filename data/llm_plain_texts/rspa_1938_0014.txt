tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of temperature on the photochemical bleaching of visual purple solutions. They found that the rate of bleaching increased with temperature, and the quantum efficiency of the photochemical reaction remained constant. This study helps to understand the underlying mechanisms of visual pigment bleaching and its relation to temperature.
