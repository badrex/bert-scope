tldr: The article discusses the observations of intramembrane charge movements in skeletal muscle and their potential role in excitation-contraction coupling. The authors find two operationally separable types of intramembrane charge movement, and they analyze the relationship between charge displacement and membrane potential. The findings suggest that intramembrane charge movements could serve as a link between the transverse tubular system and the sarcoplasmic reticulum, playing a role in muscle contraction.
