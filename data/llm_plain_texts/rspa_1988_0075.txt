tldr: The authors develop a method for finite-element modeling of composite materials by analyzing the distribution of interparticle distance and applying it to the modeling of cylindrical cells. They use a theoretical approximation for the distribution of this distance within a Gibbs hard-core point process and find that their method provides close bounds for overall elastic properties of the material, showing reasonable agreement with experimental data.
