tldr: The authors studied the velocity of detonation in cast T.N.T. using a rotating-mirror camera. They examined the effects of variables such as purity, crystal size, diameter, and degree of confinement on the velocity of detonation. The results showed that cast T.N.T. can undergo stable or unstable detonation depending on the size of the crystals. The authors also found that heavy confinement reduces the boundary and limiting diameters, but the maximum velocity remains unchanged.
