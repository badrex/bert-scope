tldr: The article discusses the physical conditions and ionization structure of interstellar clouds observed by the Copernicus satellite. It presents a brief survey of the data collected on interstellar absorption lines between 95 and 300 nm, focusing on the determination of ionization state, density, radiation field, temperature, cloud motion, turbulence, and chemical composition. The study highlights the importance of further research and high-resolution scans to better understand the characteristics of gas at different velocities and improve the interpretation of the Copernicus data.
