tldr: This article describes experimental observations of overstable cellular convection in a layer of mercury heated uniformly from below and subject to Coriolis forces. The experiments confirm Chandrasekhar's theoretical predictions regarding the wave number of the cells and the characteristic period of the oscillatory motions. The hexagonal pattern of the convection cells and the periodic reversal of the convective circulation are clearly illustrated through the movement of tracers. The research provides insights into the nature of oscillatory convection and fluid instability.
