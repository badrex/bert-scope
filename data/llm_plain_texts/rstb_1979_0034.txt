tldr: This study examines the Late Quaternary vegetational history of the Enga province in Upland Papua New Guinea, analyzing pollen diagrams and general vegetational changes from three sites. The research provides insights into the forest composition, climate fluctuations, and human impact on the forests over the past 30,000 years. The findings reveal that the forest taxa have behaved consistently with their present distributions and ecological relationships, but also show deviations from these generalizations.
