tldr: This article discusses observations and measurements of galactic X-ray sources, focusing on compact X-ray sources, black holes, and X-ray pulsars. The authors present recent results from the Ariel 5 and Copernicus satellites, studying the regular periodicities in X-ray emission and the properties of various classes of sources. The findings contribute to understanding the mechanisms behind these systems and help provide coherent models for their behavior.
