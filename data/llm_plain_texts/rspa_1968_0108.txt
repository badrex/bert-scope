tldr: The authors studied the kinetics of reactions involving CN emission by measuring the concentration of CN radicals using electronic absorption spectroscopy. They investigated the reaction between oxygen atoms and cyanogen and confirmed the previously proposed mechanism. The initial step has a rate constant, and CN radicals are mainly removed by reactions (4) and (2). The rates of reaction of CN with NO and other species were also measured.
