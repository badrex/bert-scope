tldr: The authors conducted experiments using a Clusius column to separate hydrocarbon isomers through thermal diffusion. They found that the more flexible hydrocarbon molecules concentrated in the cold zone, resulting in a marked degree of separation for binary mixtures of various hydrocarbons. This discovery sheds light on the role of molecular flexibility in the separation process and has implications for the design of separation techniques in the future.
