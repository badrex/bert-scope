tldr: The authors conducted research on the development of Leishmania in sandflies, specifically Phlebotomus major and Phlebotomus Sergenti, and their role in transmitting Oriental Sore disease. They found that sandflies could be infected with the parasite by feeding on infected hamsters, suggesting the possibility of these insects being carriers. The study took place in China, where the sandfly season is short and collecting the insects posed challenges. The authors developed methods to collect, handle, and transfer sandflies for further research.
