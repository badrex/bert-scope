tldr: This article examines the twin-well Duffing oscillator, a central model for studying chaos and fractal basin boundaries in nonlinear dynamics. The authors identify new global bifurcations that organize the bifurcation set and structure related basin explosions and escape phenomena. They explore the complex behavior of the oscillator, including abrupt changes in fractal boundaries and the escape from one-well to cross-well motions, with implications for the dynamics of driven nonlinear oscillators.
