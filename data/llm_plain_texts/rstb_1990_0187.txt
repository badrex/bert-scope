tldr: 'Plant population dynamics are influenced by various factors such as plant size, successional change, recruitment, and mortality. Many plant populations have ephemeral or pulsed dynamics, while others show reasonably predictable trajectories. Plant populations are regulated by density-dependent processes, and the majority of species are successional, with recruitment depending on the death of dominant plants. The study of plant dynamics is essential for understanding the complex relationships between plants and their environment.'
