tldr: This study investigates the diffusion and binding characteristics of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated dextrans within oral biofilms using fluorescence photobleaching recovery (FRAP) methods. The researchers found that apparent diffusion rates in biofilms were highly dependent on biofilm preparation, with sucrose-starved biofilms showing a slowdown in diffusion. The FRAP approach provides a convenient method for determining diffusion rates within bacterial biofilms, which can have implications for understanding biofilm permeability and the effectiveness of antibacterial agents.
