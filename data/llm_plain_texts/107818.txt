tldr: The author, Thomas Drummond, discusses methods to improve the observation of distant stations in geodetic operations. He explains the use of solar reflection from plane mirrors and the development of a powerful focal light for better visibility in triangulation. These techniques were applied to the new survey of Ireland and the connection of western shores of Scotland and England.
