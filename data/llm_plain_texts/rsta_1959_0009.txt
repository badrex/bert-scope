tldr: This article presents an experimental and theoretical study of elastic wave propagation near a fluid-solid interface. The authors investigate the pressure response generated by an impulse-excited point source and compare experimental results with theoretical calculations. They discover a pseudo-Rayleigh wave with unique properties, which is a significant contributor to the overall response. The study provides insights into understanding wave propagation in complex environments and has implications for seismology and earthquake research.
