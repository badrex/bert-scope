tldr: The study investigates the effects of destroying the suprachiasmatic nuclei in female rats, which results in failure of ovulation. The research also examines the animals' sexual behavior and responses to progesterone administration, finding no consistent correlation between these factors and the extent of the lesions. The findings suggest that the failure of ovulation may be related to the disruption of normal diurnal variation in sensitivity to the effects of ovarian steroid hormones.
