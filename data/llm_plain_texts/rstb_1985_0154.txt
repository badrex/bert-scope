tldr: The authors re-examine the wing base articulation and muscle systems of Diptera, proposing a new model for their wing movements and flight mechanics. They demonstrate a direct coupling between the indirect flight muscles and a wing base stop mechanism, and describe the anatomical basis of automatic wing stroke changes during the wingbeat. The study provides a functional characterization of the non-fibrillar muscles and suggests an aerodynamic function for the calypters, structures previously not proposed for this role.
