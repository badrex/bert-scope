tldr: The authors conducted experiments on heavy-section steel to study the effects of phosphorus and size on notched-bend tests. They found that as the tensile proof stress of the steel increased, the fracture load in notched bending decreased. The results showed that the nominal fracture stress was affected by the phosphorus content and the size of the bend test specimen. The authors also discussed the stress distribution and strains in the bars at the moment of fracture.
