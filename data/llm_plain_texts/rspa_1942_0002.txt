tldr: This paper investigates the validity of Laplace's differential equations for ocean tides, considering the assumptions made and their impact on the equations' accuracy. The author compares Laplace's equations to a more general theory, finding that they provide a high degree of approximation in most cases, but may not be valid for certain specific scenarios.
