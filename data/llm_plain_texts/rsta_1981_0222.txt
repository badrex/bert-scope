tldr: The article discusses laboratory studies of isotope exchange in ion-neutral reactions and their implications for interstellar chemistry. The author presents experimental data obtained using the selected ion flow tube (SIFT) technique, focusing on hydrogen-deuterium exchange reactions. The results provide insights into the formation of deuterated molecules and help estimate the electron density and temperature in interstellar clouds. The study has significant implications for understanding the nuclear history of the galaxy and the physical conditions within interstellar clouds.
