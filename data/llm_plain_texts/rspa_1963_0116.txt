tldr: The authors investigate the excitation of atmospheric oscillations by the direction of incoming radiation absorbed by atmospheric ozone. They find that the solar semidiurnal oscillation is much larger than previously considered thermal mechanisms, and that the observed values at ground level can be adequately explained by the direct absorption of insolation by ozone and water vapor. The seasonal variations of the semidiurnal and terdiurnal tides are also calculated and found to agree well with observations.
