tldr: The author conducted a series of experiments on dogs to understand the role of kidneys in metabolism and the impact of kidney disease on the body. They found that removing a portion of the kidney caused minimal immediate effects, but removing both kidneys led to significant nutritional disturbances, including extreme wasting, increased urine production, and a rise in nitrogenous extractions in the tissues. This research provided valuable insights into the importance of healthy kidneys for overall health and well-being.
