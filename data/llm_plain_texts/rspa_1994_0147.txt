tldr: The authors determine the range of the first two eigenvalues of the Laplacian in planar domains, finding that the boundary consists of semi-infinite straight lines and a curve connecting their endpoints. They also show how to minimize the nth eigenvalue when the minimizing domain is disconnected and apply this to various shapes and configurations.
