tldr: The article discusses the historical context and contributions of Robert Boyle in the field of desalination. Boyle's work on the saltness of the sea and his experiments on distillation led him to propose methods for obtaining fresh water from salt water. This research had significant implications for navigation and the well-being of sailors during long sea voyages. The article also highlights the efforts of other inventors, such as Drebbel and Kuffler, who attempted to commercialize similar water distillation machines.
