tldr: The author investigates the Earth's free nutation and its relation to tidal resistance. They discuss the modern investigation of the Earth's axis of rotation as a physical problem and the role of elastic yielding of the Earth's material in response to forces like centrifugal force and tidal influences. The author also examines the connection between the free precession of the Earth and its rigidity, concluding that the internal terrestrial constitution is not involved in these phenomena, except in determining the surface effects arising from a given tidal or rotational stress.
