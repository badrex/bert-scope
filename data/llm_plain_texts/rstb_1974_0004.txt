tldr: The study examines the low terrace at Wretton, Norfolk, which consists of up to 6 meters of fluviatile sands and gravels of Devensian age. The terrace contains organic horizons rich in plant remains, molluscs, and bones, as well as periglacial structures like involutions and ice-wedge casts. The complex succession within the terrace allows for a synthesis of the environmental changes that accompanied terrace formation. The analysis of pollen and macroscopic plant remains reveals a sequence of pollen assemblage biozones, indicating periods of grassland, birch-pine woodland, and pine-birch-spruce woodland. The molluscan faunas found at several horizons are typical of Early Devensian deposits in other parts of the Fenland drainage basin. The study provides insights into the climate, vegetation, and environmental changes during the Late Pleistocene period.
