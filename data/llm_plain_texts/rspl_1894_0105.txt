tldr: This article examines J.B. Hannay's microrheometer experiments on the viscosity of water and compares his results with those of other researchers. The author finds discrepancies in Hannay's data and concludes that it is premature to discuss the effects of dissolved salts on water viscosity based on these experiments.
