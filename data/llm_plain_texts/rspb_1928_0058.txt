tldr: The author investigates the phenomenon of hemolysis, which occurs when serum is added to a system containing red blood cells and the dye brilliant-green. The acceleration of hemolysis depends on the order in which the components are mixed. The study finds that the serum component responsible for the acceleration is a protein, and that each protein fraction produces an effect. The author also explores the physical nature of the sensitization process that occurs when brilliant-green is added to the cell suspension.
