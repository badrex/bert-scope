tldr: The article discusses the structure and evolution of eukaryotic chromosomes and chromatin, focusing on repetitive DNA sequences and their localization in specific regions of the chromosome set. The author reviews the features of arrangement and distribution of repeated sequences in animal chromosomes, including internal repetitiveness, conservation of functional sequences, rapid divergence and fixation of diverged sequence families, and the localization of large blocks of sequences in specific parts of the chromosome set. The author also describes experiments aimed at locating middle repetitive sequences in salamander and newt chromosomes using hybridization techniques.
