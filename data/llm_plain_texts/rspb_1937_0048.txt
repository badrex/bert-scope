tldr: The author investigates the connections of the arcuate nucleus of the thalamus in macaque monkeys. They find that the arcuate nucleus is connected to the postcentral gyrus, which is involved in sensory processing, rather than the precentral gyrus, which is associated with motor control. This challenges the previous assumption that the arcuate nucleus is related to motor functions.
