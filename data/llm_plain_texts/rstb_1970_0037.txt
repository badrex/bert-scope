tldr: The author explores the organization and properties of reflecting surfaces in marine animals, specifically focusing on the reflecting system in fish scales, light-producing organs, and the eye of the scallop. The reflecting surfaces are made of stacks of thin, flat crystals composed of guanine and hypoxanthine, which are oriented and arranged to serve various functions, such as camouflage and illumination. The author also discusses the interference and polarization properties of these reflecting surfaces, as well as their potential industrial applications.
