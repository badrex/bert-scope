tldr: The author, Charles Wheatstone, explores the phenomenon of binocular vision and how our eyes perceive depth and three-dimensional objects. He discovered that when two perspective projections of the same object are presented to each eye, the mind perceives a single, three-dimensional figure. Wheatstone also invented the stereoscope, an instrument that allows for the accurate representation of 3D objects by combining the two separate images from each eye.
