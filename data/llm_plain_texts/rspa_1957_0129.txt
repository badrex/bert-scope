tldr: The authors studied the viscosity behavior of dilute solutions of a strong polyelectrolyte, polystyrene sulphonate. They found that the reduced viscosity reaches a maximum at certain concentrations and decreases at lower concentrations. The study examines the effects of added salts and the degree of dissociation of the polyelectrolyte on the viscosity. The authors also discuss the methods of fractionation and the stability of the polyelectrolyte in solid and solution forms.
