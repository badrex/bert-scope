tldr: The article discusses various methods of immobilizing cells for industrial and diagnostic purposes. It covers techniques such as aggregation, adsorption, and entrapment within gels. The use of immobilized cells has potential in the production of L-malic acid, L-aspartic acid, and steroid conversions. The article also highlights the criteria for successful cell immobilization and compares immobilized cell processes with alternative methods like batch or continuous fermentation, enzyme processes, and chemical or agricultural processes.
