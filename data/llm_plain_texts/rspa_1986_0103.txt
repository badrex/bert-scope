tldr: The authors present a nonlinear wave theory to describe the development of surface morphology during the erosion of solids induced by ion bombardment. They use first-order nonlinear wave theory to explain the formation of surface gradient discontinuities and provide examples of practical importance that illustrate the theory. This theory has applications in surface analysis, ion beam processing, and microfabrication.
