tldr: The authors present a new mathematical form for the adiabatic equation of state for detonation products based on statistical mechanics and intermolecular forces. They use a rational function form for the adiabatic gamma coefficient and fit it to results from an ideal detonation code. The method is applied to pentaerythritol tetranitrate, and the new equations are compared with the Jones-Wilkins-Lee equation. This approach provides a more accurate and flexible representation of the adiabatic equation for detonation products.
