tldr: The authors studied the effects of alkylating agents on the inactivation of T2 bacteriophage and found that inactivation continued even after removing the agents. They discovered that monofunctional and bifunctional compounds caused different inactivation patterns, with monofunctional compounds breaking down more rapidly. The results provide insights into the biological response to alkylating agents and their potential relevance to cancer research.
