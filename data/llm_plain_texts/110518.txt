tldr: The author's research on germination reveals that during this process, alcohol is produced, and oxygen combines with olefiant gas under the influence of the radicle and plumula. Seeds can absorb water depending on temperature, and germination is an action between olefiant gas and atmospheric oxygen, regulated by the plumula and rootlets. This decomposition and combination of elements continue as long as there is farinaceous matter to decompose, laying the foundation for the diverse species of plants.
