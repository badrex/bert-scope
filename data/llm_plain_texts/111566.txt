tldr: The author examines the microscopic structure of fish bones and discovers two distinct types of skeletal structures in osseous fishes. One type contains bone-corpuscles, while the other has a structureless, osteoid composition. The author also observes variations in bone structure within different fish tribes and discusses the implications of these findings for systematic zoology and the identification of fossil remains.
