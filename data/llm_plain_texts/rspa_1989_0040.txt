tldr: The authors explore the presence of fractal patterns in phase separation systems, such as borosilicate glasses and micellar solutions, using scattering techniques. They discuss the role of fractal geometry in understanding the structure and behavior of these systems, and review the expected scattering profiles for different phase separation models. The findings suggest that fractal concepts can help describe the transition from single-phase to two-phase regimes in phase separation processes.
