tldr: The authors explore the high-energy behavior of string scattering and the potential breakdown of space-time at superplanckian energies. They discuss the existence of a large symmetry in string theory that is restored at short distances and the need to go beyond perturbation theory to understand the dynamics of string theory and pick the unique vacuum that matches the real world.
