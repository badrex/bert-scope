tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effect of root-excretions on crop rotation and soil composition. They found that the deterioration of crops on repetition is mainly due to the less ready supply of inorganic ingredients required for their constitution. The author also discovered that the availability of these ingredients in the soil depends on their solubility and the presence of organic matter in the soil. This research provides valuable insights for farmers to improve crop productivity by understanding the soil's chemical composition and managing it effectively.
