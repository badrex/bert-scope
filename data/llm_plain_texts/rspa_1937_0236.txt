tldr: The authors developed a new calorimeter to measure the number of atomic hydrogen produced in a gas discharge. They used this calorimeter to study the factors affecting the yield of atomic hydrogen and to investigate the connection between discharge conditions and the number of atoms produced per unit time. The calorimeter was capable of high accuracy, with sensitivity adjustable over a wide range, and allowed for continuous readings.
