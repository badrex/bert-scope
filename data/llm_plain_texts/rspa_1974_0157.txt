tldr: This article presents a simple isotropic model to explain how downgoing whistlers excite the Earth-ionosphere waveguide. The study focuses on the mathematical techniques and physical interpretations of the results, which are applicable to a more realistic model. The findings show that the incident wave's spatial confinement plays a crucial role in the wave's behavior and excitation of the waveguide.
