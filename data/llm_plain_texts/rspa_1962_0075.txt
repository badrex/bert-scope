tldr: The article explores the concept of general multiplicative population chains, which are populations where each individual is in a state belonging to a fixed set of states. The study focuses on the probability distribution of the first generation conditional on ancestors in states and extends the basic results concerning single-state multiplicative chains to general multiplicative population chains. The article also discusses mean distributions, extinction probabilities, and variance-covariance distributions in these population chains.
