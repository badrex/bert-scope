tldr: The authors discuss the low-Froude-number approximation in free-surface hydrodynamics, which leads to divergent series in powers of the Froude number. They explore the properties of these divergent series for various types of two-dimensional flows and demonstrate that the divergence is of exponential-integral character. The authors propose a method to sum the series using suitable nonlinear iterative transformations, providing accurate solutions even for moderately large Froude numbers.
