tldr: This article discusses the existence of an immunological buffer zone at the interface between maternal and fetal tissues during gestation. It explores the role of placental hormones, such as human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) and human chorionic somatomammotrophin (HCS), in inhibiting the maternal immune system and maintaining the survival of the trophoblast during pregnancy.
