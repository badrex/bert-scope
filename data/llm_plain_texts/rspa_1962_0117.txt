tldr: This article investigates the impact of air drag on satellite orbits with high eccentricities, deriving equations that show how perigee distance and orbital period change with eccentricity during the satellite's lifetime. The study also relates eccentricity to time and provides formulae for the lifetime and air density at perigee, considering the effects of luni-solar gravitational perturbations and solar radiation pressure. The results are presented graphically and their implications and limitations are discussed.
