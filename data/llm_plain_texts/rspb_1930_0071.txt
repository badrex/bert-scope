tldr: The authors studied the porphyrin structure of component c of cytochrome and its relationship to other porphyrins. They found that cytochrome c contains a unique porphyrin, different from ordinary haematoporphyrin, which can be converted into protoporphyrin. This discovery supports the theory that cytochrome is derived from the protohaematin present in cells of aerobic organisms.
