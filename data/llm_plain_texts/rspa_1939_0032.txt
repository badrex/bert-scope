tldr: The authors studied the fluorescence of pure manganese compounds, specifically the halides, and found that only these compounds exhibited fluorescence. They observed a dominating red band in the spectra of these solids, with the fluorescence of the hydrated bromide being the strongest. The authors also investigated the effects of temperature on the fluorescence and the excitation methods used for different compounds.
