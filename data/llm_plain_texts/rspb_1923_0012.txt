tldr: 'The author investigates the irradiation of tactile conditioned reflexes, discovering that reflexes have two phases in their development. In the first phase, reflexes are more or less irradiated, meaning a stimulation of any part of the skin can cause a secretion. In the second phase, the reflex becomes localized and remains so without further alterations. The author also finds that the irradiation of trace reflexes is different, as they remain fully irradiated and can be triggered by any spot on the skin, even those from other receptors.'
