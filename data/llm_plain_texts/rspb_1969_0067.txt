tldr: The article discusses the relationship between the fibrinolytic mechanism and other proteolytic systems in blood plasma. It explores the close integration of the fibrinolytic system with the plasma kinin forming system and how they can be promoted and inhibited independently. The study also highlights the role of factor XII in fibrinolysis and the common enzymic characteristics of plasma proteases involved in clotting, fibrinolysis, kinin formation, and complement functions.
