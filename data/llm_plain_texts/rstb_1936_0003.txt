tldr: The authors studied the reproductive processes of the Bank Vole, a common and widespread British mammal. They observed the oestrous cycle and found that the breeding season lasts from April to October, with a peak in June. The study provides valuable information on the reproductive habits of this species and contributes to understanding the impact of reproduction on the population dynamics of the Bank Vole.
