tldr: This study presents an improved flow method for comparing the specific heats of gases, focusing on air, oxygen, and nitrogen within the temperature range of 20°C to 370°C. The research utilizes a calorimeter with enhanced temperature uniformity and better thermal contact, allowing for more accurate measurements and slower gas flow rates. The results provide a better understanding of the specific heat ratios of these gases at various temperatures.
