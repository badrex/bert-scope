tldr: The authors studied the interaction of atomic particles with solid surfaces at intermediate energies using polycrystalline platinum as a target. They measured the energy and angular distributions of charged particles emitted from the target under hydrogen, sodium, potassium, and hydrocarbon ion bombardment. The results showed that scattering increased with bombarding energy, and the total emission of charged particles was small at lower energies. The findings contribute to the understanding of surface interactions and material properties.
