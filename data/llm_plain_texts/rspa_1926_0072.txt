tldr: The authors studied the thermal decomposition of gaseous acetaldehyde and found it to be a bimolecular reaction. They compared it to the chemically similar unimolecular decomposition of acetone, highlighting the differences in their molecular statistics and activation methods. The results support the conclusion that unimolecular and bimolecular reactions have fundamentally different methods of activation.
