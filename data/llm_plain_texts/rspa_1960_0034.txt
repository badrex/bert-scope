tldr: The authors developed a new method of successive approximation to calculate the fourth virial coefficient for the Lennard-Jones potential, which is useful for understanding intermolecular forces and properties of fluids. The method is suitable for automatic computation and can be applied to other potentials as well. While the accuracy of the calculated values is still being assessed, these values can be used to obtain more accurate experimental values of the lower coefficients.
