tldr: The author examines the atomicity of aluminium and its compounds, discussing the vapour-densities of aluminium ethyle and aluminium methyle. They argue that the molecular formulas for these compounds should be A2 Me6 and Al Et4, and suggest that the deviations from theoretical expectations are due to decomposition or peculiarities in the vapour's constitution. The author emphasizes the importance of trusting in the laws of chemistry and the accumulated knowledge of experimentalists and thinkers.
