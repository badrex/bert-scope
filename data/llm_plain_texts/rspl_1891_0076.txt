tldr: The author discusses the formation of glass in igneous rocks and suggests that water plays a significant role in the process. They argue that the presence of water in magma facilitates the formation of glass during cooling, which explains the rarity of tachylites in nature and their occurrence as "selvages" to basalt masses.
