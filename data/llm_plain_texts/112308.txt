tldr: The author, Frederick W. Pavy, conducted experiments to understand the immunity of the stomach from being digested by its own secretion during life. He found that the stomach can resist digestive attack when the circulation remains free, and the degree of power possessed by the acid contents of the stomach is crucial in determining the outcome. The balance between acid and alkaline substances in the stomach plays a significant role in protecting the organ from self-digestion.
