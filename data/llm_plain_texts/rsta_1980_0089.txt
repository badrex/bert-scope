tldr: This study investigates the impact of minor element concentrations on the strain rate sensitivity and ductility of commercial purity aluminum sheet. The research shows that small increases in solute concentration can change the strain rate sensitivity from positive to negative, affecting the strain to plastic instability. The findings suggest that the sign of the rate sensitivity's variation with strain determines its effect on ductility. The study also highlights the importance of understanding the effects of residual solute levels on aluminum's forming behavior.
