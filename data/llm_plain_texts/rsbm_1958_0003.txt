tldr: 'William Noel Benson was a prominent geologist who made significant contributions to the understanding of geology, paleontology, and tectonics in Australia and New Zealand. His work on the Great Serpentine Belt and the Devonian rocks of western New England laid the foundation for our knowledge of the region. Benson also studied the tectonic conditions accompanying the intrusion of basic and ultrabasic igneous rocks and made important discoveries in the Carboniferous and Cainozoic eras. As a dedicated teacher and researcher, Benson inspired many students and colleagues throughout his career.'
