tldr: This article discusses the importance of strike-slip faults in plate boundaries and their influence on the geological history of the continental lithosphere. It highlights the different types of strike-slip faults, such as ridge transforms, boundary transforms, trench-linked strike-slip faults, and indent-linked strike-slip faults, and their role in forming major lineaments in the Earth's crust. The article emphasizes the need to consider strike-slip displacement as a significant component in the study of orogenic belts and the understanding of Earth's plate tectonics.
