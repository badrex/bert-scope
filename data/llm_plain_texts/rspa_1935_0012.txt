tldr: This article investigates the visco-elastic properties of rubber using an oscillating torsion system. The authors examine the behavior of rubber within the visco-elastic limits and determine the values of the normal visco-elastic constant and the coefficient of normal viscosity. The study provides insights into the dynamical properties of rubber and its potential applications.
