tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the flow of Texas oil in pipes to determine the critical velocity for turbulent flow. They found that the critical velocity for oil was higher than for water, and the resistance to flow was proportional to the square of the velocity. The experiments provided a criterion for determining whether the first or second law of flow should be applied in a particular case.
