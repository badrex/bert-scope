tldr: The author conducted a series of experiments to study the spectrum of the night sky and the auroral spectrum. They used two identical spectrographs to capture the light from the night sky and compared the results with the spectra of the northern and southern horizons. The author found that the aurora line was present in both the northern and southern horizons, and discussed the implications of this finding. Additionally, the author investigated the presence of nitrogen bands in the night sky and the "Northern Lights" at different latitudes.
