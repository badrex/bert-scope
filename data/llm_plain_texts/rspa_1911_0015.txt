tldr: The author investigates the chemical physics behind the precipitation of free carbon from iron-carbon alloys, focusing on the influence of silicon, sulphur, and manganese. The study reveals that these elements affect the composition and dissociation of carbide, altering the precipitation of free carbon in the alloys. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the iron-carbon system and its properties.
