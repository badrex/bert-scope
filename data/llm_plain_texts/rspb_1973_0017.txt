tldr: This study investigates the genetic variation in esterase systems of the Meadow Brown butterfly, Maniola jurtina, in southwest England. The researchers found two polymorphic systems, Es-A and Es-B, with multiple alleles at a single locus. They observed no association between esterase morphology and hind-wing spotting patterns. The geographical patterns in gene and genotype frequencies of both enzyme systems are described, and these patterns are compared with those shown by spot number and spot position. The distribution patterns suggest that the boundary region is a zone of 'genetic disturbance.'
