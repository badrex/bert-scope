tldr: The authors studied the time-dependent deformation and fracture characteristics of Inconel alloy X-750 under uniaxial and biaxial stressing. They discovered unusual behavior, with torsion lifetimes falling outside the region defined by plane-stress isochronous rupture loci. This was due to a large effect of section size on lifetime, caused by a change in creep resistance and a profuse, spatially inhomogeneous cavitation in the near-surface region. The authors speculate that this cavitation was the result of an interaction with the environment during heat treatment.
