tldr: The authors investigated the hydrogen permeation in metals, focusing on the effects of stress, temperature, and dissolved hydrogen concentration. They found that stress does not affect the diffusion coefficient of hydrogen in ferrous metals, but it increases the solubility of hydrogen in the metal lattice. The study also revealed that trace impurities and grain boundaries have negligible effects on the hydrogen permeation rate. The results provide insights into the mechanism of hydrogen embrittlement and stress corrosion cracking in metals.
