tldr: This article presents an interferometer technique for studying diffusion in transparent high polymers and determining concentration distributions. The authors apply this method to the system of chloroform-stretched cellulose acetate, finding that concentration-distance curves consist of two almost linear portions with a significant change in gradient. The technique can be applied to other transparent polymers, providing valuable insights into diffusion processes in polymer systems.
