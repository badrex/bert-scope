tldr: The author, W.J.Macquorn Rankine, investigates the thermodynamic theory of steam-engines using dry saturated steam and its application to practice. He explains the exact formulae for the work of steam in expanding without significant condensation and provides examples of applying these formulae to steam-vessels' engines. The author also discusses the effect of the "steam-jacket" invented by Watt and the heat transfer in steam-engines.
