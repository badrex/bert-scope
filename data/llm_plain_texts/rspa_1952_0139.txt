revised_title: Dielectric Dispersion in Polar Liquids: A Reassessment of Theoretical Models
semantic_tags:
  - Dielectric properties

  - Relaxation time
  - Resonance absorption
  - Dielectric dispersion theory
tldr: This article analyzes the dielectric properties of water, methyl alcohol, and ethyl alcohol at high radio frequencies. The author examines the existing theories of dielectric dispersion and suggests that resonance absorption may play a role in the dispersion observed in these polar liquids. The study finds that a single relaxation time can account for the dispersion in these liquids, and the author proposes a new approach to understanding the dielectric properties of polar liquids.
