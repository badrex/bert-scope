tldr: The authors conducted experiments on various dielectrics, including gutta-percha, india-rubber, and ebonite, to study the relationship between specific resistance and inductive capacity. They found that the specific inductive capacity decreases as the specific resistance increases. The authors also explored the connection between the phenomena of absorption and conduction in dielectrics and the concept of viscosity. This research extended Faraday's stress theory of induction and provided a better understanding of the internal actions taking place in dielectrics.
