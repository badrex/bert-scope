tldr: The authors studied the catalytic hydrogenation of unsaturated fatty oils in the presence of finely disseminated nickel. They found that the process involves the primary formation of an unstable complex between nickel and the unsaturated organic compound. The results showed that the rate of hydrogenation is constant until only about 10-20% of glycerides more unsaturated than olein is left, after which an abrupt change occurs. This discovery has implications for understanding the action of enzymes and the role of surface phenomena in catalytic reactions.
