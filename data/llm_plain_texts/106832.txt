tldr: 'Henry Cavendish, using observations from multiple locations, estimates the height of the luminous arch seen on February 23, 1784. He suggests that the arch could have been between 52 and 71 statute miles above the surface of the earth. Cavendish also proposes a hypothesis that these arches may consist of parallel streams of light forming a long, thin band.'
