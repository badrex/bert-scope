tldr: Thomas Young developed a finite and exact expression for the refraction of an atmosphere similar to Earth's. He found that by representing the pressure of the atmosphere as the cube of the square root of the density, he could accurately calculate the astronomical refraction. This method agreed closely with existing tables and the Nautical Almanac. However, Young noted that there was no need to create a new table using this formula, as the method used for the Nautical Almanac was more efficient in most cases.
