tldr: The authors developed a rapid method for determining diffusion constants in solutions using interference patterns. This method allows for quicker and more accurate measurements of diffusion constants, especially for high molecular substances. The technique involves creating a sharp initial boundary between a dilute solution and a solvent and observing the interference pattern formed by monochromatic light passing through the diffusion process. This method can be particularly useful for studying the diffusion of single homogeneous solutes.
