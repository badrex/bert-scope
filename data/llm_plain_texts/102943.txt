tldr: Francis Hauksbee conducted an experiment to understand why the mercury in barometers descends during storms. He observed that the mercury in the barometer subsided and showed a visible vibration during a violent storm. Hauksbee designed an apparatus to demonstrate this phenomenon, which involved a syphon, a swan-neck pipe, and two barometers. The experiment showed that the descent of mercury in the barometer was due to the lessened pressure of the atmosphere, and as the air current weakened, the atmospheric pressure increased, causing the mercury to ascend.
