tldr: This article explores the interaction between adapted and unadapted strains of coliform bacteria. The study reveals that a mutual influence exists between the strains, primarily involving simple metabolites and requiring specific conditions for effective transfer. The findings suggest that simple metabolites play a major role in the phenomenon, with good aeration and inoculum size being crucial factors for the interaction.
