tldr: The author, Anthony van Leeuwenhoek, observed the white matter on his tongue during a fever and conducted experiments using a microscope. He discovered that the white matter was not caused by external substances but was protruded from the tongue itself. The white matter had a fibrous structure and appeared to be composed of small particles that could be observed under a microscope. This discovery challenged the common belief that the whiteness on the tongue was caused by ascending vapors from the stomach or fumes from the head.
