tldr: The author, Benjamin Thompson, conducted experiments to measure the comparative intensities of light emitted by luminous bodies. He used a photometer to compare the light from different sources and found that the intensity of light diminished in a ratio less than the squares of the distances. The author concluded that the resistance of air to light was negligible and suggested further experiments to measure the resistance more accurately.
