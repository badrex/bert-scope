tldr: This study investigates the phylogeny and evolution of British Silurian Rugose Corals with Acanthine Septa. The research focuses on the coral skeleton's microscopic structure and the conditions of life under which these corals lived. The author emphasizes the importance of studying all possible characters at different stratigraphical horizons to understand the complex and interwoven processes of evolution. The study also highlights the significance of septal structure as an evolving character in the Silurian and Devonian families of corals.
