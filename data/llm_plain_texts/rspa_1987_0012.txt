tldr: A systematic study was conducted on the collapse of displacement cascades in the Cu3Au alloy using transmission electron microscopy. The research focused on factors affecting the collapse of displacement cascades at different irradiation temperatures. The findings showed that collapse occurred with a high probability at both low and room temperatures, with an increase in collapse probability observed with ion mass. The results provide insights into the understanding of vacancy motion within cascades and their impact on the evolution of the damage structure.
