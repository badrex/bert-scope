tldr: The authors studied the more refrangible band system of cyanogen in active nitrogen. They observed modifications in the development of the bands and discussed the possible explanations for these changes. The study provides insights into the behavior of molecules in different environments and contributes to the understanding of molecular physics and chemistry.
