tldr: The author examines the structure and development of narwhale tusks, discovering that both male and female narwhales have tusks, but they develop at different rates and lengths. The tusks are made of solid bone and have a hollow tube in the middle. This research helps clarify misconceptions about narwhale anatomy and suggests that the name given to the species by Linnaeus is improper.
