tldr: The authors study radially symmetric solutions of a nonlinear elliptic partial differential equation with critical Sobolev growth, which arises from various areas in theoretical physics, including superconductivity, cosmology, and the self-dual Chern-Simons theory. They find necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of self-dual cosmic string solutions and explore the implications for physical problems.
