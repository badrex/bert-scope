tldr: The author, Henry Foster, conducted experiments with an invariable pendulum at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich and Port Bowen to measure the rate of a clock and determine the latitude of Port Bowen. The experiments involved precise observations of the pendulum's vibrations, taking into account various factors such as temperature, elevation, and buoyancy. The results allowed the author to calculate the ellipticity of the Earth and improve timekeeping and navigation.
