tldr: The authors discuss an initial-boundary value problem in electromagnetic theory using the Harmuth ansatz and Beltrami-Moses fields. They present a manifestly covariant electromagnetic formalism and demonstrate how it can be used to solve electromagnetic problems with initial-boundary conditions. This approach offers a more compact and suitable method for utilizing Beltrami fields in electromagnetism.
