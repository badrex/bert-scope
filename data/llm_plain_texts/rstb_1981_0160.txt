tldr: This article discusses a theory of pattern formation in biological systems, specifically focusing on the role of ionic currents in establishing developmental patterns. The author proposes that ion leaks and pumps are segregated during patterning, generating ionic currents that act back to further segregate these components and ultimately generate prepatterns. The theory is supported by evidence from various biological systems, including fucoid eggs, silkworm follicles, and regenerating limbs.
