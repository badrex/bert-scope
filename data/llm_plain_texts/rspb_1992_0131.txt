tldr: The authors discovered that lipoxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid can activate the retinoid X receptor (RXR-y) in chick cells. Molecular modeling predicts conformational similarities between some lipoxygenase products and retinoic acid. This finding suggests that eicosanoids, which act as local hormones and intracellular second messengers, may also play a direct role in transcriptional activation via nuclear receptors.
