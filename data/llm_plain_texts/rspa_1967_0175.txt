tldr: The authors conducted a study on the viscoelastic properties of low molecular weight poly-1-butenes under cyclic shearing stress. They found that the behavior of these liquids can be described by a simple phenomenological model for viscoelastic relaxation. The results show that increasing chain length affects the transition from pure liquid to polymer liquid behavior.
