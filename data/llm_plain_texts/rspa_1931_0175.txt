tldr: The author presents a method to measure surface tension in liquids using a micrometer syringe. The technique can also be applied to observe the changes in surface tension in newly-formed surfaces of hydrophilic colloid solutions and saponin solutions. The slow changes in surface tension are attributed to diffusion of molecules, while rapid changes are due to changes in concentration.
