tldr: The author, Lieut. J. H. Hennessey, conducted observations of the solar spectrum and atmospheric lines using a spectroscope in Mussoorie, India. They discovered that the atmospheric lines become more visible when the sun is close to the horizon, and made a map of the solar spectrum, including the region from the extreme red to the lines D. The author also discussed the challenges faced during the observations and the differences in the spectrum compared to previous observations.
