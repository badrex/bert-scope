tldr: The authors developed a new instrument to measure low magnetic susceptibility, which allows for a wider range of magnetic force measurement and improved accuracy compared to the Curie balance. The instrument uses an electromagnet and a moving coil to create a magnetic field and measure the mechanical force exerted on the specimen. This innovation enables the study of magnetic properties in various materials and contributes to a better understanding of their behavior.
