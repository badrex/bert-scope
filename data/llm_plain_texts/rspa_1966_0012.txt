tldr: The authors studied the gas phase reactions of methylene with various organic halides, such as methyl chloride and ethyl chloride. They found that methylene reacts with these halides by abstracting a chlorine or hydrogen atom, forming radicals that can give rise to different products. The research aimed to establish whether insertion or abstraction processes predominate in these reactions. The findings contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms involved in the gas phase reactions of methylene with organic halides.
