tldr: The authors studied the vacuum spark spectra of heavier elements and classified series in the spectra of ionised atoms homologous with copper, silver, and gold. They used two methods of excitation and photography to obtain the spectra and measured the wave-lengths accurately. The main challenge was identifying series lines in these rich and complex spectra, which often had overlapping lines and small measurement errors.
