tldr: This article investigates the hydromagnetic flow of a conducting fluid near a magnetic neutral line. The two-dimensional motion of a cylinder of perfectly conducting liquid in a permanent magnetic field is studied. The liquid is uniform, incompressible, and frictionless. The motion is governed by the force exerted on the electric current by the magnetic field, permanent and induced. The results show that a small motion near the magnetic neutral line will grow indefinitely, with magnetic energy being converted into kinetic energy. This non-linear hydromagnetic problem is completely soluble, and the initial conditions can be chosen in various ways.
