tldr: The article describes the amphibian Crassigyrinus scoticus, a primitive species from the Carboniferous period. The author analyzes the skull, dermal skull roof, parasphenoid and braincase, palate, lower jaw, dentition, and postcranial skeleton of the species. Crassigyrinus shares some characteristics with anthracosaur amphibia, but also has primitive features, making it an important species for understanding the evolution of early tetrapods.
