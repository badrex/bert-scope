tldr: The study investigates the role of laminin in the regeneration of axons in the leech central nervous system. It shows that laminin, a glycoprotein molecule, accumulates at injury sites and is closely associated with regenerating axons. Microglial cells also accumulate at the injury site, suggesting that laminin may promote axonal growth in the leech central nervous system, as it does in culture.
