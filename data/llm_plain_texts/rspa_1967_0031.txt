tldr: The authors used high-resolution radio telescopes to study the radio brightness distribution and properties of the Moon's surface layer. They observed a decrease in surface temperature from the equator to the poles and estimated the effective dielectric constant and density of the surface layer. The results provide insights into the Moon's surface homogeneity and help understand its thermal properties.
