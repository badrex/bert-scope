tldr: The authors propose a new approach to modeling pharmacological agonism, focusing on the observation that agonist concentration-effect curves are commonly hyperbolic. They develop a general model that explicitly describes agonism with three parameters: an agonist-receptor dissociation constant, the total receptor concentration, and a parameter defining the transduction of the agonist-receptor complex into pharmacological effect. This model offers a more straightforward and chemically grounded understanding of agonist action, providing a foundation for future research in pharmacology.
