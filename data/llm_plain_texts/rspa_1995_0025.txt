tldr: This article explores light propagation in helicoidal bianisotropic mediums, which include liquid crystals, cross-linked polymer networks, and solid thin films. The authors derive solutions for axial propagation in these mediums and demonstrate their use in obtaining the plane-wave response of a slab. The study exemplifies the analytical results through applications to four mediums.
