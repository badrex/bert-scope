tldr: The authors conducted an experiment to measure the neutron-proton capture cross-section using boron-loaded photographic emulsion as a neutron detector. They found a ratio of the cross-sections of boron and hydrogen, which helped determine the cross-section of hydrogen for capture of thermal neutrons. This research contributed to understanding the range of nuclear forces in the singlet state of the neutron-proton system and testing the hypothesis of charge independence of nuclear forces.
