tldr: The author, Albany Hancock, examines the anatomy and classification of Brachiopoda, a group of marine animals with a shell consisting of two valves. He investigates the organization, muscles, arms, and reproductive systems of various species, including Waldheimia, Terebratulina, Rhynchonella, and Lingula. Hancock also discusses the differences between articulated and non-articulated Brachiopoda and the existence of an anal aperture in these species. This research contributes to the understanding of the evolution and classification of Brachiopoda.
