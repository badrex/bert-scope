tldr: The author conducted magnetic inclination observations during the voyage of H.M.S. Iron Duke, visiting China, Japan, and surrounding areas between 1871 and 1875. Using a dip circle, the author recorded the magnetic needle's dip at various locations to determine the magnetic inclination and compare it with previous observations. These observations helped in understanding the changes in the Earth's magnetic field and its impact on navigation.
