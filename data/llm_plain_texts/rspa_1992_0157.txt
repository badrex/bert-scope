tldr: The authors demonstrate a new approach to achieve time-invariant diffusional flux through bilayered membranes with reversible barriers. They exploit the phenomenon of volume transition in polymers to form bilayers that can be created in situ. The desired diffusional behavior can be achieved by manipulating transport parameters, and the concept's validity and quantitative predictability are demonstrated through experimentation on model systems.
