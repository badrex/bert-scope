tldr: The author conducted experiments on the spectra of various carbon compounds and found a relationship between the temperature and the resulting spectra. They observed that the blue line and flutings in the spectra correspond to different temperature levels, with the blue line representing the highest temperature and the blue flutings the lowest. This discovery helped in understanding the molecular grouping of carbon compounds.
