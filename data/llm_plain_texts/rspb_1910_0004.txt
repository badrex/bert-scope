tldr: The authors conducted a study on the brain of the marmoset, examining its cortical lamination and localization. They found differences in the extent and boundaries of various types of cortex, such as the motor area, postcentral type, and temporal area, which can be correlated with the animal's morphology, mode of life, and habits. The study provides insights into the correlation of structure and function in the marmoset brain.
