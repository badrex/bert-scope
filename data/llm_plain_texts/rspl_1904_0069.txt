tldr: The author investigates the rate of change in enzyme action, specifically with sucroclastic enzymes, and its relation to the law of mass action. They found that the rate of change is influenced by the concentration of the sugar solution and the presence of the products of hydrolysis. This study provides insights into the complex nature of enzyme action and its deviation from the law of mass action.
