revised_title: Diamagnetism and Free Electrons in Metals
semantic_tags:
  - Diamagnetism
  - Electromagnetism
  - Free electrons
  - Metal properties
  - Quantum theory
tldr: The author explains how the presence of free electrons in a metal can produce diamagnetic susceptibility, which is the ability of a material to be slightly repelled by a magnetic field. The author also discusses the relationship between the number of free electrons and the susceptibility of metals, as well as the influence of temperature on this property.
