tldr: The authors studied the polymerization of methyl methacrylate using the viscosity method and found it to be a normal radical chain process. They discovered that irradiation of methyl methacrylate by ultra-violet light produces a catalyst, while a thermal reaction forms an inhibitor. These findings explain the difficulties experienced by other researchers and account for the anomalous polymerization observed by Melville. The authors also investigated chain termination in the polymerization of styrene and methyl methacrylate, showing that it occurs through disproportionation.
