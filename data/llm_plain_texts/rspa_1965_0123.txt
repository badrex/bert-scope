tldr: The authors investigated the structure of mesomorphic phases using electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. They examined surface-active compounds like sodium 2-ethylhexyl sulphate and sodium di-2-ethylhexyl sulphosuccinate, which exist in the mesomorphic state in a high vacuum. The results showed that both neat and middle mesomorphic phases possess stepped growth patterns, and the step-height measurements agree with the interlayer spacings determined by low-angle X-ray diffraction. This study confirms the mesomorphic phase structure deduced from X-ray diffraction data and provides insights into the structures of these phases in biological systems containing lipid materials.
