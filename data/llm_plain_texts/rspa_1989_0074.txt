tldr: This paper explores the duality structure present in the semigeostrophic equations of meteorology, focusing on the Legendre transformations between alternative choices of independent variables, such as space coordinates, geostrophic coordinates, and isentropic coordinates. The authors provide detailed examples of modeling atmospheric fronts at a given time in stable flow, using a quartet of Legendre transformations to represent the front as a half-line of gradient discontinuity on a continuous convex surface.
