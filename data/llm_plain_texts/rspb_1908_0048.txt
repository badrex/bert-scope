tldr: This article investigates the reproductive system of Welwitschia, a unique plant species found in Damaraland. The author examines the presence of macrospores and embryo-sacs in the female cone-axis, confirming that the ovule is cauline. The author also suggests that the female cone and male flower may have evolved from an amphisporangiate strobilus similar to Bennettites. Additionally, the article discusses the similarities and differences between Welwitschia, Gnetum, and Ephedra in terms of endosperm formation and embryo development. Lastly, the author proposes that Welwitschia is the most specialized living representative of its evolutionary lineage.
