tldr: The article discusses the photoelectron spectra and ionization potentials of carbonyl halides (fluoride, chloride, and bromide) and carbonyl cyanide. The results help assign ionization potentials to various molecular orbitals, including lone pairs of electrons on halogen, oxygen, or nitrogen atoms, and those involving electrons in C=O bonds. The findings are correlated with chemical reactivity and compared to other data from far ultraviolet and electron impact spectra.
