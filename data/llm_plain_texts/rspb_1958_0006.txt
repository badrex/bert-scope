tldr: The author's study investigates protein selection in the yolk-sac splanchnopleur of the rabbit and the total uptake estimated as loss from the uterus. They found that the non-gravid uterus in pregnancy takes up a fraction of the injected dose, with appearance of labelled protein in the maternal bloodstream. The study also suggests that proteins are taken up by the foetal cell equally, with a small part passing on into the foetal circulation as protein and the remainder being broken down.
