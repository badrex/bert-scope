tldr: The author examines the stability of fluid motion and turbulence using the energy method introduced by Reynolds and modified by Orr. They analyze various types of flow under different boundary conditions and discuss the implications of their findings on fluid dynamics and hydrodynamics. The study highlights the importance of understanding the behavior of fluids in various situations, such as open canals and pipes.
