tldr: The author, Francis Robartes, discusses the proportion of mathematical points and their applications. He refutes the common belief that all infinites are equal and provides examples of infinite quantities in a determinate finite proportion. The author also explores the relationship between points of contact between circles and tangents, as well as between spheres and planes.
