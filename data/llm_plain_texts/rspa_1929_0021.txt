tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate the sensitivity of the eye in counting scintillations produced by alpha particles. They studied factors such as the duration of the flashes, the amount of energy required to produce a visual sensation, and the influence of the retinal image size on the counting process. Their findings provide a better understanding of the scintillation counting method and its limitations.
