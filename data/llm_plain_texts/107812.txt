tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the reaction between sulfuric acid and alcohol, leading to the discovery of a new compound. The author found that alcohol reacts with sulfuric acid to form a compound containing carbon, hydrogen, and sulfur. This compound can unite with salifiable bases and form a series of products. The author also observed that alcohol can reduce the saturation power of sulfuric acid, which has implications for the formation of salts.
