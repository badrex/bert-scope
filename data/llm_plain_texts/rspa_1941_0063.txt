tldr: The authors develop a formula for the neighbour distribution function in monatomic liquids and dense gases, assuming that each atom vibrates in the field of its neighbors when in their equilibrium positions. They apply this formula to potassium and show how interatomic fields can be derived from the distribution function of a single shell of neighbors, determined from experiment.
