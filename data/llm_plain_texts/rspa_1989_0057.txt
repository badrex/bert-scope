tldr: This article proposes improvements to statistical energy analysis (SEA) for periodic structures, which are commonly found in engineering applications such as off-shore platforms, box girder bridges, and satellites. The authors enhance SEA models by incorporating calculations of pass bands for typical elements of periodic structures, allowing for a more accurate representation of the non-uniform distribution of natural frequencies in these structures. This new approach provides better predictions for energy flow and can be applied to a wide range of geometrically periodic structures.
