tldr: The authors investigate the efficiency of K series emission in K ionized atoms using X-ray spectroscopy. They propose the concept of "internal absorption" to explain the low efficiency of series emission and provide experimental evidence to support their hypothesis. The study contributes to the understanding of atomic processes and radiation interactions.
