tldr: This article discusses the limitations of molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth process on the performance of double-barrier resonant tunnelling (DBRT) structures. It explores ways to optimize the MBE process and choose appropriate materials systems to improve device performance. The authors also address the effects of interface roughness and the influence of the materials system on device performance.
