tldr: This study examines the growth, form, and life history of Plumularia setacea, a marine hydroid, in two different habitats. In one habitat, the hydroids grow on the hydroid Nemertesia antennina and have a shorter life span of 3-4 months. In the other habitat, they grow on concrete substrata and reproduce only from June to August. The study shows that the hydroids adapt their growth and reproduction patterns to survive in these contrasting environments.
