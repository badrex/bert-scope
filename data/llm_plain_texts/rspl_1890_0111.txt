tldr: The authors, Silvanus P. Thompson and G. Carey Foster, investigate the phenomena of galvano-hysteresis and discharge currents in soft iron wires. They discovered that when a strong electric current is passed through a coil of insulated soft iron wire, and the wire is later placed in a circuit with a galvanometer, it discharges an electric current. The direction of the discharge current is opposite to that of the original current, and the time-integral of the discharge current is independent of the duration of the charging current. The authors believe these phenomena are related to the production and disappearance of circular magnetization, similar to those observed by Villari and Hughes.
