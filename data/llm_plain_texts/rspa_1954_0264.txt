tldr: The authors used reflexion electron microscopy to study the shape, surface structure, and frictional wear of various fibres, such as orlon, viscose rayon, cellulose acetate, glass wool, and nylon. This technique provided better resolution and depth of field compared to conventional optical methods, allowing for a more accurate evaluation of fibre shape and surface structure. The authors also investigated the deformation and damage caused by sliding on single fibres of drawn nylon.
