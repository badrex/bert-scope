tldr: The authors introduce a new bond order potential that accounts for the angular character of bonding orbitals in intermetallics, particularly transition metal aluminides. This potential can explain the negative Cauchy pressure of cubic metals and the oscillatory behavior of three-body cluster interactions in the transition metal aluminide series. The potential can be used to investigate the relative stability of different crystal structures and predict the behavior of intermetallic materials.
