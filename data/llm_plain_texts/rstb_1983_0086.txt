revised_title: Overcoming Non-Specific Defenses in Viral Pathogenicity
semantic_tags:
  - Viral pathogenicity
  - Non-specific defenses
  - Fever
  - Macrophages
  - Thermoresistance
tldr: This article discusses how viruses can overcome non-specific defenses in the host, such as fever and macrophages, to increase their pathogenicity. It also explores the role of interferon as a mediator of non-specific defense mechanisms and the interaction of viruses with Kupffer cells in the liver. The study highlights the importance of thermoresistance and its correlation with virulence in various viruses.
