tldr: The author studied the morphology and development of sporangia in all four living genera of Marattiaceae, including Angiopteris, Dancea, Marattia, and Kaulfussia. They found that the sporangia have a substantial unity of type in their development and that the Eusporangiate condition is best adapted for maturing large numbers of spores. The author also discussed the theoretical question of whether synangia are a result of coalescence of sporangia, leaving the question open for further discussion.
