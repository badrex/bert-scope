tldr: The authors calculate the Lamb shift of a tightly bound electron in mercury using a method described in a preceding paper. They find the Lamb shift to be 38 Ry, which, when combined with other theoretical calculations, results in a theoretical binding energy of -6099 Ry. This value can be compared with the experimental value of 6109 Ry for the K-absorption edge. The authors discuss other contributions of order that have not been evaluated in this paper but plan to calculate them in the future.
