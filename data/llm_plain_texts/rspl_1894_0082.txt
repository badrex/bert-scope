tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effects of magnetisation on the dimensions of iron rings and the changes in their volume. The results showed that magnetisation causes both annealed and hardened iron rings to change width and volume. The annealed ring contracts when magnetised, while the hardened ring expands and then contracts with larger forces. These findings contribute to the understanding of the relationship between magnetisation and material properties.
