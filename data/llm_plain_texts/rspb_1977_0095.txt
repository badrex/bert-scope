tldr: This article discusses the role of egg cytoplasm and cytoplasmic determinants in controlling gene expression and cell differentiation during early development. It explores the concept of determinants, which are molecules that commit cells to differentiate in a certain way, and their relationship to specific cell types. The article also reviews the evidence for the constancy of the genome during development and the role of nuclear transplantation in testing the genetic makeup of specialized cells.
