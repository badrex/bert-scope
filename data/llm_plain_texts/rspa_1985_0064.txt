tldr: This review lecture discusses the development of water waves in space and time, focusing on the nonlinear aspects of wave propagation in shallow and deep water. It covers topics such as soliton solutions, wave breaking, and the role of nonlinear effects in shallow water waves. The lecture also explores the use of mathematical models like the nonlinear Schrodinger equations and the parabolic approximation to understand water waves.
