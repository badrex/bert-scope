tldr: 'This obituary celebrates the life and work of Wilfred Trotter, a renowned surgeon and philosopher who made significant contributions to the understanding of the human mind and behavior. Trotter's unique approach to surgery and his intellectual curiosity led him to explore the herd instinct, a fourth instinct he believed to be present in humans, which influenced their feelings and intellectual processes. His work in psychology and sociology, as well as his influence on the medical field, is remembered and honored.'
