tldr: The Royal Society of London discusses the potential scientific observations that can be conducted in India, focusing on the total solar eclipse of 1867 and atmospheric research. The committee recommends conducting studies on the brightness of stars, actinometric observations, and spectroscopic analysis of the solar spectrum, including the red protuberances and the corona. They also suggest purchasing telescopes and spectroscopes for these observations.
