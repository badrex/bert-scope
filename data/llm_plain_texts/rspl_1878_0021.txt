tldr: The authors conducted experiments on dogs, rabbits, and frogs to study the effects of alternate stimulation of the vagus nerves on the heart. They found that stimulation of one vagus nerve does not annul or prejudice the inhibiting powers of the other vagus nerve, unless the inhibiting apparatus has been recently under stimulation for some time. This challenges the generally accepted theory of the connection of the vagus nerves with a common intermediate apparatus.
