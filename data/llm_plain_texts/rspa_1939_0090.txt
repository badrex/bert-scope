tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the excitation of y-radiation in processes of proton capture by light elements. They investigated the excitation curves for the intensity of capture y-radiation in elements such as lithium, sodium, magnesium, phosphorus, and chlorine. The results showed various resonances and provided insights into the quantum energies of the emitted radiation. This research contributes to the understanding of nuclear physics and the behavior of elements under proton bombardment.
