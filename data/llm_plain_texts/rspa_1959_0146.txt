tldr: The authors studied the radiation-induced polymerization of isobutene at low temperatures, finding that high polymers were obtained. They discovered that the process is sensitive to surface conditions and may be partially intrinsically heterogeneous. The carbenium ion propagation mechanism is proposed for the polymer chain growth, which can be initiated by primary ion-radicals or carbonium ions. The polymerization is inhibited by di-isobutene, oxygen, and benzoquinone, and the conversion of monomer per unit radiation dose is independent of radiation intensity and increases as the temperature decreases.
