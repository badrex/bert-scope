tldr: The authors measured the heat capacities and adiabatic compressibilities of carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, methylene dibromide, and methyl iodide between -30°C and 30°C. They derived heat capacities at constant volume and found that the heat capacities of these liquids vary differently with temperature. The results provide insights into the molecular motion and structure of liquids, contributing to the understanding of the liquid state of matter.
