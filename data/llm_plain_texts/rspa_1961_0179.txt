tldr: This article demonstrates a method to improve the quality of images obtained with annular apertures by using an optical correction process. The process involves cross-correlating the distorted image with a specially chosen correction function, which can be applied to radio astronomy, specifically in the construction of very large annular aerial arrays for observing astronomical radio-brightness distributions.
