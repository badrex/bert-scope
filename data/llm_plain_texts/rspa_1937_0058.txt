tldr: The authors used X-ray diffraction and Fourier analysis to study the structure of liquid hydrogen peroxide. They found that the liquid has a close-packed face-centered cubic structure, with the hydroxyl (OH) groups having a larger radius than in water. The results also support the Penney-Sutherland model for the orientation of the OH groups, which is consistent with the observed dipole moment of hydrogen peroxide.
