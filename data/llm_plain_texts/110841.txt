tldr: The author conducted experiments to further understand the movement and ascent of sap in plants. He found that the ascending sap is situated in the intercellular and intervascular spaces of the plant and its passage into the cells is affected by the action of endosmose. The author also discovered that plants absorb a larger quantity of fluid when immersed in pure water compared to a solution of gum-arabic. This research contributes to the understanding of plant nutrition and the distribution of fluids within the plant.
