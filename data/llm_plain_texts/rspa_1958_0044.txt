tldr: The authors studied the gas-phase oxidation of propylene between 340 and 400°C. They found that the reaction is a degenerately branched-chain type, with acetaldehyde mainly responsible for branching. The aldehyde is likely produced by the decomposition of a peroxide, which is the initially formed molecular product. The reaction processes and important intermediates and products are discussed, and the authors observed inhibition of certain elementary processes at high hydrocarbon concentrations due to the formation of an unreactive allyl radical.
