tldr: The authors analyze the structure of the helium band spectrum and identify new electronic levels. They discuss the interpretation of these levels using Hund's theory and explain the peculiarities of the rotation terms. The study provides a deeper understanding of the helium band spectrum and its implications for atomic and molecular physics.
