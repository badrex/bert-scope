tldr: The authors cloned and characterized two rat cDNAs corresponding to two alternatively spliced transcripts (KShlllD and KShIIID.1) that express an unusual high-voltage-activating, TEA-sensitive A-type potassium channel. These channels have unique properties that contribute to the functional diversity of A currents in neurons and may play a role in modulating neuronal excitability.
