tldr: The author presents a hypothesis explaining the partial absence of colored pigment in different parts of the human body and other animals. He suggests that it is due to the union or adhesion of the epidermis and true skin, which excludes the rete mucosum. The author supports this hypothesis by comparing it to the colorless appearance of cicatrices in various animals.
