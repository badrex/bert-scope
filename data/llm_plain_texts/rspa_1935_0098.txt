tldr: This study investigates the effect of pressure on the reaction between sodium ethoxide and ethyl iodide. The research finds that the increase in reaction velocity with pressure is not solely due to the concentration increase from solvent compression. The pressure effect remains constant across different temperatures, indicating a consistent mechanism.
