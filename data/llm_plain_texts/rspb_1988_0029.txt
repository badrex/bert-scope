tldr: The study investigates the crystallography and morphology of the celestite skeleton in the acantharian species Phyllostaurus siculus. Using electron microscopy, electron diffraction, and optical microscopy, researchers found that the skeleton is composed of 20 spicules radiating from a central point. The spicules connect via lateral wing structures, and the crystallographic orientations of these wings have been determined. The precise arrangement of the spicules is described in terms of the lateral wing attachments at the cell center, and the effects of crystallographic constraints, spicule packing efficiency, and biological control on spicule arrangement are discussed.
