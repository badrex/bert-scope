tldr: Researchers studied the correlation between fertilization current, calcium waves, and cytoplasmic contraction in eggs of Ciona intestinalis. They found that the fertilization current, calcium wave, and contraction wave occurred in the same direction and that a region of elevated calcium persisted at the animal pole. These findings provide insights into the early events of fertilization and development in ascidian eggs.
