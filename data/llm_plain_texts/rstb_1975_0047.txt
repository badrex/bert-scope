tldr: The article discusses the composition and structure of the pericellular environment in vertebrate tissues, focusing on the role of proteoglycans. It explains how the interactions between fibers and soluble polymers contribute to the mechanical properties and functions of connective tissues. The author also highlights the evolutionary aspect of the pericellular environment and its importance in the development of multicellular organisms.
