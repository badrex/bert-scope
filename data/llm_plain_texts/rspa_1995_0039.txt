tldr: This study investigates the effects of stress wave propagation in split Hopkinson pressure bar tests, which are used to measure material properties at high strain rates. The authors present analytical and numerical simulations that show plastic wave fronts within the specimen can cause discrepancies in flow stress measurements and an apparent increase in strain rate sensitivity. The results suggest that the assumption of uniform stress and strain distribution within a split Hopkinson pressure bar specimen is incorrect at high impact velocities.
