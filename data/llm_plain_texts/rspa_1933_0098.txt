tldr: This article investigates the inhibiting action of oxygen and hydrogen chloride in the formation of hydrogen chloride. The authors found that the rate of reaction is proportional to the light absorbed and that hydrogen chloride has a significant inhibiting effect on the reaction. They propose a mechanism of reaction that explains the observed results and allows for the calculation of quantum efficiencies over a wide range.
