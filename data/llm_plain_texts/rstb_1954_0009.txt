tldr: The study investigates the sensitivity to light and reactions to changes in light intensity in the echinoid Diadema Antillarum. The responses of the spines, tube feet, and pedicellariae are examined, and it is found that the areas with the most melanin are the most sensitive. The radial nerve cords and their branches are affected by changes in light intensity, and the nervous system may be influenced directly by light. The findings are compared to similar phenomena in other animals and the photoreceptive surface in highly differentiated eyes.
