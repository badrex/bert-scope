tldr: The authors study the nodes of Ranvier, which are interruptions in the myelin sheath of nerve fibers. They find that these interruptions are essential for nerve conduction, as action currents pass from node to node. The authors also describe the various structures and layers surrounding a nerve fiber, such as the cementing disk and the neurilemma, which are unique to nodes of Ranvier. Their findings contribute to the understanding of how nerves transmit signals in the body.
