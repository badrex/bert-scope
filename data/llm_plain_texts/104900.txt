tldr: 'The author, William Watson, investigates the species of plant used to prepare the agaric, which is employed as a styptic. He consults with experts in Paris and concludes that the agaric is prepared from a plant called Agaricus pedis equini figura. The preparation process involves removing the hard parts, softening the substance, and dividing it into pieces. The author also discusses the opinions of other experts on the best type of agaric to use.'
