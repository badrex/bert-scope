tldr: The author investigates the heat of crystallization of quartz by examining previous experiments and their methods. They find that the low values obtained by other researchers are likely due to the prolonged grinding of the crystalline material, which causes a transformation to the vitreous condition. The author presents new experiments and results, providing a more accurate heat of crystallization value for quartz.
