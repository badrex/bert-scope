tldr: This paper by William Fairbairn investigates the strength of wrought iron plates and riveted joints in ship-building through a series of experiments. The author compares the strength of different types of iron plates and joints, as well as their value in relation to timber. The results show that iron is five times stronger than oak, making iron ships stronger and more secure than wooden ones. The paper also examines the transverse strength of various iron sections used in ship construction and recommends the use of angle-iron combinations for better strength.
