tldr: This article investigates the passive state of copper surfaces and its effect on adhesion. The authors discovered that a copper surface in the passive state exhibits a remarkable increase in the intensity of the attraction field due to a thin, tenuous surface film. This finding has implications for understanding the adhesion between dissimilar surfaces and the role of surface films in enhancing or reducing adhesion.
