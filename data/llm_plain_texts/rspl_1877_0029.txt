tldr: The author discusses the appearance of bright lines in the spectra of irresolvable nebulae and challenges Mr. Stone's hypothesis that these nebulae consist mainly of glowing gas. The author argues that the results of observation do not support Mr. Stone's theory and that the theory itself has grave objections. The author also explains the differences in the constitution of star clusters and their atmospheres.
