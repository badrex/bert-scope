tldr: The author studied the structure and movements of latero-frontal cilia in the gills of Mytilus, a type of mussel. They discovered that these cilia are made up of compound elements, including external triangular plates, basal granules, and possibly internal fibrils. These findings challenge previous theories of ciliary action and suggest that the separate elements within the cilia may have different mechanisms of movement.
