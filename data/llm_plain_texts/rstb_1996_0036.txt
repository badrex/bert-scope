tldr: The article discusses the role of neurotrophins and sensory neurons in development, maintenance, and injury. It examines the expression of the trk family of neurotrophin receptors in developing and adult dorsal root ganglion neurons. The study reveals that different subpopulations of sensory neurons express distinct trk receptors, which are crucial for their development and function. The findings provide insights into the role of various neurotrophins in the development and function of sensory neurons and their potential applications in treating injuries and diseases affecting the nervous system.
