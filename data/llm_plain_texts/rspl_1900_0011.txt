revised_title: Temperature Effects on Gas Viscosity
semantic_tags:
  - Gas viscosity
  - Temperature dependence
  - Kinetic theory
  - Sutherland's law
  - Gas properties
tldr: This article investigates the influence of temperature on the viscosity of gases, particularly argon and other gases. The author examines the theoretical argument proposed by Sutherland, which suggests that viscosity is proportional to a function of temperature with a constant specific to the gas. The author's observations support Sutherland's theory and provide values for the constants involved.
