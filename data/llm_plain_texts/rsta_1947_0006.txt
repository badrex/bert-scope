tldr: This article explores the effects of sweep-back angle on the drag and lift of supersonic aerofoils. The authors develop operational methods to analyze the wave drag and lift on swept-back wings, finding that sweep-back reduces wave drag but can lead to local singularities at the leading edge. The study provides valuable insights for the design of supersonic aircraft.
