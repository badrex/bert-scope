tldr: The author examines the skeletal structure and affinities of Parieasaurus bombidens, a fossil reptile from the Karoo deposits of South Africa. They discuss its similarities to other reptiles, amphibians, and mammals, and propose that Parieasaurus represents a transitional form between amphibians and reptiles. The author also explores the relationships between different reptile groups, such as Anomodontia, Nothosauria, Plesiosauria, and Crocodilia, and suggests that they all share a common Labyrinthodont ancestry.
