tldr: In this article, William Huggins and his wife report their discovery of hydrogen lines in the photographic spectrum of the Orion Nebula. They found that the hydrogen lines were stronger and broader on the plate as the Trapezium and its stars were approached. This discovery provided new insights into the conditions within the nebula and the behavior of its spectrum.
