tldr: The authors discuss the quantum theory of dispersion in metal conductors, focusing on the near infra-red region. They show that the equations for the index of refraction and the coefficient of reflection and extinction developed on a quantum-mechanical basis are formally identical to those obtained by Drude in 1900 using classical methods.
