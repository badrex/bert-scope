tldr: This article presents a method for determining the free periods of oscillation in an enclosed water body on a rotating Earth. The authors develop a general method that considers the shape, bathymetry, and Earth's rotation to determine the periods and structures of normal modes in any enclosed basin. They apply this method to Lakes Ontario and Superior, finding good agreement with previous time data analysis.
