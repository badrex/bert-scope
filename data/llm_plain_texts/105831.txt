tldr: In 1768, John Hope, a professor of physic and botany, discovered a rare plant in a lake on the Isle of Skye. The plant, initially thought to be a Calamaria, was later identified as possibly being Eriocaulon decangulare, a species never before described or properly figured. The plant was found to be widespread in the lake, with its roots interwoven so tightly that it could be torn up by the agitation of the waters.
