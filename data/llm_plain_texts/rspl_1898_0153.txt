tldr: This report discusses the findings of malaria research conducted in Calcutta by Major Ronald Ross and Dr. M. Foster. They observed the pigmented bodies in the stomach walls of mosquitoes fed on birds infected with Proteosoma and the changes these bodies undergo. They also demonstrated "germinal threads" in cysts, fluids, and cells related to mosquito-borne disease transmission.
