tldr: The article investigates the process of nucleation in silver azide using electron microscopy and diffraction techniques. The decomposition of single crystals into nitrogen and metallic silver is observed, allowing the study of nucleation and the formation of metallic nuclei. The research reveals that two forms of silver result from the decomposition: randomly oriented and highly oriented. The size of the nuclei does not change during the decomposition, but their density increases.
