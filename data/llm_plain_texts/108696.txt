tldr: The author, William John Macquorn Rankine, presents a thermo-dynamic theory for steam engines using dry saturated steam and its application to practice. He explains the process of liquefaction during steam expansion and the use of steam jackets to prevent it. Rankine also derives exact formulae for the action of steam in jacketed cylinders and provides examples of their application to steam vessels.
