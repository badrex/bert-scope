tldr: The author examines the development of the great anterior veins in humans and mammals, focusing on the metamorphosis of these vessels and their relation to the heart. They discovered that the coronary sinus, a part of the heart's veins, is analogous to the left vena cava in other mammals, and that remnants of the left primitive venous trunk can still be found in adult human hearts. This research provides a better understanding of the cardiovascular system and its development in humans and other mammals.
