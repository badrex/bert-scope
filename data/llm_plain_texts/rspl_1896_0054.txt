tldr: The author conducted experiments on the growth of the chick blastoderm to test Duval's theory of the formation of the primitive streak. The results showed that the primitive streak develops from the portion of the unincubated blastoderm between the center and the posterior margin of the area pellucida. The author also found that the anterior part of the embryo develops from the area anterior to the center of the blastoderm, while the rest of the embryo is formed by the activity of the primitive streak area.
