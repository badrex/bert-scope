tldr: This study investigates the removal of anthracene in polydimethyl siloxane fluids as a function of concentration, dose, and intensity. The results show a fundamental difference from previous findings in cyclohexane solutions, with little dependence on radiation intensity. An alternative theory is proposed, explaining reactions of active centers occurring with the neutral environment or anthracene molecules, consistent with the observed data.
