tldr: This article discusses the importance of predictive criteria in evaluating econometric models. The author presents a mixed analytical-Monte Carlo approach to analyze prediction tests, highlighting the properties of data processes and the structure of selected tests. The study finds that average annual forecast outcomes offer advantages over one-step or multi-step procedures, and that forecast-encompassing tests can have diagnostic power when applied to macroeconometric systems.
