tldr: The article discusses the resistance mechanisms in plants against vascular wilt fungi, focusing on primary and secondary determinants. It highlights the role of ethylene in pathogenesis and the formation of lignitubers as a defense mechanism against the pathogens. The study also emphasizes the importance of understanding these resistance mechanisms to develop effective strategies for controlling vascular wilt diseases.
