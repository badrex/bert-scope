tldr: The author presents a new approach to classical electrodynamics of a point particle using a non-singular current. This current, called a pointlike current, is used in the standard action integral to create a non-singular theory. The theory conserves energy-momentum and angular momentum and is applicable to particles with arbitrary finite electromagnetic moments.
