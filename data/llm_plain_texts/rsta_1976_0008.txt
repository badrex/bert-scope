tldr: The article discusses the Pan-African thermo-tectonic episode and its associated structures, which occurred between 650-450 million years ago. It examines whether these structures are ensialic or associated with subduction zones in a plate tectonic regime. The study also explores the pattern of the Pan-African domains, their stratigraphy, and their relation to earlier orogenic belts and lineaments.
