tldr: The article presents a hydrodynamical model for suction feeding in fish larvae, focusing on the role of frictional forces. The model calculates the influence of friction on suction by larvae and the power and energy used during suction. It also calculates the velocity field of water around the fish larva, allowing for the prediction of prey paths and critical factors in the escape reaction of prey from the suction flow. This model improves our understanding of the feeding mechanisms of fish larvae and can be used to study the interaction between prey and suction flow.
