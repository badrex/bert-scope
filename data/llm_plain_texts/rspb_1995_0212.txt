tldr: This study investigates the spatial and temporal genetic variation in British field populations of the grain aphid, Sitobion avenae, using molecular markers (RAPD-PCR). The results show that genetic variation among individuals caught in April on wheat and cocksfoot grass was independent of location. As the season progressed, host-based genetic structure became less evident due to genetic drift and local movement between adjacent host species. The findings suggest that long-distance migration has a less homogenizing effect on this species than previously thought.
