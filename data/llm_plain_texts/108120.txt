tldr: The author discusses the advancements made in zenith telescope observations and accuracy at the Royal Observatory. He explains the process he employed to determine the place of stars using three different methods, including the zenith telescope, mural circles, and a subsidiary star. The author found that the new zenith telescope achieved a degree of accuracy never seen before, reducing the error to a quarter of a second. This paper highlights the state of practical astronomy at the Greenwich Observatory and demonstrates the competition among observers using different instruments.
