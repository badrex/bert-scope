tldr: The author investigates the reaction between acids and glycol, discovering two new compounds: sulphoglycolate of baryta and chloracetine of glycol. The former is formed by reacting glycol with sulfuric acid, while the latter is created by mixing glycol with acetic acid and hydrochloric acid. The author also explores the properties and potential applications of these compounds, as well as their relationship to other isomers.
