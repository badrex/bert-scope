tldr: 'The author conducted experiments to study the distribution of velocities in beta rays from radioactive substances. They discovered that the absorption of beta rays does not follow an exponential law, but rather a linear one, indicating that the absorption coefficient increases with the thickness of matter traversed. This suggests that beta rays lose velocity as they pass through matter. The results confirm that beta rays are not homogeneous and that their velocities cover a wide range.'
