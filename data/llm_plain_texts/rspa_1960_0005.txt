tldr: This article explores the lattice statistics of a two-dimensional super-exchange antiferromagnet in a magnetic field. The authors analyze the interaction parameters, isotherms, and transition curves to understand the behavior of the antiferromagnet's energy, specific heat, and magnetization. The study provides insights into the relationship between temperature, magnetic field, and the properties of the decorated lattice.
