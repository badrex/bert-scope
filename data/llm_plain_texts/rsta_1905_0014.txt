tldr: This article explores the convergence of infinite series of analytic functions, focusing on the convergence of functions defined by linear differential equations of the second order. The author applies the results to the expansion of an arbitrary uniform analytic function in a series of hypergeometric functions and demonstrates the validity of the expansion if the function is regular within a certain ellipse in the complex plane.
