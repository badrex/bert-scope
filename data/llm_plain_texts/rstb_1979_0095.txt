tldr: 'This article discusses the application of epidemiological techniques to the interrelation between health, disease, and geochemistry, focusing on the potential hazards of man-made chemicals in the environment. The author highlights the importance of understanding the distribution and concentration of chemical elements in the environment and the use of mapping techniques to identify potential health risks. The article also emphasizes the need for collaboration between geochemists and epidemiologists to better understand the effects of long-term exposure to low doses of chemicals on human health.'
