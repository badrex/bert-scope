tldr: The authors numerically studied the steady, incompressible, high Reynolds number flow past a row of flat plates using a Galerkin finite element method. They found a transition from narrow wake eddies to wide wake eddies as the blockage ratio decreased, and their results suggest that this flow behavior is generic for any symmetric bluff body in this geometry.
