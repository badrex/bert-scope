tldr: The author investigates the history of the Mace given to the Royal Society by King Charles II and the story of it being the same Mace used by the Long Parliament. Through research, the author finds that the Mace used during the reign of Charles I was replaced by a new one during the Commonwealth period, and there is no evidence that the Mace in the Royal Society's possession is the same one used by the Long Parliament. The author concludes that the belief of it being the famous "Bauble" is a long-standing misconception.
