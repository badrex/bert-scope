tldr: Researchers discovered a unique tiered retina structure in the compound eyes of the aquatic beetle Dytiscus. The retina has two layers of rhabdoms, separated by a wide clear region, with photoreceptor units having extremely wide fields of view. This structure suggests that light entering any facet can excite a receptor belonging to any ommatidium in the eye. The findings challenge the previously known two main types of compound eyes and expand our understanding of insect vision.
