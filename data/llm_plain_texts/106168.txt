tldr: The author, John Hunter, conducted a detailed study on the anatomy of the Torpedo fish, focusing on its electric organs. He discovered the structure and function of these organs, which are responsible for the fish's ability to produce electric shocks. Hunter described the location, shape, and size of the electric organs, as well as the columns within them and their connections to the nervous system. He suggested that these nerves might be involved in the formation, collection, or management of the electric fluid, which is controlled by the will of the animal.
