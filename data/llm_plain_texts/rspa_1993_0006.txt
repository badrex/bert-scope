tldr: The authors propose a new method for selectively exciting, identifying, and imaging distinct tightly bound Bloch waves in off-axis transmission electron diffraction. They demonstrate that under certain diffraction conditions, a resonance coupling occurs between the incident electron beam and one distinct bound Bloch wave within the crystal. This allows for the imaging of individual tightly bound Bloch waves and provides a better understanding of crystal structures.
