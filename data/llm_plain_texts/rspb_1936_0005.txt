tldr: This study investigates the reflex mechanism of respiratory arrhythmia, focusing on the relationship between respiration and heart rate. The authors conducted experiments on heart-lung preparations and whole animals to understand the underlying mechanisms and the role of the vagus tone in respiratory arrhythmia. They found that there are at least two distinct mechanisms involved: a reflex and a central mechanism, which can overlap or interfere with each other. This research provides insights into the complex relationship between respiration and heart rate and the factors that influence it.
