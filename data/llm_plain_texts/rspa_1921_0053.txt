tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the catalytic reduction of ethylene to ethane using finely divided reduced nickel as the catalyst. They observed that the reaction rate increased rapidly to a maximum value and then gradually decreased. The reaction was found to be influenced by temperature and the composition of the gas mixture. The authors also discussed the preparation and use of the catalyst, as well as the experimental setup and procedure.
