tldr: This article explores the method of impact parameter in particle collisions, focusing on its applications in atomic physics and quantum mechanics. The author discusses various types of collisions, the spatial distribution of atoms affected by the collisions, and the connection between the perturbation of distant atoms and the loss of energy by electric particles. The article also considers the effects of relativity in light collisions and the impact of the method of impact parameter on the understanding of these phenomena.
