tldr: This article reviews simple instabilities in linear theories of coupled atmosphere-ocean models and describes the mechanisms for instability in these linear theories. It then discusses nonlinear coupled atmosphere-ocean simulations of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon and relates the instabilities seen in linear theory to the fully nonlinear ENSO simulations. The article also explores the relation between instability and predictability in the ENSO problem and reviews some recent work on predictability in coupled models.
