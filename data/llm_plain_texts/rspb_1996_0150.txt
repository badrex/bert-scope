tldr: This study investigates offspring sex and paternity in the collared flycatcher, testing the prediction that females would bias the sex ratio of extra-pair offspring in favor of sons. The researchers found no evidence to support this prediction, suggesting that females may not have sufficient physiological control over offspring sex or that the mechanisms for manipulating sex ratio are not finely tuned. The findings challenge previous studies on female control over offspring sex and paternity in birds.
