tldr: The author's experiments demonstrate the viability of ovarian tissue after freezing and the importance of slow cooling and the use of glycerol in preserving its function. The study shows that freezing and thawing can cause damage to the tissue, but with proper techniques, ovarian tissue can be preserved and used for grafting. The research also explores the effects of freezing on the homograft reaction and the potential protection low temperatures offer against the effects of X-irradiation.
