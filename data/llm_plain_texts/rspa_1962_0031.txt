tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the radical and molecular yields for tritium beta-particles in various aqueous solutions. They found that the primary process in tritium beta-irradiation is closer to that of cobalt-60 gamma-rays than alpha-particles. The results provide insights into the radiation chemistry of aqueous solutions and help understand the behavior of radicals and molecules under different conditions.
