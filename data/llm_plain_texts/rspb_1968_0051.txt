tldr: This symposium discusses the diverse biochemical processes that occur on Earth, focusing on anomalous aspects that may be significant in understanding the origins and distribution of life. The author suggests that different environments may favor different aspects of primitive biochemistry, and that a broader view of biochemistry should be taken when searching for life elsewhere in the universe.
