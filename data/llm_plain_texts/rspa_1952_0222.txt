tldr: This study investigates the thermionic constants of metals in the first transition group, including titanium to nickel, using a new experimental method. The method measures the saturation vapor pressure of the electron gas in equilibrium with the metal at different temperatures, providing more accurate results than the traditional diode method. The research focuses on the unique properties of transition metals, such as high electron density and specific heat, which make them particularly interesting for further study.
