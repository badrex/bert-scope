tldr: The authors conducted a comprehensive study on the constitution and mechanical properties of aluminium and zinc alloys. They analyzed the composition of the alloys, prepared them using pure metals, and studied their cooling curves. The results showed complex reactions and heat evolutions in the alloys, which led to the understanding of their constitution and properties. This research was essential for improving the knowledge of material science and the development of new alloys.
