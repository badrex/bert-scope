tldr: The authors conducted an experiment using an expansion chamber to analyze the energy distribution of radium beta rays. They found that the majority of particles had an energy of around 2200 Hp, with very few particles having energies greater than 5000 Hp. Their results contradict previous findings by Terroux, who estimated a higher percentage of particles with high energies. The authors discuss possible reasons for the discrepancy and suggest that further investigation is needed.
