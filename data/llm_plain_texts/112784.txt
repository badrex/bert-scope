revised_title: 'Nuclear Action in Supersaturated Saline Solutions'
semantic_tags:
  - Supersaturated solutions
  - Nuclei
  - Surface tension
  - Crystallization
  - Separation of salts
tldr: The author investigates the behavior of supersaturated saline solutions and the role of nuclei in separating salt from these solutions. They discover that the formation of films on the surface of the solution is crucial for the separation process, while the lenticular form of oil drops does not allow for sufficient contact with the solution to cause separation.
