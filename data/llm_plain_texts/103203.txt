tldr: The author, Francis Nevill, shares his observations about Lough-Neagh, a large lake in Ireland, and its surrounding environment. He debunks the myth of the lake's petrifying water and discusses the lake's fish species, including the "freshwater herrings" or pollans. He also mentions the lake's healing properties, particularly in treating skin ailments and the rheumatism, based on a notable case of a young man who was cured of his sores after bathing in the lake.
