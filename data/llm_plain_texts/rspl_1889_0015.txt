tldr: The author conducted a study on the early development of Lepidosteus osseus, a type of fish, during the first three weeks of its life. They collected material from Black Lake, New York, and observed the development process, including the formation of the egg, segmentation, and the development of the nervous system. The study provides insights into the early stages of fish development and the unique characteristics of the Lepidosteus osseus.
