revised_title: Fresnel's Convection Coefficient in Relativity
semantic_tags:
  - Relativity
  - Electromagnetic waves
  - Fresnel's convection coefficient
  - Maxwell's equations
  - Lorentz transformation
tldr: The authors explore the velocity of electromagnetic waves in a moving medium using Einstein's theory of relativity and Maxwell's equations. They find that Fresnel's convection coefficient can be explained through the Addition Theorem for two velocities, and they determine the velocity of light in a moving medium.
