tldr: 'Theodore von Kármán was a renowned engineering scientist, born in Budapest in 1881. He made significant contributions to aeronautical engineering, fluid mechanics, and solid mechanics. His work on the alternating double row of vortices behind a bluff body in a stream led to the discovery of the Karman vortex street, which has numerous applications in physics and engineering. Von Kármán was also a proponent of international collaboration in science and a successful organizer in its field.'
