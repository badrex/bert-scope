tldr: This study compares the geodetic reference levels of England and France using oceanographic methods to estimate the sea surface's slope. The authors found that the mean level of the sea is not a geopotential surface, making it impossible to equate the datum levels of the British and French leveling networks. They also considered the effects of tidal currents, waves, and atmospheric pressure on the sea level differences.
