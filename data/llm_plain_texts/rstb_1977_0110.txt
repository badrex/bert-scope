tldr: This article reviews the Late Devensian vegetation and environmental conditions in Ireland, focusing on new investigations at several sites. The author describes a sequence of vegetation development phases for the Dublin region and discusses regional variations elsewhere in Ireland. The article presents evidence for widespread soil erosion at the end of the Juniperus-Empetrum phase and documents a corrie glaciation at Lough Nahanagan in the Wicklow Mountains during the Artemisia phase. A radiocarbon chronology for events in the Late Devensian of Ireland is proposed.
