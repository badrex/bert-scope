tldr: This study examines the relationship between chylomicra (fat particles) and the endothelium of blood vessels in lactating mammary glands and lungs. The researchers found that chylomicra were more concentrated in the mammary gland vessels, adhering closely to the endothelium. They also observed that an enzyme, believed to be clearing factor lipase, was present in these vessels and played a role in the transport of fat through the vessel wall.
