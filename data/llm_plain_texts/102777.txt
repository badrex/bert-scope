tldr: The author, Anthony van Leuwenhoek, observed insects and their interactions with fruit trees. He discovered that black flies, which were abundant on fruit trees, did not harm the trees or their blossoms. Instead, they fed on the moisture from the leaves, and their eggs hatched into small creatures called lice. These lice, in turn, could become flies. The author also found that these insects reproduced without copulation, similar to creatures found in the male seed.
