tldr: This study examines the floodplain stratigraphy of two low-energy rivers in the East Midlands, UK, and presents a model of floodplain evolution applicable to other lowland rivers in temperate mid-latitudes. The research focuses on the Soar and Nene valleys, analyzing sedimentary architecture, radiocarbon dating, and the influence of soil development and sub-aerial processes on floodplain evolution. The findings suggest that new process-based interpretations of floodplain stratigraphy and models of floodplain evolution may be needed to understand the changing Lateglacial and Flandrian climate of lowland UK.
