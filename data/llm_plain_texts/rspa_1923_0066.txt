tldr: This article explores the relationship between Lindelöf's hypothesis and Riemann's zeta-function. The authors prove that these two hypotheses are equivalent and discuss various consequences of the Lindelöf hypothesis. They also establish the equivalence of several propositions related to the zeta-function and its applications to the divisor problems of Dirichlet and Piltz.
