tldr: The author examines the development of Paludina vivipara, focusing on its urinogenital organs and the theories of gasteropod torsion. They discuss the different schools of thought on the cause of torsion in Gasteropoda and present evidence supporting Pelseneer's hypothesis of a 180-degree twist during development. The author also investigates the role of organ displacement in the ontogeny of Paludina, providing insights into the evolution of this species.
