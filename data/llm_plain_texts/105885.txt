tldr: Captain Thomas Davies shares a method for preserving and mounting birds for natural history collections. The process involves carefully removing the flesh, using a special composition of burnt alum, camphire, and cinnamon to preserve the skin, and refilling the body cavity with cotton or wool. The eyes are replaced with black sealing wax drops, and the head is filled with cotton and the same composition. Finally, the skin is sewn up and feathers are reattached. This method helps to preserve the specimens for future study and display.
