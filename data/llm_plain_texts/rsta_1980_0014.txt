tldr: This article discusses the evolution of passive continental margins in the Norwegian-Greenland Sea, focusing on the margins' classification, structural features, and the impact of plate tectonics on their development. The authors review recent research, including data from deep sea drilling and multichannel seismic profiles, and provide insights into the rifting of the continental crust and the formation of deep oceans and passive continental margins.
