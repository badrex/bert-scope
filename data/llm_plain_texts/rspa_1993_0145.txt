tldr: The authors developed a micromechanics theory to predict the effective electroelastic behavior of piezoelectric composite materials containing ellipsoidal inhomogeneities. They obtained four tensors analogous to Eshelby's tensor in elasticity to describe the constraints of the matrix on the inclusions. The theory considers the effects of concentration, shape, and material properties of the reinforcement on the effective properties of piezoelectric composites, providing a better understanding of their behavior in electromechanical transducers and smart materials.
