tldr: The authors explore an alternative interpretation of the stress-energy tensor in the context of the continuous creation of matter, as proposed by Bondi and Gold. They discuss the effects of assigning an absolute value to stress and the contribution of stress to gravitational mass, and propose a modification to the physical interpretation of the tensor. This new interpretation helps to relate the work to other parts of physical theory.
