tldr: The study investigates gap junctions between dendrites and somata of neurons in the primate sensori-motor cortex. These junctions, which allow direct electrical transmission of activity, were found infrequently between dendrites or a dendrite and a cell soma. The findings suggest that some neurons in the sensori-motor cortex are electrotonically coupled, providing insight into the communication and connectivity of neurons in the brain.
