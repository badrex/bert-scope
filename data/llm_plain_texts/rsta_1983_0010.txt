tldr: The article presents observations and modeling of radiative properties in a cloud-capped atmospheric boundary layer during the Joint Air-Sea Interaction Project (JASIN). The study focuses on a uniform stratocumulus cloud, providing detailed measurements of thermodynamic, cloud physics, and radiation fields. The results show a well-mixed boundary layer with cloud liquid water contents close to adiabatic values. The longwave and shortwave radiative components of the cloud layer energy budget were measured and compared with several radiation schemes, demonstrating good agreement. The study concludes that radiative cloud-cloud interactions do not play a dominant role in the bulk radiative properties of cloud fields, which are mainly determined by cloud amount and the vertical and horizontal optical depths of the clouds within the field.
