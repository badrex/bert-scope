tldr: The author improves upon Lighthill's method for solving an integral equation related to heat transfer in compressible laminar boundary layers. By refining the series expansion and asymptotic expansion, the author achieves a more accurate solution for the integral equation. The convergence analysis shows that the method yields results within a maximum error of 2 units in the seventh decimal place.
