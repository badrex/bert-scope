tldr: The author investigates the complex movement activity patterns of individual ants and ant colonies, finding evidence of chaotic dynamics in their behavior. By analyzing the attractor of movement activity and measuring its dimension, the study suggests that individual ant activity may be constrained to a low-dimensional surface, while colony activity shows nearly periodic motion consistent with a toroidal attractor. This research simplifies the task of describing the dynamics of animal behavior and improves our understanding of its operation and evolution.
