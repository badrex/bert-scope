tldr: This study examines the anatomy of the nervous system in the genus Gerris (Hemiptera-Heteroptera) and provides a comprehensive account of its structure and function. The research focuses on Gerris lacustris L., a common species found on the surface of still and flowing waters. The condensed condition of the central nervous system, specializations of the peripheral nervous system, and polymorphism of the flight apparatus are the main interests in this study. The research uses various histological methods to analyze the nervous system and its connections with muscles and sensory fields. The findings contribute to the understanding of insect neurology and the complex organization of the nervous system in this group of insects.
