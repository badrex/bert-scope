tldr: The author presents new phase-integral quantization conditions for the energy levels of a rigid diatomic dipole molecule in a homogeneous electric field. These conditions, expressed in terms of complete elliptic integrals, are expected to be most accurate when the magnetic quantum number is large or equal to zero. The investigation demonstrates the great accuracy of the energy levels yielded by the quantization conditions for arbitrary electric field strengths.
