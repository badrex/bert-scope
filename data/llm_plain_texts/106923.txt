tldr: The author, John Haighton, conducted a series of experiments to study animal impregnation and the formation of corpora lutea. He examined the ovaries of virgin rabbits and observed the changes that occurred during impregnation. Haighton discovered that the formation of corpora lutea is a reliable indicator of impregnation, as they form after the male's fecundating fluid affects the female's ovaries. This research helped to clarify the process of impregnation and the role of corpora lutea in animal reproduction.
