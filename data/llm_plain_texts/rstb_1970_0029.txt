tldr: The article discusses the middle Pleistocene deposits at Marks Tey, Essex, and provides a detailed analysis of the palaeobotanical evidence found in the lacustrine sediments. The study reveals that the deposits were formed during the Lowestoft glaciation and were gradually filled during the Hoxnian interglacial and the early part of the Gipping glacial period. Pollen analysis of the deposits provides a complete vegetational record throughout the Hoxnian interglacial, allowing for the reconstruction of the interglacial's vegetational and climatic development. The study also suggests that the timespan of the interglacial period was approximately 30,000 to 50,000 years.
