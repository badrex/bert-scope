tldr: The author, John Dalton, continues his research on the constitution of the atmosphere, focusing on the proportions of oxygen and azote in gaseous mixtures. He discusses various methods of analyzing these mixtures and presents a table of results from experiments conducted by Mr. Cavendish. Dalton also explores the limitations and restrictions of electric sparks in causing explosions and complete combinations in gaseous mixtures, and suggests improvements for eudiometer experiments.
