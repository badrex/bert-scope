revised_title: 'Nucleon Green Function in Pseudoscalar Meson Theory: A New Approach'
semantic_tags:
  - Quantum Field Theory
  - Particle Physics
  - Meson Theory
  - Functional Integration
  - Green Functions
tldr: The authors extend the method of functional integration to evaluate the one-nucleon Green function in pseudoscalar meson theory, including nucleon recoil. They discuss the formal extension of the method and the inclusion of vacuum polarization effects. The resulting forms and the evaluation of the functional integral are also discussed.
