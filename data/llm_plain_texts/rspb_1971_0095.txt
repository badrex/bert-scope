tldr: The authors discuss the potential of chloroplast fragments in a wholly artificial environment for optimal photosynthesis conditions. They explore the use of isolated chloroplasts in various catalytic systems to harness light energy for different reductions. The study also investigates the distribution of photosynthetic products within the intact leaf and the movement of molecules between the chloroplast and the rest of the leaf.
