tldr: The authors studied the structure of GaAs (001) surfaces during OMCVD growth and found that dimer formation occurs under various non-uhv conditions. They discovered that the surface structure varies with the supply rates of TMG and arsine and the substrate temperature. This research has significant implications for understanding surface processes in semiconductor manufacturing.
