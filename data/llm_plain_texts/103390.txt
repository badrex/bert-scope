tldr: This article presents two extraordinary cases of surgery. In the first case, a man's leg was severely injured and eventually healed, with the flesh regenerating and attaching itself to the bone. In the second case, a woman's body was able to identify and expel foreign substances, such as food, through her wounds. Both cases demonstrate the remarkable resilience and healing abilities of the human body.
