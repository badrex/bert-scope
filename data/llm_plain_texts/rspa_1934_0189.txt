tldr: The authors conducted intensity measurements in a fine structure multiplet of As II using a 11 mm silvered Fabry-Perot interferometer. They used a water-cooled hollow cathode as a light source and developed a method of reduction that takes into consideration the intensity distributions in the source and the interferometer. The mean values of the intensity ratios obtained from 42 independent observations on six spectrograms agreed with the theoretical values, proving that the weights of the fine structure levels in the 5s3P1 term are proportional to 2P + 1.
