tldr: The study examines the effect of low oxygen tension on the activity of aerobic dehydrogenase enzymes, such as D-amino-acid oxidase, xanthine oxidase, and glucose oxidase. The research found that the rate of substrate oxidation decreases significantly at oxygen tensions below 20%, indicating that these enzymes have low oxygen affinity. Additionally, the study discovered that the substrate concentration required for half-maximal oxidation rates decreases with a lowering of oxygen tension.
