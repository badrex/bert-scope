tldr: This article discusses a forgotten publication by Frederick Gowland Hopkins, who advocated for the consumption of a bread with more germ and bran, known as "standard bread." Hopkins believed that this type of bread contained unrecognised food substances that allowed our systems to make full use of the tissue-building elements of the grain. He conducted experiments on young animals and found that they grew much faster on brown flour than white flour, suggesting that standard bread had a higher nutritional value.
