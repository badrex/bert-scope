tldr: The author applies Marcel Riesz's method to solve normal hyperbolic differential equations, specifically the wave equation, and demonstrates its applications in the electromagnetic field and meson field theories. The Riesz potential and Riesz field strength are introduced, and the author shows how they satisfy Maxwell's equations. The method allows for the avoidance of divergence and singularity difficulties, making it valuable for solving problems in mathematical physics.
