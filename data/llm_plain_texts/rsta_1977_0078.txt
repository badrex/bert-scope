revised_title: Reevaluating the Origin of Excess Argon in Lunar Soils

tldr: This article discusses experimental findings and considerations that cast doubt on the retrapping mechanism as the sole source of excess argon in lunar soils. The authors present evidence for a second process, the transient coating, which may contribute to the excess argon. Further studies are needed to settle the question of the origin of the excess argon in lunar soils.
