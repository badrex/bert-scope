tldr: The study investigates the role of adrenoceptors in the cryptic patterning of the flatfish, Pleuronectes americanus. The researchers found that a-adrenoceptors mediate melanosome aggregation in each pattern component, with differential responsiveness to noradrenaline. The study also demonstrates pattern-related presynaptic neuromodulation and provides insights into the neural and hormonal control of melanophores in teleosts.
