tldr: The orbitofrontal cortex, a part of the prefrontal cortex, plays a crucial role in decoding primary reinforcers like taste, learning and reversing associations of visual and other stimuli to these primary reinforcers, and controlling and correcting reward-related and punishment-related behavior. Damage to the orbitofrontal cortex impairs learning and reversal of stimulus-reinforcement associations, and can affect face expression identification and emotional responses.
