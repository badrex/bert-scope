tldr: The author examines the effects of overexertion on the air cells of the lungs in animals, particularly hares, and compares them to the structure of human lungs. They discovered that overexertion causes the superficial air cells to fill with coagulable lymph, while the smaller interior cells fill with blood. This research provides insight into the development of tubercles, which are prevalent and destructive diseases in humans. The author also discusses the importance of comparative anatomy in understanding human anatomy and physiology.
