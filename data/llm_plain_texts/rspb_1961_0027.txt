tldr: The authors studied the structure of the muscle fibers in the translucent part of the oyster's adductor muscle. They discovered that the fibers have two types of filaments, thick paramyosin filaments and thinner actin filaments, which are short and parallel to the fiber axis. The arrangement of these filaments forms A-bands and I-bands, similar to striated muscles. The muscle contracts by a sliding filament mechanism, where the filaments slide past each other when the muscle changes length. This discovery helps to understand the unique properties of tonic muscles in mollusks, which can maintain tension without fatigue.
