tldr: The authors examine Dirac's Large Numbers Hypothesis and its compatibility with the Einstein theory of gravitation. They explore a cosmological model described by an "atomic" metric and discuss the differences between Dirac's Einstein-de Sitter model and standard relativistic cosmology. The study highlights the implications of the hypothesis and its potential testable predictions.
