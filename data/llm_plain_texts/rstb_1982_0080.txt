tldr: This article discusses the importance of studying disorders of attention as a frontier in neuropsychology. It highlights the complexity of attentional systems and their dependence on previous learning, making it unlikely that their neural representation could be entirely within brain-stem structures of limited extent. The author emphasizes the need to recognize and understand global disorders of attention, which are common and have a rich clinical symptomatology, as they represent disturbances of one of the highest levels of complex functioning of the nervous system.
