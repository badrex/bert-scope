tldr: The authors studied the far infrared spectra of charge-transfer complexes between iodine and substituted pyridines in cyclohexane solutions. They discovered two absorption bands associated with the complex, one near 180 cm⁻¹ and another in the range of 65 to 95 cm⁻¹. The study found that the degree of electron transfer and bond force constants remained relatively constant along the series, while the vibration frequencies were affected by mass, electronic effects, and steric influences of the substituents. The authors also determined equilibrium constants for the formation of the complexes, providing insights into the association behavior of these charge-transfer complexes.
