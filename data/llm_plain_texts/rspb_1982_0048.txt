tldr: The authors discovered that the asymmetry current in squid axons can be divided into two components: an inactivating component and a non-inactivating component. They found that the inactivating component has a slower rising phase and is related to the sodium conductance, while the non-inactivating component rises faster and is not directly related to the sodium system. This research helps to better understand the functioning of the nerve membrane and the properties of ion channels.
