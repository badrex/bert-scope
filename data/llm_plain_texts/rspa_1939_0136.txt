tldr: This article presents analytical solutions for stress systems in aeolotropic plates, focusing on the distribution of stress and displacement in materials with two directions of symmetry. The study provides equations for stress functions and discusses the application of these solutions to problems involving internal forces, stress distributions, and material properties of aeolotropic materials like oak and spruce.
