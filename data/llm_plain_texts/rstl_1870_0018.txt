tldr: The author, Henry E. Roscoe, conducted research on vanadium and its compounds. He discovered that metallic vanadium absorbs hydrogen and undergoes oxidation when exposed to air. Roscoe also studied the properties and reactions of vanadium oxytribromide, oxydibromide, and tribromide, and discussed methods for preparing and analyzing these compounds.
