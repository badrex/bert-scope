tldr: The author, J. Norman Lockyer, studied the photographic spectra of 171 stars and classified them based on the amount of continuous absorption at the blue end and the presence of hydrogen lines. The study also explored the meteoritic hypothesis, which suggests that celestial bodies are or have been swarms of meteorites. The author discusses the implications of this hypothesis on the classification of stars and the spectra of nebulae.
