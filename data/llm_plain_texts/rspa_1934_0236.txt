tldr: This study investigates the slow oxidation of methane and ethane at high pressures, focusing on the formation of alcohols and aldehydes. The authors found that increasing the rate of flow and using a flow method allowed for a higher proportion of primary products, such as alcohols, to survive. The results support the hydroxylation theory of hydrocarbon combustion.
