tldr: The author, John Wood, presents the results of his observations on human muscular variations in over six hundred subjects. He classifies these variations into different categories, such as redundancy, development, and suppression, and discusses their frequency, distribution, and association with other irregularities. The study also highlights some unique muscular features and variations in humans compared to other animals.
