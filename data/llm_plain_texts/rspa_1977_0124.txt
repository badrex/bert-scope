tldr: The authors propose a method to calculate 'basic' radii for simple and complex spherical ions using the Huggins and Mayer method for the calculation of repulsion energy in ionic crystals. They establish 'basic' radii for alkali metal and halide ions using more recent data than those used originally by Huggins and discuss the application of the method for salts containing spherical complex ions. The authors also examine the accuracy and reliability of repulsion energy calculations for potassium hexachloroplatinate in the current literature.
