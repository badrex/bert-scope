tldr: The authors critique Ruelle's upper bound on correlation dimension estimates, arguing that it is not valid for general correlation dimension estimates and is too weak to be useful. They show that the bound does not necessarily limit all estimates of correlation dimensions and emphasize the importance of discussing error in correlation dimension calculations.
