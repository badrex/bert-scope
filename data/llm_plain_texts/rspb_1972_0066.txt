tldr: The study investigates the hydrodynamics of fish turning manoeuvres, focusing on freshwater fish that require rapid manoeuvring in confined spaces. The authors analyze the turning process into three distinct stages based on the movements of the centre of mass and calculate the forces and moments acting on the fish. The results show good agreement with experimental observations, providing insights into the mechanisms used by fish for changing direction and potential applications for improving the manoeuvrability of man-made vessels.
