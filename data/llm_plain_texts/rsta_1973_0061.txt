tldr: This article discusses the two main methods of numerical analysis used for solving problems in small and large displacement elasticity and elasto-plastic problems: the finite element method and the dynamic relaxation method. The author provides a detailed explanation of the finite element procedure, its advantages, and its applications in various fields, including frame structures, plate, shell, and solid elements. The article also highlights the challenges and solutions in calculating stress and strain using these methods.
