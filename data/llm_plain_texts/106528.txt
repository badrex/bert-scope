tldr: The author, Charles Blagden, observed the heat of the Gulf Stream's water and found it to be six degrees hotter than the surrounding sea water in April. He also estimated the stream's width to be about twenty leagues. This research could help in understanding the nature and movement of the Gulf Stream.
