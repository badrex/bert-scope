tldr: The authors present a two-friction itinerant-oscillator model for molecular motion in dipolar fluids, calculating polarizability and time-correlation functions through numerical methods. They compare their model with experimental measurements on hexanone-2 and acetonitrile, discussing the effects of inertial forces and dipole-dipole coupling on the Debye and far-infrared absorption of polar fluids. The model is shown to agree well with experimental observations, suggesting that the two-friction version should be used for further comparisons.
