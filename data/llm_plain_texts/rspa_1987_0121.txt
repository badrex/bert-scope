tldr: This article explores internal dissipative waves in poroelastic media, focusing on the propagation and damping of these waves. Two distinct wave types are identified, one characterized by a long dissipation length scale and the other with comparable dissipation and wavelengths. The study provides insights into the dynamic behavior of fluid-filled porous media and has implications for geophysics, acoustics, and oceanography.
