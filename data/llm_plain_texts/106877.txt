tldr: The author conducted a series of experiments on Tabasheer, a substance found in bamboo, to analyze its properties and chemical composition. The experiments included examining its density, transparency, and reaction with various chemicals. Tabasheer was found to be resistant to acids and did not produce any significant changes when exposed to heat. The author concluded that Tabasheer is a unique and complex substance, but more research is needed to fully understand its composition and potential uses.
