tldr: The author describes a method to separate volatile gases from air without liquefaction using charcoal absorption. The process involves cooling air to create a high vacuum and using charcoal to capture and concentrate gases like helium, neon, and hydrogen. This method has potential applications in studying atmospheric gases and minerals containing similar elements.
