tldr: This article presents field measurements of the dry deposition of sulfur dioxide to various surfaces, including grass, soil, and water. The authors find that the deposition velocities for these surfaces are close to 1, with an upper limit of 2 for coniferous forests. The results support a mean deposition velocity of 0.85 cm for Britain and suggest that dry deposition and precipitation together limit the mean residence time of sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere to about two days. The study highlights the importance of dry deposition in the transport and removal of sulfur dioxide from the atmosphere.
