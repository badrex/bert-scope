tldr: This study examines the concentrations of proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids in 1 cm sections of sediments from offshore Peru to understand the changes occurring in organic matter during early diagenesis. The research provides a mass balance for organic carbon and discusses the relationship between different biochemical fractions and their variations with increasing depth. The findings contribute to the understanding of sedimentary geochemical processes in upwelling zones.
