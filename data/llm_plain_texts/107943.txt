tldr: The author presents further experiments with a new register-pyrometer to measure the expansion of solids, focusing on the accuracy and precision of the instrument. They compare their results with previous experiments by Dulong and Petit, and discuss the expansion of various metals, including platinum, iron, and copper. The author also provides a detailed method for determining the expansion of metals to their melting points and discusses the implications of their findings for the accuracy of temperature measurements.
