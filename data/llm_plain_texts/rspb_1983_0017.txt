tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of changing gas phase on the steady-state chlorophyll a fluorescence in illuminated leaves. They found that removing CO2 caused a rise and then a fall to a new steady-state level. The results showed that changes in CO2 and O2 concentrations affected the fluorescence, which is related to photosynthetic carbon assimilation and its regulatory mechanisms.
