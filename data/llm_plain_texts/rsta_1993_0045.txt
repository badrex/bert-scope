tldr: The author explores hypothetical graphite structures with negative gaussian curvature, derived from a graphite net by including rings of seven or eight bonds. These structures are based on coverings of periodic minimal surfaces and have potential lower energies than convex fullerenes. The research also discusses cylindrical and conical structures, regular and semi-regular polyhedra, and the extension of polyhedra to include infinitely periodic structures.
