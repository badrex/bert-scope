tldr: The authors studied the motor cell groups and spinal accessory nerve in the spinal cord of a porpoise (Phocoena communis) to understand the differences in musculature compared to humans. They found clear differentiation in the shape of grey matter and cell groups in various segments of the cord, which correlated with the parts supplied with motor nerves. The study also revealed some unrecorded features in the porpoise spinal cord's minute structure.
