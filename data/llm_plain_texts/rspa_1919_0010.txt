tldr: The author analyzes the lunar observations made since 1620 and compares the observed values with the results of the theoretical investigation of the terms of long period on the Moon's motion. The study finds that there is no discordance between the theoretical and observed values of the secular acceleration in the motion of the Moon in mean longitude, and thus, no evidence of tidal retardation in the Earth's rotation.
