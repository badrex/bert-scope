tldr: The authors studied the colloidal behavior of four acid dyes using light-scattering techniques. They found that Orange II does not form stable micelles, while Benzo-purpurin forms stable micelles with a process similar to diffusion-controlled condensation polymerization. Coomassie Milling Scarlet and Polar Yellow exhibit different behaviors in terms of salt sensitivity and micelle formation. The authors discuss the factors involved in the formation and properties of colloidal micelles of dyes.
