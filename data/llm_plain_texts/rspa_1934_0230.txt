tldr: The author explores the principle of least action in Milne's kinematical relativity, demonstrating how free particles in a simple kinematical system follow this principle. The study involves finding a weighting factor that allows the equations of motion to be expressed in the form of the principle of least action, showing that Milne's system is fundamentally different from Einstein's general relativity.
