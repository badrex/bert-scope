tldr: This article discusses the synthesis and characterization of iron-molybdenum-sulfur clusters, which are present in nitrogenase enzymes. The authors describe the preparation and structure of these complexes, focusing on cubane-like clusters and their electronic properties. They also explore the redox properties of these complexes and their potential relevance to the nitrogenase enzymes.
