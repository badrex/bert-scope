tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the function of phosphates in alcoholic fermentation by yeast-juice. They found that phosphates are essential for fermentation, as they increase the total fermentation amount and produce a reducing substance, which is a sugar. The results provide strong evidence that phosphates play a crucial role in alcoholic fermentation.
