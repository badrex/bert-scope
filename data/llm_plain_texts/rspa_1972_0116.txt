tldr: The authors developed a new electron microscopy imaging method using an electrostatic phase plate, which enhances detail in biological materials and improves resolution. This method creates a more uniform phase shift between unscattered and scattered waves, resulting in a faithful representation of the object structure. The technique emphasizes details within the biological material and reduces contrast from surrounding stains, allowing for better preservation of specimen morphology.
