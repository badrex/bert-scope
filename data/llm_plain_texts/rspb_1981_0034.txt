tldr: The authors used the calcium indicator dye arsenazo III to monitor intracellular calcium concentration changes in the presynaptic terminal of the squid giant synapse. They found that the dye allowed them to record calcium transients during synaptic transmission, providing insights into the role of calcium ions in the process. This research contributes to the understanding of how nerve impulses trigger the release of neurotransmitters at synapses.
