tldr: The author examines the Tristichace and Podostemace plant families, which have unique and varied morphological structures, and live under extremely uniform conditions. They argue that since these plants have evolved under the same conditions, there is no adaptation to different environments, and that evolution must have occurred through mutations rather than small variations. The author also discusses the factors that may have influenced the evolution of these families, such as their mode of life, temperature conditions, and food supply.
