tldr: This article discusses a series of seismic refraction profiles conducted between Kenya and the Seychelles to study the crustal structure in the northwest Indian Ocean. The researchers observed thick sediments extending 300 to 400 km from the African coast and found that the mantle is unusually shallow near the Seychelles Bank. The results provide insights into the tectonic history and evolution of the region.
