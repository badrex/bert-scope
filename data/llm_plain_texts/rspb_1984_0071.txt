tldr: 'This study investigates color vision polymorphism in squirrel monkeys, discovering that some animals are dichromatic, while others are trichromatic. The behavioral tests and microspectrophotometric measurements of cone photopigments show that the variation in color vision arises from differences in retinal photopigments. This research helps to understand genetic variations in color vision within species, including humans.'
