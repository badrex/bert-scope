tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the composition and properties of emeralds and beryls, specifically focusing on the role of carbon in their coloration and the effects of fusion. They found that the presence of carbon in beryls and emeralds does not determine their color, and that the fusion process can alter the hardness and specific gravity of these stones. The author also explored the use of artificial mixtures of beryl ingredients and their potential applications in creating beautiful gem-like glasses.
