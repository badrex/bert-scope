revised_title: 'Fish Shoaling Preferences: Choosing Poor Competitors'
semantic_tags:
  - Fish behavior
  - Shoaling
  - Competitive ability
  - Animal social behavior
  - Ideal Free Distribution
tldr: 'This study shows that European minnows can recognize and prefer to shoal with fish that are poor competitors. This preference is independent of size, overt aggression, and familiarity with other fish. The ability to recognize and prefer poor competitors may explain the distribution of animals in foraging groups according to the Ideal Free Distribution, despite the violation of its key assumption of equal competitive abilities.'
