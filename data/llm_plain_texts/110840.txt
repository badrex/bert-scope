tldr: 'John P. Gassiot conducted a series of experiments with a large water battery to study the relationship between electrical and chemical actions in voltaic circuits. He discovered that the elements in the battery develop polar tension before the circuit is completed, and that static effects precede and are independent of the completion of the voltaic circuit. Gassiot also found that the chemical effects in the experiments were very weak but similar to those exhibited by more powerful voltaic combinations.'
