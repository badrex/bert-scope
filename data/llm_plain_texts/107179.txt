tldr: The author, William Hyde Wollaston, discovered a new metal called Palladium while studying the composition of Platina ore. He found that Palladium has unique properties, such as its resistance to nitro-muriatic acid and its ability to form a red solution when mixed with certain chemicals. Wollaston also discovered other substances in the Platina ore, including Rhodium and a black powder he named Iridium and Osmium.
