tldr: The author, Charles Hatchett, discovered that tannin, a substance found in plants, can be artificially produced from various materials, including minerals, vegetables, and animal substances. He found that tannin forms when carbon is combined with oxygen in these materials. This discovery expanded the understanding of tannin's properties and its potential uses.
