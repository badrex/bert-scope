tldr: The article examines the effect of an aligned magnetic field on the lifting force experienced by a flat plate at incidence in a conducting fluid. The author solves the governing integral equation numerically and analytically, finding that the solution is unique for all values of the conductivity parameter. The study also reveals the behavior of the solution when the conductivity is large, and discusses the implications for the Kutta-Joukowski condition in magneto-fluid dynamics.
