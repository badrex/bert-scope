tldr: The authors conducted experiments with the freshwater diatom Navicula pelliculosa and the green alga Chlorella vulgaris to study the effects of silicon and aluminium on their growth. They found that aluminium toxicity reduced the biologically available phosphorus fraction, and silicic acid protected against this effect by binding aluminium in competition with phosphorus. The study suggests that silicon may increase the biological availability of phosphorus in the presence of aluminium, playing a crucial role in algae biology.
