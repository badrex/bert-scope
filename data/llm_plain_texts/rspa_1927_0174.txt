tldr: The authors explore the relationship between the Green's functions and Birkhoff's work on adjoint differential equations. They prove that when the equations merge into the differential equation, the transposed equations also merge into the adjoint equation. They consider the case of the differential equation with boundary conditions and determine the matrices to satisfy the adjoint boundary conditions.
