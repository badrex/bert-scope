tldr: 'The authors analyzed lava samples collected during the 1971 eruption of Mount Etna and observed a certain evolution of the magma composition. They found that the first lavas were phonolitic tephrites, while the last ones were mugearites. This evolution can be explained by assuming pneumatolytic differentiation in the upper parts of the magma column and gravitational differentiation in its deeper parts. The study also compared the 1971 lava compositions with ancient products of Mount Etna, revealing a unique magmatic evolution during this eruption.'
