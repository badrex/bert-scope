tldr: The author conducted experiments to prove that fluids pass directly from the stomach to the blood circulation without going through the thoracic duct. They discovered that the spleen is not the channel for these fluids, and the fluids are instead deposited in the spleen, gall bladder, and urinary bladder in a similar manner. The experiments also provided insights into the functions of the spleen in the animal economy.
