tldr: The authors investigate the absorption of penetrating radiation and its relation to the surrounding medium. They analyze the significance of an experimental absorption curve to infer the spectral distribution of primary radiation. The study focuses on two processes that lead to a reduction in the intensity of a beam of radiation passing through matter: photoelectric absorption and the Compton scattering process. The authors also discuss the influence of the surrounding medium on the ionization produced in an electroscope by changing the number and velocity distribution of ionizing particles.
