tldr: 'Martin Barry's research in 1843 discovered spermatozoa inside the ovum, proving the penetration of sperm into the egg. This finding was overlooked by Dr. Nelson, who later claimed to have established the fact in his research on Ascaris Mystax. Barry's work on mammiferous ova provided evidence that the penetration of spermatozoa into the ovum was an established fact before Nelson's research.'
