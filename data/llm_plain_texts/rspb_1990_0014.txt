tldr: The authors studied the physiology of HI horizontal cells in the primate retina, specifically in Macaca mulatto. They discovered that these cells respond to light with graded hyperpolarizations and have a non-specific, broad-band sensitivity to mid-spectral wavelengths. The cells contact cones in an indiscriminate fashion, and their responses are not involved in processing color contrast. These findings contribute to understanding the role of horizontal cells in the primate retina and their connection to cones and rods.
