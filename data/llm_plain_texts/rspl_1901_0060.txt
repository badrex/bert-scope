tldr: This article presents a supplement to a previous memoir on skew variation, discussing the mathematical foundations of frequency distributions and their applications in the field of biology, particularly in the context of organic variation and botanical studies. The author introduces new solutions to a differential equation that better describe skew distributions and provides examples of their use in analyzing biological data.
