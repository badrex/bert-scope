tldr: The authors calculate the free energy of interaction between two identical spherical colloidal particles using potential distribution in the electric double layer. They compare two approximate methods, one based on the series solution of the linear Debye-Huckel equation and the other on the Derjaguin theory. The study helps in understanding the stability properties of colloidal systems.
