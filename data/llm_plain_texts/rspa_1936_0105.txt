tldr: The authors studied electron diffraction in graphite and discovered that both artificial and natural graphite powders produce diffractions that do not match the previously assigned structure by X-ray workers. They found that these "extra" diffractions are not due to impurities or dimensional lattice deviations. Thin single crystals of graphite also produce these extra diffractions, while thick crystals show Kikuchi line patterns consistent with X-ray results. The authors concluded that the extra diffractions are due to the limited dimensions of the graphite lattice in thin crystals, allowing for fractional index and forbidden diffractions.
