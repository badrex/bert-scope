tldr: This article presents a dynamic crack tip shielding model to describe the brittle-ductile transition of precracked crystals in constant strain-rate tests. Dislocations emitted from sources at or near the crack tip help shield the most vulnerable parts of the crack, preventing failure. The model accounts for the strain-rate dependence of the transition temperature and predicts a dependence of the transition on dislocation density.
