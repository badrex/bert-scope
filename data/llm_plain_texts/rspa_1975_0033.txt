tldr: The authors studied the absorption spectrum of chromium vapor at wavelengths below 200 nm and measured the absorption cross-sections and oscillator strengths of the autoionized lines. They also determined the ionization potential and reported new wavelengths and transition probabilities of unlisted transitions. This research provides valuable data for understanding the continuous absorption cross-sections of iron-group metals in astrophysics.
