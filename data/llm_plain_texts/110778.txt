tldr: The author, Martin Barry, examines blood coagulation and discovers two different types of blood discs. He observes the formation of structures similar to those in the body's tissues and discusses the role of parent-cells in the reproduction of blood corpuscles. Barry also explores the resemblance of blood corpuscle filaments to those of certain intestinal worms and questions whether blood corpuscles should be considered as ova.
