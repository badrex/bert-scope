tldr: The authors developed a technique to use moiré patterns from overlapping metal crystals to study dislocations in metals indirectly. They found that edge and screw dislocations in one crystal create terminating half-lines in the moiré pattern, allowing for the observation and analysis of dislocations in metal lattices. This technique has potential applications in understanding lattice imperfections and their effects on mechanical properties.
