tldr: The author's study of mouse taenia coli smooth muscle contraction reveals the presence of thick and thin filaments. In contracted fibers, thick and thin filaments are intermingled randomly, while in relaxed fibers, actin filaments are clearly ordered into bundles. The author proposes a contraction model where the contractile apparatus of smooth muscles is composed of small contraction units of inter-digitating bundles of thick and thin filaments.
