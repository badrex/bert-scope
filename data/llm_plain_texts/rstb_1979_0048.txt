tldr: 'This article discusses the assessment of sublethal effects of pollutants in the sea and the monitoring of biological effects. It focuses on separating natural changes from those induced by pollution and using stock-recruitment models to analyze the impact on fish populations. The authors emphasize the importance of understanding density-dependent mortality and the consequences of impact on fish stocks.'
