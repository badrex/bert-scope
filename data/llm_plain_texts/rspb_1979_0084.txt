revised_title: 'Reevaluating Adaptation and Natural Selection in Evolutionary Biology'
semantic_tags:
  - Evolutionary Biology
  - Adaptation
  - Natural Selection
  - Comparative Analysis
  - Confounding Variables
tldr: The authors argue that adaptation should be defined by its effects rather than its causes, emphasizing that adaptations may arise through various processes other than natural selection. They discuss the importance of considering confounding variables and the limitations of comparative evidence in understanding adaptation and natural selection in evolution.
