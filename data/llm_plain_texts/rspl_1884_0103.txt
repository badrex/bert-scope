tldr: The author examines enterochlorophyll, a type of chlorophyll found in animals, and studies its properties using spectroscopy and microscopy. They also analyze the stresses in the Earth's interior caused by the weight of continents and mountains, providing corrections to previous calculations and discussing the effects of these stresses on the planet's deformation.
