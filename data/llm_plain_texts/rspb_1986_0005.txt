tldr: This study investigates ion channels in rabbit cultured fibroblasts and discovers two types of high-conductance potassium channels. One type is similar to calcium-activated potassium channels found in many tissues, while the other type has a distinct voltage-dependence and is unaffected by intracellular calcium. These channels may play a role in controlling cell proliferation.
