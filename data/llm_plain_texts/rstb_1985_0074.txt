tldr: This study examines four fossil soils from the late Silurian and early Devonian periods to understand the environment and evolution during the advent of large plants and animals on land. The research focuses on the role of vegetation in soil formation and how it contributed to the colonization of land by multicellular organisms. The findings encourage further exploration of fossil soils as evidence for early ecosystems on land, providing insights into the changes that occurred during this critical period in Earth's history.
