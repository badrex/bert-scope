tldr: This study investigates the influence of cross-flow on the nonlinear interaction between Tollmien-Schlichting waves and vortices in a three-dimensional boundary layer. The research focuses on the effects of cross-flow on the behavior of the flow solution downstream from the input station. The authors find three distinct responses in the nonlinear behavior of the flow solution: an algebraic finite-distance singularity, far-downstream saturation, or far-downstream wave decay leaving pure vortex flow. These responses depend on the input conditions, wave angles, and the size of the cross-flow.
