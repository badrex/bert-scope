  - Plasmid stability
  - Catalyst deactivation
tldr: This article discusses the challenges of maintaining stability in recombinant cultures used in industrial fermentations. It explores the consequences of plasmid instability and catalyst deactivation, and suggests strategies for stabilizing these cultures, such as using plasmids with temperature-dependent copy numbers, environmental pressure, and recombination-deficient strains. The article also presents mathematical models for predicting the behavior of mixed cultures in batch and continuous fermentation processes.
