tldr: This article investigates the effect of lunar and solar tides on the ionosphere and upper atmosphere. The authors studied the diurnal and seasonal variations of the ionospheric region to understand the influence of solar altitude and local scale height. They found that the solar semi-diurnal barometric oscillation is about 28 times stronger than the corresponding lunar tide, despite the moon's gravitational effect being 180 times that of the sun. The study provides insights into the behavior of the upper atmosphere and its oscillations, which can help improve our understanding of atmospheric phenomena.
