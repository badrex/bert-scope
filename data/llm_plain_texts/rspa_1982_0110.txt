tldr: The authors studied the cool-flame combustion of decane and found that it involves two distinct mechanisms with a transition at 500-530 K. They analyzed the combustion products and discovered that hydroxyl radicals play a significant role in the process. The addition of hydrogen bromide caused the complete conversion of hydroperoxides into decanones, even at low temperatures.
