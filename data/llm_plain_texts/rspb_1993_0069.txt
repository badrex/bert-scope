tldr: The study examines the development of the light response in Drosophila photoreceptors and finds that during a critical developmental time window, photoreceptors cannot respond to light without the presence of Ca2+ in the whole-cell recording pipette. The researchers suggest that the failure to respond is due to insufficient Ca2+ in the Ins/ ^-sensitive intracellular stores, which are necessary for phototransduction in Drosophila.
