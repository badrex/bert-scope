tldr: This article discusses the evolution of the Precambrian crust, focusing on the development of high-grade terrains and greenstone belts. It highlights the importance of high-grade metamorphic rocks in understanding early crustal history and the role of plate tectonics in the Precambrian era. The article also emphasizes the need for more accurate radiometric age determinations to better understand the timing and processes of crustal development.
