tldr: The authors describe a centripetal vacuum pump that uses two circular metal plates, one stationary and the other rotating, to create a vacuum. The pump works by maintaining an air cushion between the plates, supporting the rotating plate. The authors explain the relationship between the distance between the plates, the speed of rotation, and the weight of the rotor to be supported. They also discuss the theoretical basis for the centripetal pumping effect and its dependence on the velocity gradient.
