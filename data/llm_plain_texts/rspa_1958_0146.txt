tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the flow of heat in liquid helium below 0.7 Kelvin. They observed the transition from open to viscous flow of phonons and determined the mean free path of phonons. The results showed that the effective thermal conductivity of liquid helium depends on the nature of the tube's surface and the mean free path of phonons.
