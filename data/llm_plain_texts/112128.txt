tldr: The author investigates the hydrocarbons of the series CnH2n+2 and explores the relationship between hydrocarbons and alcohol radicals. They find that the so-called radicals are actually part of the hydrocarbon series, and that the reaction between chlorine and these hydrocarbons can produce various compounds, including chlorides, alcohols, and their derivatives. This research helps clarify the differences between the hydrocarbon series and the alcohol radicals.
