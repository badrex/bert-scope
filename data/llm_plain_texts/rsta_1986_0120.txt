tldr: This article explores the generation of surface acoustic waves (SAWs) on aluminum using short laser pulses via the thermoelastic effect. The authors found that there is a simple relation between the temporal and spatial pulse width at which SAWs exhibit maximal amplitude. This technique plays an essential role in non-destructive testing, especially when the specimen needs to be tested at elevated temperatures or is not directly accessible.
