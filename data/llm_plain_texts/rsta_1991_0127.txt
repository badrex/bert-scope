tldr: This article explores a new method for selecting frequencies in chemometric analysis of complex stochastic systems. The method is easy to apply and demonstrated to be effective in predicting concentrations of ingredients in mixtures using infrared spectroscopy data. The study focuses on regression models and overfitting, proposing a simple technique for response selection that reduces the number of channels needed for analysis.
