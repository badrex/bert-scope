tldr: The authors discuss the physics and chemistry of biological recognition, focusing on chemical reaction paths. They propose using structural correlation to determine reaction pathways for various types of chemical reactions, including nucleophilic addition and elimination reactions at carbonyl groups. This approach can help understand molecular interactions and improve our knowledge of biological recognition processes.
