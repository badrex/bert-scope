tldr: This article discusses the evolutionary systematics of bivalve molluscs, focusing on their phylogenetic relations and early evolution. The authors propose a new subphylum classification for molluscs, dividing them into Peltophora and Cochleophora. They also describe the various stages of bivalve evolution, from their hypothetical monomyarian form to the formation of Autobranchia and Septibranchia, and the role of environmental changes in their development.
