tldr: The author presents a report to the Board of Admiralty discussing the employment of oblique forces in ship construction and the impact on ship stability. They analyze the distribution of forces acting on a ship, such as weight, pressure, and resistance, and propose methods to improve ship design and construction. The author also investigates the effects of longitudinal pressure and the curvature of ships, providing equations and calculations to support their findings.
