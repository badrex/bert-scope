tldr: Researchers discovered a new bacterial disease affecting culinary peas (Pisum sativum) that is transmitted through the interior of the seeds. The disease causes significant damage to the crop and is spread mainly through seeds. The researchers found a large rod-shaped bacillus responsible for the disease and discussed its characteristics, growth conditions, and transmission methods.
