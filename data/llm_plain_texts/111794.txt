tldr: This article is the second part of a paper discussing a class of differential equations and their applications in dynamical problems. It covers the theory of the Variation of Elements and the transformation of differential equations using new variables. The author provides examples of planetary and pendulum motions and explains how to determine the motion of a system of two planets using a specific system of axes.
