tldr: This article presents a computational study of early motion analysis, focusing on the measurement of motion in the changing image. The author proposes a method to compute an instantaneous two-dimensional velocity field from the changing image, using the physical assumption of smoothness to determine a unique velocity field. The study suggests that this computation may be a plausible explanation for motion measurement in the human visual system.
