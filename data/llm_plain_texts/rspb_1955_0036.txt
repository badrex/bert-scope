tldr: The author studied the adsorption of bacteriophages on sensitive and resistant cells of Escherichia coli strain B. They found that the susceptible host cells adsorb phages, while resistant strains do not. The adsorption isotherms are of the general Langmuir type, showing that phage adsorption is reversible. The author concludes that resistance is due to external exclusion of the bacterial virus.
