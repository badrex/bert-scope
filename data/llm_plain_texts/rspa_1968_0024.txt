tldr: The authors studied the catalytic decomposition of diethyl and di-n-propyl ethers on evaporated tungsten films in the presence of hydrogen. They found that the reactions initially produced ethane, ethylene, and butenes from diethyl ether, and propane and propylene from di-n-propyl ether. The decomposition of ethers occurred with zero-order kinetics after an initial high activity period. The authors also observed that the surface of the tungsten catalyst underwent irreversible changes during the reaction, affecting its activity.
