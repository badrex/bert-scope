tldr: 'The authors used radiocarbon dating to analyze peat samples from Scaleby Moss, Cumberland, and determined the age of different vegetation zones. They found that the Late-glacial/Post-glacial boundary was around 8300 BC, the Boreal/Atlantic boundary at about 5000 BC, and the Sub-boreal/Sub-atlantic boundary at about 3000 BC. This evidence supports the synchroneity of major vegetation zones across Europe and the usefulness of radiocarbon dating for studying Quaternary historical problems.'
