tldr: The author conducted a series of experiments to determine the fatigue limits of metals under alternating stress conditions. They tested various metals using bending and torsion fatigue tests, and found that the fatigue limits can be influenced by the chemical composition and mechanical properties of the metals. The results of these tests provide a better understanding of the relationship between stress intensity and the number of repetitions required for metal failure.
