tldr: The author, Charles Bell, discusses the functions of the facial nerves in the human body. He explains that the fifth pair of nerves controls sensibility and mastication, while the portio dura of the seventh pair controls facial movements related to respiration. Bell also refutes the practice of cutting the portio dura for the relief of tic douleureux. He provides examples of cases and anatomical descriptions to support his findings.
