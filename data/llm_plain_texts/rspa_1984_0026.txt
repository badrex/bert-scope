tldr: The authors developed an accurate method for analyzing the critical buckling loads of folded-plate structures with diaphragm-supported ends, loaded in combined biaxial compression and shear. The method uses a Rayleigh-Ritz energy approach and can be applied to isotropic or orthotropic plates, which are representative of laminated fiber-reinforced composites. The analysis has been incorporated into a general-purpose computer program called CAS1OPE1A, which can generate interaction curves relating critical values of compression and shear for any prismatic folded-plate structure.
