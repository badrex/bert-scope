tldr: 'Thomas Andrew Knight conducted experiments to understand the role of gravitation in seed germination and plant growth. He found that the radicles of germinating seeds always point downwards due to the influence of gravitation, while the germens point in the opposite direction. Knight concluded that gravitation is the main force guiding the growth of roots and stems in plants, and that this force helps plants adapt to their environment by preventing branches from growing downwards and allowing them to rise above their natural level.'
