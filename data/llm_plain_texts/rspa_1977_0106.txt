tldr: The author discusses the production of new particles and muon-electron events in electron-positron annihilation at the SPEAR storage ring. They analyze the properties of these particles, their quantum numbers, and decay modes, providing evidence that these new particles are hadrons and helping to expand our understanding of the hadron structure.
