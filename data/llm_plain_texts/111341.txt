tldr: This article presents observations made by Rear-Admiral Philip P. King during a voyage to measure the specific gravity of sea-water in various locations in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The author found that the density of ocean water is nearly identical in all parts of the Atlantic between 40° South latitude, with exceptions due to local factors. Factors affecting density include dry winds, rainfall, and coastal features. The author compares their findings with other observations made by various researchers.
