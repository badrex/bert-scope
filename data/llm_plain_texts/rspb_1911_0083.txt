tldr: The authors describe the inhibitive and fixation serum reactions in pulmonary tuberculosis and discuss the importance of controlling factors such as serum suspension and natural sheep-corpuscle amboceptor to obtain accurate results. They also outline the technique for the inhibitive reaction and the reaction of fixation, emphasizing the need for standardization and specificity in interpreting these reactions. This research contributes to the understanding and diagnosis of tuberculosis.
