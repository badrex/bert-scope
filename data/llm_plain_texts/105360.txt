tldr: The author, William Henry, shares an update on the case of William Carey, a young man suffering from ossification. After examining Carey's condition, physicians and surgeons decided to put him on a mercurial course, which led to some improvements in his condition. They applied mercurial plaisters to the ossified parts and advised Carey to bathe in the ocean and anoint his limbs with the soapy juice of the quercus marina. The author will continue to monitor Carey's progress and provide further updates.
