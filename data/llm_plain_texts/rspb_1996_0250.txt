tldr: The authors propose the genetic incompatibility hypothesis, suggesting that females may increase their reproductive success by mating with multiple males to reduce the risk of genetic incompatibility caused by intragenomic conflict. This hypothesis differs from other genetic benefit models of polyandry, as the fitness consequences depend on an interaction between maternal and paternal haplotypes, making it non-additive. The authors discuss various mechanisms, such as cellular endosymbionts, transposable elements, and segregation distorters, that can lead to genetic incompatibility and affect female reproductive success.
