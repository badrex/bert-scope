tldr: This study investigates the behavior of Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids in complex geometries, focusing on the interaction between two fluids with different material properties. The research uses visualization techniques and finite-element methods to analyze the flow characteristics and interfacial effects in various geometries. The findings have implications for practical problems such as coextrusion.
