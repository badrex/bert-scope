tldr: This article presents a new thermodynamic model for ball lightning, explaining its structure and stability. The model involves a hot plasma core, an intermediate zone for ion recombination, and a hydration zone where ions become hydrated. The surface of the ball undergoes thermochemical refrigeration, allowing the condensation of water and providing mechanical stability. The model can explain over 20 distinct properties of ball lightning, making it a consistent and comprehensive explanation for this mysterious phenomenon.
