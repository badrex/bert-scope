tldr: The author discusses the maintenance of genetic variation in natural populations and challenges the idea that heterozygous advantage is the primary factor. Instead, the author proposes that frequency-dependent selection, where predators, parasites, and competitors favor rare phenotypes, can explain the maintenance of genetic variation and continuous variation in both molecular and morphological characters.
