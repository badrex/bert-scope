tldr: The author, John Tyndall, discovered a new resemblance between carbonic acid and bisulphide of carbon. He observed that when bisulphide of carbon is exposed to radiation from hot carbonic acid, it behaves similarly to carbonic acid, absorbing more heat. This finding expands our understanding of the atomic structure and vibrations of these substances.
