tldr: The authors conducted research on the refraction, dispersion, and sensitivity of various liquids. They found that the refraction decreases as the temperature increases, and the spectrum's length diminishes with rising temperature. The study also revealed a connection between a liquid's sensitivity and its change in volume due to heat. The authors introduced the concept of "refractive energy" and "specific refractive energy" to describe the influence of substances on light rays.
