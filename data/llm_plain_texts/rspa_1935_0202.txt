revised_title: 'Composite Films of Oxygen and Hydrogen on Tungsten: Adsorption and Displacement'
semantic_tags:
  - Surface chemistry
  - Adsorption
  - Tungsten
  - Oxygen
  - Hydrogen
tldr: 'The authors studied the adsorption of oxygen on a hydrogen-covered tungsten surface and found that when oxygen is adsorbed, a hydrogen molecule is displaced. They also investigated the behavior of hydrogen on a surface partially covered with oxygen and discussed its implications for the problem of activated adsorption.'
