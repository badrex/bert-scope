tldr: This article discusses the electrical and magnetic properties of low-dimensional solids, focusing on the hierarchy of factors and the development of simplified models to understand their behavior. It explores inter- and intra-unit interactions, including electron transfer and localization, and the role of secondary factors such as electron-phonon couplings and electron-electron repulsions. The article highlights the complexity and variety of these compounds, leading to various crossover regimes and potential applications.
