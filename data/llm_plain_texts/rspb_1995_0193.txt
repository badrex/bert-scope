tldr: This article explores the evolution of dimorphism and separate sexes in schistosomes, blood parasites of mammals and birds. The authors propose that the transition from hermaphroditism to gonochorism in schistosomes was driven by selection for dimorphism and the need to expel eggs from the vertebrate circulatory system. They use an analytical model to evaluate the importance of factors such as inbreeding depression, sex allocation, parasite distribution within host populations, and egg liberation efficiency in the evolution of gonochorism in Schistosomatidae.
