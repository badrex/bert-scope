tldr: The author examines the optical and physical properties of Tabasheer, a substance found in bamboo. Tabasheer's unique ability to become more transparent when wet and opaque when dry is investigated. The author also studies the refractive power of Tabasheer and its ability to absorb various fluids, which can change its color and transparency. The research provides insight into the structure and composition of Tabasheer, as well as its potential applications.
