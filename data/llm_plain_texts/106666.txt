tldr: The author, William Austin, conducted experiments to examine the formation of volatile alkali and the affinities of phlogisticated and light inflammable airs. He discovered that when phlogisticated and light inflammable airs combine, they form volatile alkali. This process occurs when the two substances are in close proximity, such as when they are separated from solid or liquid substances. The specific gravity of inflammable air being less than phlogisticated air, the distance between its particles is greater, which affects their attraction and ability to combine. The author also found that when iron rusts in contact with water in the open air or in the earth, volatile alkali is formed, and this process may explain the frequent appearance of volatile alkali in the environment.
