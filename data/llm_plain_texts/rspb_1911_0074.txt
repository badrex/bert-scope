tldr: This study investigates the extent to which complement and amboceptor are withdrawn by subminimal amounts of antigen. The researchers found that these two substances are removed in the proportion they naturally exist in the serum. The liquid remaining after partial withdrawal is comparable to diluted normal serum. This work helps to understand the complex relationship between complement, amboceptor, and antigen in the immune system.
