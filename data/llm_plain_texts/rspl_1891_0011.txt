tldr: The authors investigated the Planté lead-sulphuric acid-lead peroxide cell and discussed the chemical changes occurring within it. They concluded that the cooling effect in the cell is due to the dissociation of dilute sulphuric acid, and the loss of efficiency is caused by the formation of peroxides in the electrolyte and excessive sulphating at the peroxide plate.
