tldr: The author investigates the green and orange band spectra of CaOH, CaOD, and calcium oxide using a vacuum arc and flame spectroscopy. They observe an isotope shift in the green band spectra when using heavy water vapor, supporting the assignment of these bands to CaOH. The author also compares the spectra obtained from different environments, such as air and water vapor, and discusses the relevance of their findings to the study of dissociation energies of alkaline earth oxides, spectrochemical analysis, and the absence of bands from stellar spectra.
