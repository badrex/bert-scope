tldr: This article discusses the results of experiments on various animals, focusing on monkeys, to study the localization of function in the brain. The author applies electrical stimulation and localized destructive lesions to the cerebral hemispheres to determine the regions responsible for specific movements and sensory perceptions. The study confirms the existence of specialized areas in the brain for different functions, such as movement, sensation, and cognition.
