tldr: This study investigates the thermal decomposition of branched-chain paraffin hydrocarbons, specifically the isomeric hexanes. The authors found that neo-hexane has a constant activation energy at different initial pressures, while other isomers show a pressure-dependent activation energy. The rate-pressure relationships for these isomers are expressed by a two-term equation, indicating the presence of two different reactions with varying pressure dependences. The authors discuss the physical interpretation of these contrasting types of behavior in different molecular species.
