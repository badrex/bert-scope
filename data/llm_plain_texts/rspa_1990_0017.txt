tldr: The article explores genetic algebras associated with self-incompatibility systems in plants. It investigates several systems, including pollen elimination and style height self-incompatibility, and introduces the concept of Lie admissible and pollen domination algebras. The study shows that certain self-incompatibility systems lead to isoplethic equilibrium populations.
