tldr: This article explores the evolutionary history of root-microbe symbioses in plants, focusing on the widespread arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis. The authors analyze the phylogenetic pattern of these associations and reveal that the non-mycorrhizal state is a derived characteristic, representing habitat and other forms of specialization. The study also discusses the other types of mycorrhizal and bacterial symbioses and their distribution patterns.
