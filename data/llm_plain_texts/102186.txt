tldr: The author, J. Flamsteed, provides an account of the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites in 1686 and shares a table of the parallaxes of their orbits. He also discusses the potential use of these observations to determine longitude at sea. Flamsteed offers a small instrument and a catalogue to help calculate the satellites' positions and distances, as well as an ephemeris for the year 1686.
