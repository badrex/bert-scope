tldr: This article presents experiments conducted to measure the specific heats of air, steam, and carbon dioxide at high temperatures. The author used an improved recording calorimeter to determine the heat passed into the walls from the gas at any instant after an explosion. The results provide valuable information on the specific heats of these gases, which can be used to improve our understanding of thermodynamics and energy transfer in gas mixtures.
