tldr: Dr. Thomas Young examines the forces acting on a ship's structure and the effectiveness of oblique riders and other alterations in ship construction. He discusses the strains caused by weight distribution, water pressure, and ocean waves, and evaluates the strength and utility of different construction methods, including those proposed by Mr. Seppings. Young concludes that while some experimental methods are promising, further research and cautious implementation are necessary.
