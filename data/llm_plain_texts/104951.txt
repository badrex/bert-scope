tldr: In 1755, various parts of the island experienced an extraordinary agitation of the waters without any noticeable motion of the Earth. This phenomenon was observed in docks, canals, ponds, and rivers, causing ships to rock and water levels to rise and fall dramatically. The event occurred simultaneously with more violent commotions of both Earth and Waters in distant parts of the globe. No tremor or motion of the Earth was felt during these incidents, and the cause of the water agitation remains a mystery.
