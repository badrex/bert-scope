revised_title: Characterization of Invariant Functionals in Crystal Defects
semantic_tags:
  - Crystal Defects

tldr: The authors study a class of functionals that are invariant under isochoric changes of domain and find that it contains strictly the null lagrangians. They provide a characterization of this class and discuss its implications for variational problems involving crystals with defects.
