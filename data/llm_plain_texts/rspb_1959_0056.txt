revised_title: 'Influence of Radiomimetic Substances on DNA Synthesis and Function in Bacteriophage Systems'

tldr: The authors investigated the effects of radiomimetic substances on deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis and function in Escherichia coli phage systems. They compared the inactivation of phages T2, T7, and two strains of T4 by alkylating agents. The results suggest that inactivation of bacteriophages by alkylating agents is due to a reaction with the DNA moiety, possibly leading to a failure in the injection process.
