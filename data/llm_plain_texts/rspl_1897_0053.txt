tldr: The author, Oliver Lodge, and his assistant, Benjamin Davies, conducted experiments to study the influence of a magnetic field on radiation frequency and spectral lines. They observed that the dark reversal line in the sodium spectrum partially disappeared when the flame was subjected to a concentrated magnetic field. This phenomenon, now known as the Zeeman effect, led to a better understanding of the interaction between light and magnetic fields, expanding the knowledge of electromagnetism and optics.
