tldr: This study investigates the chromatophore-system in higher crustaceans, focusing on the histology, pigments, and movements of chromatophores under various light conditions and backgrounds. The authors analyze the role of background in determining chromatophore movements and discuss the importance of background as a factor in color physiology. They also explore the chemistry of Crustacean pigments and their potential functions.
