tldr: The authors describe an efficient method for preparing 1:2:3-triaminopropane and explore its complex metallic compounds. They discuss the potential for isomerism and the development of new complex metallic compounds with triacidic amines. The study of these compounds could lead to a better understanding of their configuration and properties.
