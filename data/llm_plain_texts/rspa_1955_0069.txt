tldr: The authors investigate the thermo-electric power of metals, focusing on the influence of the lattice distribution and electron-phonon scattering. They find that in certain temperature ranges, the thermo-electric effect can show a sign opposite to the one predicted by the simple electron theory of metals. This phenomenon may have implications for understanding the behavior of thermo-electric power in certain materials, like alkali metals.
