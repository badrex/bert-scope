  - Amylolytic digestion
tldr: This article discusses experiments conducted by J. Norman Lockyer, which show that bile has a significant impact on both amylolytic and proteolytic digestion. The findings suggest that bile's role in digestion is not limited to breaking down starch but also plays a role in protein digestion.
