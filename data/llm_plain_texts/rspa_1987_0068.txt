revised_title: Reevaluation of Condensation Coefficient in Dropwise Condensation

tldr: The author reevaluates the condensation coefficient in dropwise condensation of steam, taking into account the polyatomicity of water molecules. They find an upper limit for the condensation coefficient to be 0.93, rather than the previously reported 0.6. The author concludes that, considering the approximate nature of the polyatomicity correction and uncertainties in the general theory of dropwise condensation, the data do not conclusively show that the condensation coefficient is less than unity.
