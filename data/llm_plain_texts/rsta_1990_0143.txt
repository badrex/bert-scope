tldr: The authors developed a three-colour resonance ionization method for secondary neutral mass spectrometry, enabling the detection of osmium at the parts per billion level and iron in silicon at less than 200 parts per trillion. This technique improves sensitivity and selectivity, allowing for more accurate trace analysis and depth profiling of atomic and molecular species in various materials.
