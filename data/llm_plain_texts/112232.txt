tldr: This article presents experimental research on the transmission of electric signals through submarine cables, focusing on the effects of cable length and signal speed. The author confirms the mathematical theory of signal transmission and establishes new facts about the limits of signal transmission and the impact of alternating current. The research also explores the use of reverse currents and the potential for confusion in signal transmission.
