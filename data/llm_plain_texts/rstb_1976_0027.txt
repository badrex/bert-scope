tldr: This article discusses the effects of low water potentials on the photosynthesis of higher plants. It explores how low leaf water potentials result in reduced photosynthesis due to decreased stomatal opening and inhibition of chloroplast activity. The production of new leaf area is also affected by water deficits, often leading to leaf senescence and reduced grain yield. The author emphasizes the need to re-evaluate the stomatal contribution to photosynthetic inhibition by drought and suggests that non-stomatal factors may also play a role.
