revised_title: 'Instantaneous Measurement of Muscle Metabolism using Muscle Haemoglobin'
semantic_tags:
  - Muscle Metabolism
  - Oxygen Saturation
  - Muscle Haemoglobin
  - Photoelectric Measurements
  - Muscle Contraction
tldr: The authors developed a method to measure the instantaneous oxygen consumption in muscle tissue during rest and contraction. They used muscle haemoglobin as an indicator of oxygen tension and found that it can act as a short-time oxygen store and intracellular indicator. The method provides a "metabolic microscope" with instant action, allowing for better understanding of muscle metabolism and its changes during contraction.
