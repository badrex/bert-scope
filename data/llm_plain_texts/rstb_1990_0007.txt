tldr: The study investigates the correlation between DNA hypomethylation and tissue-specific expression of the avian vitellogenin gene. The researchers found that demethylation of specific CpGs in the promoter region is associated with changes in protein-DNA interactions and the appearance of DNase I hypersensitivity sites. This suggests that DNA methylation plays a role in gene regulation and expression.
