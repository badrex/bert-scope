tldr: The author investigates the optical properties of free atoms and molecules, calculating the refraction produced by them. They also study the rate of rotation of polarization in a magnetic field, showing that it depends on the mass of the atoms. The formulae obtained are applied to oxygen to estimate the charge-to-mass ratios and the sum of the radii of the atoms.
