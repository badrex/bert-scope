tldr: The authors studied the electrophysiology and electron-microscopy of rat neuromuscular junctions after nerve degeneration. They found that the Schwann cell is the source of acetylcholine packages that evoke miniature end-plate potentials in denervated muscle. The presence of the Schwann cell is necessary but not sufficient for the production of miniature potentials at denervated end-plates.
