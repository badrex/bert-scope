tldr: The authors conducted a study to determine if cholesterol is conserved in the animal organism. They analyzed the cholesterol content in eggs and newly-hatched chicks and found that there was no significant increase in cholesterol during the incubation of the chick. This suggests that cholesterol is not synthesized in the organism and may be related to the animal's diet.
