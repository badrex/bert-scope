tldr: The authors develop a framework using the surface impedance tensor to study free surface waves in anisotropic elastic half-spaces. They provide a self-contained treatment of the subject, recovering and extending previous results, and establishing a definite existence criterion for numerical studies. This approach can also be used to study Stoneley waves in bonded anisotropic half-spaces.
