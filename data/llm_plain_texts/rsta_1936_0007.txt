tldr: The authors studied a general class of control systems with time-lags and aimed to provide guidance on optimizing constants in the relationship between the controlled quantity and the operation of the controlling gear. They focused on the stability and quick-acting nature of control systems, which are essential for practical applications. The research is applicable to various types of controlling gear and physical quantities, such as temperature, pressure, and content.
