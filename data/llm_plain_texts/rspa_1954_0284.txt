tldr: The authors investigated the thermal decomposition of ammonium perchlorate under different conditions, including vacuum and various temperatures. They found that only 30% decomposition occurred in the low-temperature range, and the remaining residue was still ammonium perchlorate. The decomposition process was influenced by factors such as temperature, particle size, and the presence of catalysts. The study provides insights into the unique characteristics of this solid decomposition reaction.
