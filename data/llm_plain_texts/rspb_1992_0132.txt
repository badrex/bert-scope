tldr: This study investigates the relationship between calcium-activated potassium currents and membrane potential in cochlear hair cells. The researchers found that these currents are dependent on membrane potential and can be explained by a simple diffusion model. This discovery helps to understand the complex processes of synaptic transmission and the role of ion channels in the nervous system.
