tldr: The authors studied the cyclization of Hevea rubber, a type of natural rubber, and found that the reaction follows a statistical cyclization law rather than a first-order equation. This discovery is important because it provides evidence that the polymer units participate in the rate-determining transition complex, supporting the accepted proton transfer mechanism. The research also confirms the dependence of cyclization rate on Hammett's acidity function.
