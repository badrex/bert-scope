tldr: This article investigates the physical properties of nitric acid solutions, focusing on densities and refractive indices. The authors discuss various sources of error and their possible impact on the results. They find that the contractions show a transition stage within a 1-2% range, and the values for refractive indices are not constant but decrease with increased concentration. The results are compared to existing formulas and illustrated with curves.
