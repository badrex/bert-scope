tldr: The author discusses the development of a theory of blood coagulation, focusing on the role of triggered enzyme systems in the clotting mechanism. They describe the two main triggers for clotting, contact activation and tissue extracts, and the various factors involved in the process. The author also highlights the importance of understanding these factors in treating clotting disorders like hemophilia.
