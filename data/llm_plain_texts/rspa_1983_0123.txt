tldr: The authors investigate the phenomenon of Jones birefringence, a type of linear birefringence, in crystals and fluids. They use pictorial symmetry arguments and the Mueller matrix method to identify systems where both linear birefringences can exist. The study shows that Jones birefringence can be induced in a fluid by applying uniform electric and magnetic fields, and it can occur naturally in certain magnetic and non-magnetic crystals. The findings provide a better understanding of the physical property tensors and the potential for measuring the effect in various media.
