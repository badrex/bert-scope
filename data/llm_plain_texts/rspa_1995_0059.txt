tldr: This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the statistical properties of polarimetric and interferometric synthetic aperture radar data using Gaussian and gamma-distribution models. It focuses on the properties of the Hermitian product of two channels, which is essential for understanding polarimetry and interferometry applications. The study covers single- and multi-look data, and discusses the estimation problem for the parameters characterizing the distributions.
