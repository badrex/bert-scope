tldr: The authors studied the absorption spectrum of cobalt chloride in concentrated hydrochloric acid and analyzed the complex band into seven components using a new model of the Hilger-Nutting spectrophotometer. They confirmed the existence and position of the absorption bands and discussed the relations between the bands in absorption spectra.
