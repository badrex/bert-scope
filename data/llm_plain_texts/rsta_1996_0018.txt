tldr: The article discusses the influence of human activities on the distribution of hydroxyl radicals in the troposphere. It presents three methods to estimate the distribution of hydroxyl radicals: the methyl chloroform method, coupled chemistry-transport models, and the 14CO method. The study finds that human activities, such as emissions of methane, carbon monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen, can affect the tropospheric distribution of hydroxyl radicals, leading to important consequences for global warming.
