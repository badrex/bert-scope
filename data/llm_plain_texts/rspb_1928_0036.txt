tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of external resistance on a runner's maximum speed. They added external resistance to the internal frictional resistance of muscles and found that it reduced the maximum speed as calculated by the equation of motion. The results confirmed the reality of internal resistance and showed that it behaves similarly to an external added resistance. This study helps in understanding the factors affecting a runner's speed and can be applied to calculate the impact of external factors like headwinds on a runner's performance.
