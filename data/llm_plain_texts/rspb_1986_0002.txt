tldr: This study presents a dynamical model of the cerebral cortex, focusing on its spatiotemporal receptive fields. The model, based on neuroanatomical findings, considers the cortex as a multi-input-multi-output system with layers that process information differently. The authors apply this model to the visual cortex, explaining some of the electrophysiologically measured neuronal response characteristics, such as receptive fields and their time dependence. The study emphasizes the importance of understanding the cortex's structure and function to better comprehend its information processing capabilities.
