tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the instability of liquid surfaces when accelerated in a direction perpendicular to their planes. They used an apparatus to accelerate liquids vertically downwards and observed the behavior of initial surface disturbances using high-speed shadow photography. The results showed that the increase in amplitude of the disturbances followed the first-order theory, and the instability eventually formed round-ended columns of air separated by narrow sheets of liquid.
