tldr: The authors investigate the interaction of a cooled metallic heat sink with a premixed lean flat ethylene/air flame. They measure the burning velocity distribution and obtain two-dimensional distributions of temperature and composition in the interaction region. The results reveal some unexpected features close to the heat sink, which are interpreted in terms of the composition pattern and the role of flame-surface interactions in flame structure studies.
