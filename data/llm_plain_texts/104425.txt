tldr: The author, H. W. Taube, describes a case of a navel rupture in a patient named Ann Stubbensfull. Despite the patient's attempts to treat the rupture, it continued to worsen. Taube and Dr. James Douglass planned to perform an autopsy after her death, but due to the patient's children's refusal and advanced decomposition, they were unable to do so.
