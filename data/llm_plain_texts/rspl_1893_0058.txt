tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the ratio of specific heats of paraffins and their monohalogen derivatives. They found that the gases fall into four groups, with similar ratios of specific heats, indicating that the energy-absorbing power of molecules with interchangeable atoms is the same. This study provides a link between the graphic formula of a gas and the dynamical properties of its molecules.
