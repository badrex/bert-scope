tldr: The author investigates the waterproofing process in the eggs of the bug Rhodnius prolixus. They discover that a thin layer of wax, similar to that found in insect cuticles, covers the inside of the chorion, providing the egg with waterproofing. The wax layer is secreted by the maturing oocyte and is attached to the innermost layer of the chorion. This waterproofing mechanism is distinct from the chorion and is essential for the egg's survival.
