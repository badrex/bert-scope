tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the excitation functions of barium reactions and the cosmogenic xenon in lunar samples. They found that the excitation functions show marked characteristics leading to variations in proton-induced xenon ratios as a function of energy. The results help explain the complex cosmogenic xenon component in lunar samples and provide insights into the Moon's history and formation.
