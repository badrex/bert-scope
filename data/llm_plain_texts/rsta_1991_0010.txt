tldr: The article reviews recent research on the effects of wind on ship rolling and capsizing. It discusses two main techniques: discrete gust models, where a sudden increase in wind speed causes a vessel to roll, and stochastic models, which consider a random sequence of wind pulses. The article also compares model experiments in a wind-wave tank and analyzes the impact of wind loading on vessel stability.
