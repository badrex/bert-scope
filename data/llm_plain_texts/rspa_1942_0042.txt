revised_title: The Effect of Thermal Vibrations on X-ray Scattering
semantic_tags:
  - X-ray scattering
  - Thermal vibrations
  - Elastic constants
  - Crystal lattice
  - Background scattering
tldr: This article explores the effect of thermal vibrations on the scattering of X-rays, focusing on the background scattering and extra spots near Laue spots. The author shows that only the acoustical branches of the elastic spectrum can produce extra spots, and discusses the temperature dependence of the background intensity.
