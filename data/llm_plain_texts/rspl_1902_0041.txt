tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of varying amounts of carbon dioxide in the air on plant growth and structure. They found that plants grown in air with a higher concentration of carbon dioxide had stunted growth, larger leaves, and more stomata. The study also showed that the additional carbon dioxide did not increase the amount of starch in the plants' leaves or stem parenchyma.
