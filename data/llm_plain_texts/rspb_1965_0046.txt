tldr: The article describes a technique for isolating and maintaining the supradiaphragmatic portion of a rat as a functioning unit, excluding the liver, kidneys, and intestines from the circulation. This method allows for physiological studies without interference from these organs. The technique also provides suitable methods for injecting fluids into the vascular system and sampling blood.
