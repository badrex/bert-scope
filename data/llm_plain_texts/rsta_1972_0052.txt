tldr: The authors study resistive instabilities in hydromagnetic equilibria, focusing on the sheet pinch model with uniform resistivity. They analyze the asymptotic properties of the critical layer equations and provide a novel mathematical approach to understand the slow interchange mode, rapid interchange modes, and oscillatory resistive modes. The results help in understanding the behavior of plasmas in controlled thermonuclear reactors.
