tldr: This article discusses recent advancements in the technique of seismic recording and analysis, focusing on the quantitative evaluation of teleseismic explosion records. The authors examine the elastic model for teleseismic signals and consider instrumental and non-elastic effects on the recorded signals. They provide examples of computed signals from underground explosions and discuss the implications of their findings for understanding the Earth's crust and mantle properties.
