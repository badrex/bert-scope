revised_title: Electronic Wave Functions: Theorems for Evaluating Schrödinger Integrals
semantic_tags:
  - Quantum Mechanics

tldr: The authors present theorems that simplify the evaluation of Schrödinger integrals for vector-coupled functions, reducing the labor of calculation and providing alternative methods for evaluating two-electron integrals. These methods are useful in convergent variational calculations of atomic wave functions and applicable to various problems requiring the evaluation of Schrödinger integrals.
