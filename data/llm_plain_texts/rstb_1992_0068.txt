tldr: This article investigates the psychophysics of concurrent sound segregation, focusing on two potential cues: differences in fundamental frequency (Fo) and frequency modulation (fm) coherence. The authors conducted experiments to determine if listeners can detect fm incoherence and if across-frequency processing plays a role in perceptual sound segregation. The results suggest that listeners are not sensitive to fm incoherence and that across-frequency comparisons of fm coherence do not contribute to perceptual sound segregation.
