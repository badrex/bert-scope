tldr: The study investigates the relationship between the structure and innervation of small arteries and arterioles and the membrane potential changes expected at different levels of sympathetic nerve activity. The authors calculate the membrane potential changes in arterial smooth muscle due to natural sympathetic nerve activity, considering the electrical properties of the smooth muscle syncytium and various assumptions about noradrenaline release. The results suggest that the depolarization would be irregular and that discrete excitatory junction potentials would not be recorded during natural nerve activity. The irregularity of depolarization would be greater in small arterioles, causing them to reach the threshold for action potential generation at lower frequencies of nerve activity than larger arteries.
