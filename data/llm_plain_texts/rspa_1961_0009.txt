tldr: The authors studied the transfer of unsaturated helium II films on glass and german silver surfaces using a heat conduction method. They found that the critical transfer rate decreases when the vapor pressure over the film is slightly below the saturation value. The critical temperature for the onset of superfluidity is independent of the substrate, and the temperature dependence of the transfer rate is different from that of the saturated film.
