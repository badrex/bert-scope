tldr: This article presents an approach to analyze the structural dynamics of ships using modal analysis with dry modes. By employing the principal modes of the ship in vacuo, it maintains simpler orthogonality relations without depending on approximate techniques for estimating fluid forces. The authors also discuss the role of hydrodynamic theory in calculating fluid actions and how time history effects can be incorporated into strength calculations for the first time.
