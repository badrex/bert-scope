tldr: The author, Henry Nelson, provides a detailed anatomical and developmental study of the Ascaris Mystax, a parasitic worm found in the domestic cat's intestinal canal. The article describes the reproductive process in both sexes, focusing on the formation and function of the seminal cells and the generative apparatus of the female. It also explains the fertilization process, embryonic development, and the formation of the young Ascaris. The author's observations were verified using a camera lucida to create accurate illustrations.
