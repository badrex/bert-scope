tldr: This article explores the diffusion of light by rain, cloud, and fog, and how it affects visibility and illumination. The author explains the relationship between the size of water droplets and their ability to scatter light, and how this impacts the intensity of light at different distances. The study also discusses the connection between light diffusion and heat conduction, and the factors that influence visibility in various weather conditions.
