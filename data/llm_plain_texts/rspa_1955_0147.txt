tldr: The author investigates meteor radiation, ionization, and atomic luminous efficiency, calculating the luminous efficiency of various excited states of atoms and ions commonly found in meteors. They find that meteor iron and stone have similar visual luminous efficiency per unit mass, and determine coefficients of active attachment and luminous efficiencies of recombination for important ions using an order-of-magnitude procedure.
