tldr: This article explores the molecular approaches to nerve regeneration, focusing on the role of nerve growth factor (NGF) and its receptor. The authors study the mechanism of action of NGF and identify novel gene sequences regulated during regeneration. They also analyze the structure and function of the NGF receptor, providing insights into its binding domain and the role of cysteine-rich sequences in NGF binding.
