tldr: The authors extend the theory of the anomalous skin effect to uniaxial anisotropic metal crystals with two energy bands, where the energy surfaces are ellipsoids of revolution. They derive explicit expressions for the surface impedance and discuss the extreme anomalous limit. The anisotropy of the surface impedance depends on the axial ratios of the spheroidal energy surfaces and the ratio of electron free paths in the two bands. The findings can explain the surface resistance variations observed in anisotropic metals under anomalous skin effect conditions.
