tldr: The author presents a theoretical approach to understanding the ionic distribution in liquid silicates, treating them as complex melts with varying polymeric silicate anions. The study focuses on binary melts with high silica content, using equilibrium constants and ion fractions to calculate the distribution of silicate anions. The findings can help interpret the results of recent work on slag-metal equilibria and provide insights into the properties of liquid silicates.
