tldr: The author conducted experiments on cherry laurel leaves to study the diurnal rhythm of carbon dioxide assimilation. They discovered that the rate of assimilation is influenced by the external supply of carbon dioxide and the light intensity. The experiments showed a well-marked diurnal rhythm, with a depression in assimilation during the night and a recovery in the morning. This research helps to understand the factors affecting plant growth and photosynthesis.
