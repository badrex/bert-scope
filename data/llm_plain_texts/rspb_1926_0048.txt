tldr: The authors observed the recovery process from stasis in the capillary vessels of a rat's mesentery. They discovered that the capillary walls regain their impermeability and the circulation is re-established through a series of processes involving the movement of blood cells. This research provides insights into the mechanisms of blood circulation and stasis recovery.
