tldr: The article discusses the development of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging techniques for whole body scans and the detection of breast tumors. The authors describe their progress using high-speed echo planar imaging and present preliminary results obtained at 15.0 and 4.0 MHz. They demonstrate the potential of NMR imaging for diagnosing tumors by measuring relaxation times and detecting differences in tissue characteristics.
