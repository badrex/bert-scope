tldr: This article presents a comprehensive study of the infra-red spectrum and crystal structure of gypsum. The authors obtained infra-red spectra of single gypsum crystals and analyzed the observations in combination with previous results on the Raman spectrum. This allowed them to assign most of the internal fundamental modes of the sulfate ions and water molecules in the crystal. The study provides insights into the crystalline field and the forces between atoms in the crystal lattice, as well as the effect of hydrogen bonding on the structure of hydrated crystals.
