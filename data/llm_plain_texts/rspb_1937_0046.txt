tldr: The authors conducted a study to investigate the linkage between genes for colour-blindness and haemophilia in humans. They found that both conditions occur in the same family, suggesting a genetic connection. The study provides evidence for the existence of linkage between these two genes, but the intensity of the linkage is not yet established with accuracy.
