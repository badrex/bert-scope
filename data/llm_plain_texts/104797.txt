tldr: The author presents a new hypothesis about the origin of petrifactions found in the Earth, which challenges the widely accepted belief that they were caused by the universal deluge. Instead, the Italian author, Anton Moro, suggests that marine petrifactions were formed by subterranean fire. He provides evidence from various geological events, such as the eruption of Mount Vesuvius and the formation of new islands, to support his theory.
