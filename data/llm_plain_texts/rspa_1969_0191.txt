tldr: The authors study the dependence of surface wave frequencies in a canal on the curvature of its cross-sectional shape. They derive an equation for the coefficient of the large eigenvalues and test its accuracy by calculating eigenvalues for a semicircular canal. The results provide insight into the behavior of surface waves in canals with different cross-sectional curvatures.
