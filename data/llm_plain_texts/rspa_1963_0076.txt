tldr: The authors investigated the structure and stability of black foam films, focusing on the thickness and composition of thin films formed from sodium dodecyl sulfate solutions. They used techniques to simultaneously measure film thickness and water content, and determined the relationship between the composition of the surface layer at the bulk solution/air interface and at the film/air interface. The study provides insights into the factors influencing the stability of thin films and the molecular orientation of surface-active species at the film/air interface.
