tldr: In November 1887, a large meteor exploded over southern England, causing a loud sound and shaking experienced as an earthquake. G. J. Symons investigated the event, suggesting it was due to an explosive bolide rather than an earthquake. The meteor's explosion was heard or felt over an area of more than 2000 square miles, with the main path extending from Wiltshire to Newmarket, Cambridgeshire.
