tldr: The author, Stephen Hales, discovered a method to distill large quantities of water with minimal fuel by blowing showers of fresh air through distilling liquors. This innovative technique significantly increased the efficiency of the distillation process, making it more suitable for use on ships. The method has the potential to greatly benefit navigation by allowing for faster and more fuel-efficient distillation of water.
