tldr: This article discusses tide observations made at Liverpool and compares them to Bernoulli's theory of tides. The author presents tables to exhibit the diurnal inequality in the height of high water and explains the difference in the law of intervals between London and Liverpool. The results of observation show a remarkable agreement with Bernoulli's theory and the formulae representing it.
