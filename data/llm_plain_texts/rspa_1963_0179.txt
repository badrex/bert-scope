tldr: This article investigates the effects of pH on the radiolysis of aqueous solutions, focusing on the reactions of solvated electrons and the role of hydrogen ions. The authors study the radiation chemistry of solutions containing acrylamide and potassium ferrocyanide and ferricyanide, and find that increasing hydrogen ion concentration makes available isolated pairs of atoms and OH radicals, which can react with solutes. This research provides insights into the radiation chemistry of aqueous solutions and the behavior of solvated electrons.
