tldr: A survey of the land snail fauna on Porto Santo, an isolated island in the Madeiran archipelago, reveals a species-rich fauna with a high percentage of endemic species. The study finds that the distribution patterns of these species can be attributed to both adaptive and non-adaptive radiation, with the latter being a result of allopatric divergence in isolation by species that retain similar niches. The island's topography provides a cluster of refuges for land molluscs, allowing for independent evolution on each one. Differences in distribution patterns between families are likely due to their evolution at different times in the island's history.
