tldr: The author investigates the reaction of sulfuric acid with amides and nitriles, leading to the formation of conjugate disulfonic acids. The study includes experiments on various groups of compounds, such as ethyl, propyl, and benzonitrile series. The author also discusses the possibility of a general mode of formation for disulfonic compounds in organic bodies capable of uniting with anhydrous sulfuric acid.
