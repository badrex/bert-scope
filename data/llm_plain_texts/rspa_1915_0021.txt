tldr: The author investigates the effect of catalysts on the formation of active nitrogen through electric discharge. They find that certain catalysts, such as copper and phosphorus, can promote the formation of active nitrogen, which is associated with a glow in the gas. The author also discusses the controversy surrounding the role of oxygen in the formation of active nitrogen and presents their experimental findings on the subject.
