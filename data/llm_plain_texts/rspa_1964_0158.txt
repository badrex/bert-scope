tldr: The authors studied the sorption properties of synthetic mordenites, focusing on the influence of alkali and alkaline-earth counter-ions on inclusion within crystalline zeolites. They found that the main channels in mordenite are nearly filled by molecules as large as benzene and neopentane, while sorption in the small cavities lining the main channels is limited to molecules smaller than butane. The authors also investigated the energetics of inclusion and provided a chemical formula for the mordenite used in their study.
