tldr: The authors, Worthington and Cole, conducted experiments to study the impact of a liquid surface using instantaneous photography. They developed a method to simultaneously release a metal timing-sphere and a liquid drop, which created a splash at the moment the timing-sphere passed between two charged Leyden jars. The photographs captured detailed information about the splash, providing a better understanding of the phenomena and improving upon previous drawings and observations.
