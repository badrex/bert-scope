revised_title: 'Electron Impact Spectroscopy: Threshold Energy-Loss Spectra for Unsaturated Molecules'
semantic_tags:
  - Electron impact spectroscopy
  - Molecular structure
  - Electron energy-loss spectra
  - Electron-trap method
  - Trochoidal electron monochromator
tldr: The authors developed an electron-trap method combined with a trochoidal electron monochromator to study threshold electron energy-loss spectra for unsaturated molecules like nitrogen, ethylene, and others. This technique helps in detecting spin-forbidden transitions and provides valuable information about molecular structure and electronic transitions.
