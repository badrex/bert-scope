tldr: This article discusses the potential damage caused by intensive arable cultivation on soil structure and productivity. It highlights the importance of understanding soil physical conditions for crop growth and the need for improved techniques to measure soil pore size distribution. The author suggests that damage from intensive cultivation can be temporary or permanent, depending on the soil type and the extent of compaction. The article also emphasizes the potential benefits of no-till farming methods and the need for further research to establish optimum soil physical conditions for maximum crop production.
