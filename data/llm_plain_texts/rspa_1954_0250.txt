tldr: The article investigates the slip modes of titanium and how the purity of the material affects their occurrence during tensile deformation of single crystals. The study finds that the interstitial impurity not only affects the magnitude of the critical resolved shear stress but also the relative values for the three slip systems. Increasing purity favors the (10T0) slip system. The possible role of oxygen and nitrogen in this effect is discussed, showing that interstitial elements make slip more difficult on two of the three slip planes in titanium.
