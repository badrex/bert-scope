tldr: This article discusses the analysis of a meteoric stone found at Makariwa, near Invercargill, New Zealand. The stone consists of an intimate admixture of metallic matter (nickel iron) and stony material. The specific gravity of the stone varies due to the unequal distribution of metallic particles. A partial chemical examination was made, and a complete analysis will be communicated to the society.
