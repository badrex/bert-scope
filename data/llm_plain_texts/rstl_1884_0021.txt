tldr: The author discusses the comparative morphology of leaf development in vascular cryptogams and gymnosperms, arguing that the distinction between the foliar base and upper leaf should not be applied to branched leaves. They emphasize the importance of understanding the mode of origin and sequence of appearance of leaf parts and their relationships, rather than focusing on the effects of growth distribution.
