tldr: James Ferguson improved the celestial globe by adding a new mechanism that accurately shows the apparent motions of the Sun and Moon. This improvement allows for better observation of lunar and solar phenomena, such as rising and setting times, amplitudes, and their relationship with fixed stars. The new design also enables more precise study of the Earth's polar regions and their unique celestial phenomena.
