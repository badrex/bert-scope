tldr: This article investigates the wave-induced stress in ships executing symmetric motions and proposes a unified approach to analyze the dynamic nature of the loading and response of the ship's structure. The authors examine the behavior of a ship in waves and discuss the phenomenon of ship-wave matching and resonant encounter, which contribute to the fluctuating stresses in large or flexible ships in confused seas. The study aims to develop a unified theory to bridge the gap between hydrodynamics and structural analysis, leading to better methods for ship design.
