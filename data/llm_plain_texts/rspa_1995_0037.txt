tldr: This study investigates the internal structure and behavior of Taylor vortices in both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids. The research focuses on the effects of fluid rheology on tangential and axial velocity distributions within Taylor vortices. The findings reveal that the internal vortex structure changes with increasing Taylor number, and the non-Newtonian fluids, such as Xanthan gum and Laponite/CMC aqueous blend, exhibit different characteristics compared to the Newtonian fluid, an aqueous solution of glucose.
