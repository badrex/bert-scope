tldr: The authors measured the excitation temperatures of C2 and CN radicals generated in a shock tube by the pyrolysis of cyanogen and acetylene. They used a brightness and emissivity method with a xenon flash tube as a background source. The results provide insights into the processes leading to the formation of electronically excited radicals in high-temperature gas reactions.
