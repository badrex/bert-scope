tldr: The authors study the formation of nonlinear vortices in the Stokes layer on an oscillating cylinder. They find that depending on the Taylor number of the flow, three distinct types of vortex behavior occur. The study provides insights into the nature of centrifugally-driven instabilities in flows over curved surfaces, which can be applied to other fluid dynamics problems.
