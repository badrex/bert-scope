tldr: The author discusses the concept of springiness in hard bodies and how it relates to the motion of reflecting bodies. They explain that all motions between hard bodies can be accounted for by the presence of a spring-like force. The author provides various experiments and demonstrations to support their claims, concluding that this understanding can help explain the behavior of hard bodies with unequal weights.
