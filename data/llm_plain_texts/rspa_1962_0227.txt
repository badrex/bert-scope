revised_title: A Discussion on the Present State of Relativity: Quantization of the Gravitational Field

tldr: This article discusses the challenges of quantizing the gravitational field in flat space and proposes a method to avoid these issues. The author suggests working with path-dependent variables, which are independent of the coordinate system, to create a theory that is manifestly covariant and does not introduce unphysical states or an indefinite metric.
