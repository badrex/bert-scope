tldr: The author demonstrates the properties of an engine for turning ovals in wood or metal and the instrument for drawing ovals on paper. The article explains the principles behind the engine and the trammels, and how they can be used to create various shapes and designs. It also discusses the challenges in turning ovals, such as the angle of deviation and the effect of tool design on the final shape.
