tldr: The authors conducted experiments on gaseous spectra of hydrogen and nitrogen to understand their physical properties and their relation to celestial bodies like the Sun, stars, and nebulae. They found that the temperature of nebulae is lower than that of the Sun and that their tenuity is excessive. The authors also suggested that spectrum analysis could help increase our knowledge of the physical constitution of these celestial bodies.
