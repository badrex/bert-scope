revised_title: 'The Role of Lymph Corpuscles in Intestinal Absorption and Chyle Formation'
semantic_tags:
  - Intestinal absorption
  - Lymph corpuscles
  - Chyle formation
  - Amoeboid cells
  - Nutrient transference
tldr: The author investigates the role of lymph corpuscles in the absorption of nutrients, particularly fats, from the intestine into the lacteals. They discovered that these amoeboid cells actively participate in the transference and assimilation of food materials, including fats, by migrating into the lacteals and breaking down, releasing nutrients into the chyle. This process is not limited to fats, as other substances can also be conveyed in a similar manner.
