tldr: The author investigates the mechanism and molecula statistics of the reaction between CuSO4路5H2O and CuSO4路H2O + 4H2O. They discuss the role of the interface between two solid phases and the influence of temperature and water vapor pressure on the reaction rate. The author also examines the formation of hydrates and the general mechanism of the reaction.
