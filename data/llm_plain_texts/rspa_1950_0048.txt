tldr: The author investigates the dispersion of pressure pulses in the atmosphere caused by explosions. They develop a mathematical model to calculate the pressure oscillations at various distances from the explosion, taking into account the Earth's atmosphere as a horizontally stratified medium. The results are compared with observed oscillations from historical events like the Great Siberian Meteorite and the eruption of Krakatoa.
