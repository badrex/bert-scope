tldr: 'The authors discovered a substance called lysozyme present in tissues and secretions that can rapidly dissolve certain bacteria. They found that lysozyme is effective against a variety of bacteria, including the Micrococcus lysodeikticus, and can be found in various body fluids, animal tissues, and even egg whites. The study demonstrates the potential use of lysozyme as a natural defense mechanism against bacterial infections.'
