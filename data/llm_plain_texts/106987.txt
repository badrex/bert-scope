revised_title: Investigating the Chemical Properties Attributed to Light
semantic_tags:
  - Light properties
  - Heat generation
  - Chemical reactions
  - Color change
  - Oxide of metals
tldr: The author conducted experiments to investigate the chemical properties attributed to light. They discovered that the heat generated by light absorption can cause color changes in metal oxides. The author found that exposing metal oxides to sunlight caused color changes, while keeping them in the dark did not. This research sheds light on the intensity of heat generated by light absorption and its potential effects.
