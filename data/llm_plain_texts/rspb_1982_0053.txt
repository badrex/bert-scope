tldr: The study examines the behavior of the gastropod Nerita polita L. on different shores of Aldabra Atoll. The species shows a plasticity in its activity, adapting to the actual morphology of the coast and its exposure to wave action. The snails are mostly active during nocturnal low tide and dig into the sand during high tide and diurnal low tide. The study found that the activity pattern of N. polita follows an integrated diurnal-tidal rhythm, with the distribution of active snails changing during the spring-neap cycle.
