tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the vapour-pressures of solids and liquids, focusing on ice, steam, camphor, benzene, acetic acid, and water. They discovered that the vapour-pressure of a solid is less than that of a liquid at the same temperature, and this difference can be calculated from thermic data. The new method of determining vapour-pressures of solids and liquids offers significant advantages and is applicable to various chemical types.
