tldr: The author, Nevil Maskelyne, critiques the method of calculating the equation of time used in the French Almanac, "Connoissance des Mouvements Celestes." He argues that the equation of the equinoctial points should not be taken into account when computing the equation of time, as it does not affect the sun's or stars' passage to the meridian. Maskelyne provides a new method for calculating the equation of time, which takes into consideration the nutation of the Earth's axis.
