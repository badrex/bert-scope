tldr: The author, C. Schorlemmer, investigates the existence and properties of normal propyl alcohol and its chloride. They discovered a method to synthesize normal propyl chloride by replacing iodine in secondary propyl iodide with hydrogen and then reacting with chlorine. The author also found that the second substitution product of propane is propylene dichloride, which has implications for substitution theories.
