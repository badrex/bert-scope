tldr: The authors conducted an experimental kinetic study of the silver-catalyzed oxidation of methanol and used infrared spectroscopy to examine adsorbed species under reaction conditions. They found that formaldehyde is formed by gas-phase methanol interacting with dissociatively adsorbed oxygen. A kinetic two-step model was formulated based on the experimental evidence, providing a good fit to the experimental data.
