tldr: This article discusses the evolution of melanism in Lepidoptera species, specifically the theory of selection for melanism in these insects. The authors explore the role of bird predators in the selection process and the genetic factors that contribute to the change in melanism frequencies in populations. They also consider the potential impact of environmental factors, such as pollution, on the evolution of melanism in these species.
