tldr: In 1810, a ship called the Triumph encountered a Spanish vessel carrying quicksilver that had wrecked near Cadiz. The quicksilver was stored in bladders within barrels, but when the bladders rotted, the metal mixed with the provisions and affected the crew, causing ptyalism and ulcerated throats. The air in the confined parts of the ship contained mercurial vapour, and those sleeping and eating in the orlop and lower decks were more severely affected. This case study highlights the health hazards of mercury poisoning and the importance of proper storage and handling of such substances.
