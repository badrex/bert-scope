tldr: The article studies the optical caustics produced by liquid drop lenses with fourfold symmetry. The authors use catastrophe theory to analyze the effects of varying the drop's shape and size, and the role of gravity. They find that the caustic patterns are organized by the lowest catastrophe of corank 2 to possess a modulus, and explain the observed details by taking into account the higher catastrophe A theory of the drop profile under the combined effects of surface tension and gravity.
