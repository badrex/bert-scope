tldr: The authors studied the behavior of palladium in occluding hydrogen and oxygen. They found that palladium black, sponge, and foil have different properties in absorbing gases. The heat evolved during the occlusion of hydrogen was measured, and the atomic ratio of palladium to hydrogen was determined for various forms of palladium. The results suggest that the occlusion of hydrogen by palladium is a true phenomenon of oxidation.
