tldr: The article is a biography of William George Penney, a distinguished mathematician who played a significant role in the development and testing of British nuclear weapons. Penney's early scientific work focused on the application of quantum mechanics to solid-state physics and the theory of the chemical bond. During World War II, he worked on blast effects, Mulberry Harbours, and later joined the British team at Los Alamos Laboratory to contribute to the development of the atomic bomb. His expertise and ability to explain complex scientific problems to laymen made him a valuable member of the team.
