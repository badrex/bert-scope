tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the dielectric constant of ice and alcohol at very low temperatures. They used a condenser with ice as the dielectric and measured its capacity at different temperatures. The results showed that the dielectric constant of ice decreased as the temperature dropped, and the authors planned to improve their methods for more accurate measurements in the future.
