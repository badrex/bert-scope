tldr: The authors compare the distorted-wave method and the Born-Oppenheimer approximation for calculating cross-sections of helium excitation by electron impact. They find that the distorted-wave method provides more accurate results, especially near the threshold energy, and discuss the implications of their findings for astrophysics, atmospheric physics, and plasma research.
