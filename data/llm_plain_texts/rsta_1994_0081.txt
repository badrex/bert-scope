tldr: The article discusses the self-ordering and form in polymeric materials, specifically focusing on nematic polymers and elastomers. Nematic order can occur in polymers with rod-like elements in the main chain or side chains. The article explores the effects of nematic ordering on the shape and properties of these materials, including molecular shape changes, rubber elasticity, and the response to external fields.
