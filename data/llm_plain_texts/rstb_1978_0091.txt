tldr: This article discusses the non-photosynthetic functions of carotenoids in plants, specifically their role in protecting cells against potentially damaging photochemical reactions. Carotenoids achieve this through three separate mechanisms: quenching the triplet state of chlorophyll, physically inactivating the highly reactive singlet state of oxygen, and serving as an oxidizable substrate to protect other molecules from photodestruction. These protective effects have been observed in various non-photosynthetic systems, highlighting the importance of carotenoids in the survival of aerobic life on Earth.
