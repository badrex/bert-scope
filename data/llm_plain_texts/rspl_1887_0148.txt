tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the relative densities of hydrogen and oxygen gases. They used eudiometric methods to measure the atomic volumes of the gases and found that hydrogen has a lower density than oxygen, confirming Prout's Law. The author also discussed various methods for preparing and purifying the gases for accurate measurements.
