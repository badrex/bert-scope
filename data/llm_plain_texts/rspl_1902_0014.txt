tldr: The author discusses the importance of impurities in determining chemical change and electrical conduction in gases. They argue that the presence of impurities, such as water and electrolytes, is necessary for chemical reactions to occur and for electrical discharges to take place in gases. The author also highlights the need for better experimental techniques and equipment to study these phenomena accurately.
