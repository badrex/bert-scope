tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the specific volumes of various chemical compounds, including bromine, iodine monochloride, ethene dibromide, and ethene chloride. They found that the compounds with greater molecular weights have greater specific volumes. The study also showed that bromine and iodine monochloride preserve their volumes when in a compound state.
