tldr: The authors developed a modified Knudsen effusion system to measure the very low vapour pressures of radioactive compounds, focusing on the latent heat of sublimation of mercury diphenyl. They found a figure of 3.5 kcal/mol for the latent heat of sublimation at 25°C. This research contributes to understanding the thermochemistry of organometallic compounds and estimating the mean energies involved in metal-carbon bonds.
