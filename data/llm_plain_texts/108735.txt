tldr: This study examines the weights of the human body and internal organs in both sane and insane individuals of various ages, based on 2614 post-mortem examinations. The research aims to establish a standard for the weight of human organs from infancy to old age, providing insights into the average height, weight, and organ weights in different age groups and sexes. The findings reveal that the body and internal organs generally reach their full size between 20 and 30 years of age, with males having a higher average weight than females. The study also highlights the prevalence of diseases and their impact on organ weights and overall health.
