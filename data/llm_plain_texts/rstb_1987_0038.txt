tldr: This article examines the effects of oil and gas platform discharges on benthic macrofauna in the North Sea. It discusses the changes in community structure, species richness, and individual abundances near platforms. The study reveals that some platforms have a positive impact on benthic communities, while others cause significant declines in numbers of individuals. The article highlights the importance of monitoring and managing the environmental impact of offshore activities.
