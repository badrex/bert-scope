tldr: Researchers Erik Svensson and Jan-Ake Nilsson discovered that female blue tits can manipulate their offspring's sex ratio based on the quality of their mates. High-quality male blue tits produce more sons, while lower-quality males produce more daughters. This finding provides evidence that mate quality contributes to sex ratio variation in a natural bird population.
