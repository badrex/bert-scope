tldr: The author, A. S. Eddington, investigates the interaction of electric charges and proposes a new way to understand space-time using matrix theory. They introduce the concept of space-vectors with five components, which can be rotated like vectors in the elementary theory of vectors. Eddington identifies this 5-dimensional domain with real space-time, where three dimensions are spacelike and two are timelike. This domain allows for all rotations of space axes, a rotation between the two time axes, and Lorentz transformations between any space axis and either time axis.
