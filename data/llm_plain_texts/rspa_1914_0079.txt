tldr: The author conducted a comprehensive study of the silicon spectrum using high-purity samples to accurately tabulate the wavelengths of lines in the silicon spectrum. They discovered discrepancies in previous observations due to impurities in the samples and used various methods to improve the accuracy of their measurements. The study is important for physical astronomy and understanding the properties of silicon in stars.
