tldr: This article discusses the location and function of peptidergic neurons in the central nervous system. It explores the importance of anatomical information for future biochemical, physiological, and pharmacological studies and emphasizes the need for more biochemical data before definitive peptide mapping studies can be done. The article also focuses on two systems of peptide-containing neurons: those that produce neurohypophysial hormones and those that produce a-MSH, ACTH, and endorphin.
