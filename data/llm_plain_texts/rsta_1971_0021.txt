tldr: The authors conducted a systematic survey of rare-earth abundances in submarine tholeiitic basalts along mid-ocean ridges using neutron activation analysis. They found that these basalts are distinguishable from other oceanic rocks and contrast with continental tholeiitic volcanism. The study suggests that the difference between continental and oceanic volcanism is triggered by the presence or absence of a moving continental lithosphere over the low-velocity layer and whether major rifts tap the low-velocity layer through the lithosphere. The authors propose a model for the evolution of mid-ocean ridges and spreading of the sea floor based on their findings.
