tldr: The author conducted experiments with various substances to study the effects of temperature and density on their molecular structure and spectral properties. They discovered that as the temperature increases, elemental matter breaks up into more complex forms, which can be observed through spectroscopy. This research provides evidence for the relationship between molecular complexity and the type of spectrum produced.
