tldr: John Goodricke observed the periodic variation of the brightness of the star Algol and discovered that it changes from the second to the fourth magnitude in about three and a half hours, and then back to the second magnitude in the same time. The whole cycle takes about seven hours, and the variation likely recurs every two days and twenty-one hours. Goodricke's findings were significant for understanding the behavior of variable stars and inspired further astronomical investigations.
