tldr: The thermal decomposition of methylene chloride was studied in the temperature range of 600-800Â°C using both static pressure-time measurement and a flow system with gas chromatographic analysis. The reaction, which mainly produces carbon and hydrogen chloride, is characterized by a slow acceleration with a decreasing rate as the vessel diameter increases. A delayed branching mechanism involving the production of dichlorethylene as an intermediate has been deduced, explaining the reaction's kinetic features and the formation of minor products.
