tldr: The author, Frederick Pollock, explores the properties of odd numbers and their division into four squares. He demonstrates that certain relations exist among the roots of these squares, which can be applied to even numbers as well. Pollock also shows that these properties can be connected to arithmetic series and suggests a possible link to Fermat's theorem on polygonal numbers.
