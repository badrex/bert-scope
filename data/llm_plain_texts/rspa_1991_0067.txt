tldr: The author presents an extensive analysis of the entropy of 22 nearly free electron metals, focusing on the pair correlation entropy and higher order correlation entropy. The study reveals a roughly universal behavior for most liquid metals, with anomalous cases related to anomalous electronic properties. The findings contribute to the understanding of ion motion in liquids and the development of condensed matter theory.
