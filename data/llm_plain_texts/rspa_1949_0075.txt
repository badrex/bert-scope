tldr: The authors introduce a new two-step method of optical imaging called wave-front reconstruction, which uses coherent monochromatic waves to create a diffraction pattern and then reconstructs the original object's wave-front using an optical synthetizer. This method can be applied to both two-dimensional and three-dimensional objects and has the potential to improve electron microscopy resolution.
