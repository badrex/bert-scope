tldr: The authors investigated the effects of organic growth-promoting substances (auximones) on soil organisms involved in the nitrogen cycle. They found that bacterised peat, which contains these auximones, increases the activity of nitrogen-fixing organisms in the soil, improving overall soil fertility. This discovery helps to understand the role of auximones in soil health and plant growth.
