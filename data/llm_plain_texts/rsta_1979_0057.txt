tldr: This article discusses the limitations and future prospects of ultrasonic and radiological methods in engineering and medical diagnosis. It focuses on the development of quantitative ultrasonics, which aims to provide size, shape, and orientation information of flaws in materials and structures. The authors present a summary of the highlights of their interdisciplinary program, including defect characterization techniques, scattering theories, and inversion processes to deduce flaw parameters from ultrasonic measurements.
