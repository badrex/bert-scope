tldr: The authors investigate the polarization of zinc electrodes in neutral and acid solutions of zinc salts using direct and alternating currents. They find that an increase in current density causes a slight increase in the effect, and the influence of frequency within the limits of 50-2,000 is negligible. The results show that an alternating current superimposed on a direct current can depolarize the electrode.
