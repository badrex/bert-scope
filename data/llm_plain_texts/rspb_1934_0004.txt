tldr: This study investigates the effect of reflex muscle contractions on blood flow in skeletal muscles, the diaphragm, and the small intestine. The results show that reflex contractions, like motor contractions, decrease arterial inflow during the contraction but increase the total blood flow during the intervals between contractions. The main difference between reflex and motor contractions is the rarity of arterial regurgitation and the slower development and recession of the contracted state in reflex tetanus. The study concludes that there is no fundamental difference between the changes in circulation in muscles contracting in response to motor nerve stimulation and those contracting reflexly.
