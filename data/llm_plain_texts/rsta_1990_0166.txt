tldr: The authors analyze the motion of a material interface between two fluids in a pressure field using a Lagrangian approach. They describe the interface as the image of the unit circle under a time-dependent conformal map and discuss the behavior of singularities in the interface. The study focuses on self-similar solutions and their stability, providing insights into the complex dynamics of fluid interfaces.
