tldr: The author, William Herschel, investigates the local arrangement of celestial bodies in space and the extent of the Milky Way. He examines the classification of stars based on their magnitudes and proposes a method to determine their relative distances. The study also explores the use of parallax to ascertain the distance of celestial objects and the possibility of calculating the real distance of stars based on their brightness.
