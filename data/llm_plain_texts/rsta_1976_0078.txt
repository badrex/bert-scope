tldr: The authors conducted experiments on oolitic limestones to study their deformation paths under controlled conditions. They found that many limestones have undergone deformation by a process of approximately plane strain. The study showed that increased pressure and temperature promote a change in the deformation mechanism from cataclasis to intracrystalline gliding. The results support the utilization of the deformation path concept in understanding natural strain states in rocks.
