tldr: This article discusses the importance of regional geochemical mapping for understanding environmental geochemistry in relation to health. It presents different approaches to compiling multi-element atlases, including extrapolation, multi-stage low-density sampling, and methodical wide-spaced sampling. The article emphasizes the need for cost-effective and efficient sampling, analysis, data processing, and map compilation to achieve the desired objectives in environmental geochemistry and health applications.
