tldr: The author investigates the relationship between emission and absorption bands in the mercury spectrum. They discover that the absorption bands are not identical to the emission bands, but both series exhibit a considerable measure of regularity. The study contributes to the understanding of atomic physics and the application of the quantum theory to band spectra.
