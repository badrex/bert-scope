tldr: The authors studied the interactions between helium metastable atoms and resonance photons with surfaces and gases. They measured the electron yield from a gold surface when exposed to helium metastable atoms and determined the cross-sections for various collisions involving these atoms. Additionally, they investigated the photoelectric yield from the gold surface and the attenuation of the photon flux when passing through noble gases.
