tldr: The study found that ectoparasites, such as fleas and lice, significantly reduce the long-term survival of cliff swallows. By manipulating ectoparasite load through fumigation, researchers discovered that non-fumigated birds had an annual survivorship about 12% less than fumigated birds. This suggests that ectoparasites impose a substantial long-term cost on their hosts and that all birds in the population are at risk of suffering from parasitism and the resulting reductions in survivorship.
