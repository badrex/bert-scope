tldr: The article discusses the challenges of applying existing life-history concepts to clonal organisms and proposes a model for a size-structured population of genets, each comprising an age-structured metapopulation of modules. The authors argue that the effects of r- and K-selection differ in clonal organisms compared to unitary organisms, and they explore the implications of different genet architectures on life-history theory.
