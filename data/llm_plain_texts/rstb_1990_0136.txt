tldr: This article discusses the use of Meteosat satellite imagery to track weather patterns and their potential impact on locust migration. The authors analyze a specific weather event in North Africa, which they believe may have transported locust swarms from Algeria to Mauritania. They also explore the potential of Meteosat data for monitoring weather conditions favorable for locust reproduction and gregarization.
