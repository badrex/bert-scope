tldr: The author extends the class of functions for which the smooth transition of a Stokes multiplier across a Stokes line can be rigorously established to functions satisfying a certain differential equation of arbitrary order. The universal error function smoothing for the Stokes multipliers is found to hold for this particular solution of the differential equation. The author also introduces a generalized terminant function to describe the change of a multiplier across a Stokes line.
