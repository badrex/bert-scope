tldr: This study shows that the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) influences both body odours and body odour preferences in humans. Women's preferences depend on their hormonal status, with women not taking oral contraceptives finding body odours more pleasant when they differ from the men in their MHC. This suggests that the MHC or linked genes influence human mate choice today.
