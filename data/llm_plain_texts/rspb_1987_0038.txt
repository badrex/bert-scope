tldr: This article explores the concept of the 'handicap principle' in sexual selection, which proposes that females prefer males with handicaps because they indicate high heritable viability. The authors analyze different types of handicaps, such as Zahavi's handicap, revealing handicap, and condition-dependent handicap, and discuss the conditions under which the 'handicap principle' can cause the exaggeration of male handicaps and female mating preferences. They conclude that the 'handicap principle' can have significant effects on the evolution of male secondary sexual characters under certain conditions.
