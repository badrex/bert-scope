tldr: In this paper, Sir Everard Home describes a nearly complete fossil skeleton of the Proteo-Saurus, with most parts in good preservation. He corrects and completes his previous accounts of the animal, and a drawing of the natural size accompanies the paper. The author states that the parts are clear and distinct, making any verbal description superfluous.
