tldr: The author presents a memoir on single and double theta-functions, which are defined as sums of series of exponentials. The number of single functions is four, while the number of double functions is sixteen. The author investigates the properties and relationships of these functions, establishing the product-theorem as a natural point of separation between the single and double function theories.
