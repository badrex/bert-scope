tldr: This study examines the development of sieve tubes in Acer pseudoplatanus, identifying five stages of differentiation. The research focuses on the role of endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi bodies, and organelle changes during the development of a cambial initial into a mature sieve element. The findings provide insights into the structure and function of plant tissues.
