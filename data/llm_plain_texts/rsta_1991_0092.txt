tldr: This article discusses the energy transport processes in solar flares, focusing on heat conduction and radiative transfer. The authors review the basic physics of these processes and their observational evidence. They also explore the role of radiative energy transport, which may be a significant mechanism for transferring energy into and through dense, optically thick chromospheric and photospheric layers.
