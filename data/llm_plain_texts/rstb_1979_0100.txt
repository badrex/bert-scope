tldr: The article discusses the concept of geochemical ecology and its relation to health problems. It explains how the state of health or disease is influenced by the nature of the organism, the properties of the biosphere, and the geochemical composition of the environment. The author suggests a system of biogeochemical regionalizing to study the ecological structure of the biosphere and the interaction of geochemical factors with organisms. This system helps in understanding the role of natural and technogenic environments in health preservation and disease prevention.
