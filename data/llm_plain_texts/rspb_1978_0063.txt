tldr: The authors study the ultrastructure and secretion of the periostracum in various terebratulide brachiopods. They discover three different types of periostracum and describe the secretory regimes of these species. The research provides insights into the development and composition of the periostracum, which is an essential part of brachiopod anatomy.
