tldr: The author discusses the adaptation of anaerobic organisms, particularly Escherichia coli, to life without oxygen. They explore the mechanisms that allow these organisms to switch between aerobic and anaerobic environments and the role of the citric acid cycle in this process. The author also highlights the challenges posed by oxygen toxicity and the importance of understanding these adaptations for biotechnology and medicine.
