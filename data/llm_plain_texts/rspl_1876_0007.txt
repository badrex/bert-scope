tldr: The author examines parasitic thallophytes found within recent madreporaria, studying their range, growth, and reproduction. They describe the long slender canals containing filamentous organisms and explain the method of entry of the growth and its relation to the organic basis of the coral sclerenchyma. The author also discusses the classification of the parasitic vegetable form, suggesting it belongs to a group with a complicated life cycle influenced by marine and subaerial conditions.
