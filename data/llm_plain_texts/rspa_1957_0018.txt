tldr: The authors investigate the structure and stability of inorganic azides, focusing on the relationship between crystal structure and explosive sensitivity. They determine the refractive indices of these compounds and discuss how the metal ion influences the azide group's decomposition. The study concludes that the explosive sensitivity of inorganic azides is dependent on the ionization potential of the metal forming the azide.
