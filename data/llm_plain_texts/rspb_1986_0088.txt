tldr: The article demonstrates the analogy between cooperativity in the binding of ligands to proteins and non-additivity in protein-protein interactions. It introduces the interaction constant, a measure of non-additivity, and shows its relation to the Wong measure of cooperativity. The study also derives the Hill coefficient for an asymmetric dimer that binds two different ligands and discusses its implications in the context of non-additivity in protein-protein interactions.
