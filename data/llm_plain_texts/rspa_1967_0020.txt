tldr: The author discusses the Moon's geometrical shape and internal stresses, proposing that the oblate shape of the Moon is due to thermal effects associated with the decrease of surface temperature from the equator towards the poles. This temperature difference causes an increase in the thickness of the outer solid layer, leading to isostatic equilibrium and an oblate shape. The disequilibrium figure of the Moon indicates the existence of internal stresses, which can be reconciled with the semimolten interior of the Moon.
