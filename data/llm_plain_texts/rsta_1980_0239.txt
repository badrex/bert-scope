tldr: The authors conducted a detailed geophysical survey of the westernmost Gulf of Aden to study the sea floor spreading history and evolution of young continental margins. They obtained 16 precision depth, gravity, and total intensity magnetic profiles and a continuous seismic reflection profile. The results suggest that the Gulf of Aden has likely evolved in at least three distinct phases and that its ocean-continent boundary is between the 100 fathom contour and the coast, making the continental margins oceanic margins. This study provides valuable insights into the early stages of continental drift, sea floor spreading, and the evolution of continental margins.
