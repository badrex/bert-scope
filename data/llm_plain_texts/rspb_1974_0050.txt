tldr: The authors conducted field studies on the ecology of the coelacanth, Latimeria chalumnae Smith, in Grande Comore. They found a low catch rate, suggesting a smaller fish population. The authors discuss the possible reasons for this, including the sea-bed configuration, tidal streams, and the possibility of fresh water seepage from nearby volcanic islands. The study suggests that Latimeria may be restricted to the steep slopes near the coasts of Grande Comore and Anjouan, which is a rare habitat today.
