tldr: This article investigates the impact of rotation on the lift and moment of a Joukowski aerofoil. The author finds that rotation increases the Joukowski circulation, changes the lift coefficient, creates a small drag, and alters the moment coefficient. These findings apply to any ordinary aerofoil section with sufficient accuracy, making them useful for practical aerodynamics.
