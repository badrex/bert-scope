tldr: The author, William Julian Evans, discusses the structure and function of the spleen in humans and animals. He describes the spleen's cells as being formed of a lining membrane and fibro-elastic tissue, which help in blood circulation. The spleen also plays a role in the lymphatic system and can contribute to congestion in the veins if an obstructing cause arises. This paper includes illustrations and diagrams to support the author's findings.
