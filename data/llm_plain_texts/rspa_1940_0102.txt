tldr: The authors describe experimental methods for investigating the vibration spectra of certain condensed gases at the temperature of liquid nitrogen, focusing on infra-red and Raman spectra. They developed a spectrometer that can be used for both high and low temperatures, and discuss the design and operation of the instrument, as well as the absorption cell. This research aimed to study the change in the spectrum with a change of state and at a transition point, providing evidence for or against the hypothesis of rotation in the solid state.
