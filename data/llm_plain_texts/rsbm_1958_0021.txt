tldr: 'The biography of Carl Stormer, a Norwegian mathematician who made significant contributions to pure mathematics and aurora research. Stormer was a student of mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry, meteorology, and geology. He published numerous papers on pure mathematics and number theory. His research on the motion of charged particles in magnetic fields led him to study the aurora, which became his main focus. Stormer's work on electron trajectories in the geomagnetic field and his calculations of periodic orbits have had a lasting impact on the field.'
