tldr: The study investigates the responses of the H1 neuron in fruit flies to different contrasts and moving bars. The results show that the directional motion-sensitive system saturates at low contrast levels, suggesting it is adapted to detecting small contrasts rather than measuring them over the whole range. The response is not related to the square of the contrast, indicating that multiplication of stimulus intensity at neighboring receptors is not a significant component of the motion processing mechanism. The findings are interpreted in terms of spatiotemporal fields of unit motion-detecting neurons.
