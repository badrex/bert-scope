tldr: The article discusses the three-dimensional structure of unliganded GroEL, a molecular chaperone involved in protein folding. The structure provides insights into the function of GroEL and its role in preventing the formation of off-pathway folding intermediates. The study also highlights the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying chaperonin function for further research and potential applications in protein folding and disease treatment.
