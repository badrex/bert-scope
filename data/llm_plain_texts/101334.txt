tldr: In 1673, Italian astronomer Giovanni Domenico Cassini discovered two new planets orbiting Saturn while working at the Royal Parisian Observatory. These new planets were visible through a telescope and had distinct orbits from Saturn's other known moons. Cassini's observations helped improve our understanding of the solar system and the behavior of celestial bodies.
