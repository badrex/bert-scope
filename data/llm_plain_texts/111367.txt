tldr: The author examines the reproductive organs of various annelid species and their anatomical variations. They establish that a specific organ, the segmental organ, is present in different forms throughout the Annelida, Echinodermata, Rotifera, and Actiniadae families. This organ serves various functions, such as acting as a discharge tube or developing into reproductive structures. The author also discusses the absence of a blood-vascular system in some annelid families and the lack of a general cavity used as an incubatory chamber.
