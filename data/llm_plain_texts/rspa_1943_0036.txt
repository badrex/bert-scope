tldr: The authors studied the infra-red absorption spectra of various hydrocarbon-type polymers and their associated monomers. They discovered the existence of methyl groups in polythene and found that the spectra of these polymers are simplified due to recurring units and specific vibration frequencies. This research can help in understanding the internal molecular structure of polymers and their physical properties.
