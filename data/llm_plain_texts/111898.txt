tldr: The author, Thomas Graham, discusses the concept of liquid diffusion and its applications in separating and analyzing different substances. He distinguishes between two classes of substances: crystalloids, which are highly diffusive and tend to crystallize, and colloids, which have low diffusibility, are typically found in animal and plant tissues, and form a gelatinous structure. Graham also explains the use of dialysis, a technique that uses a semipermeable membrane to separate colloids and crystalloids, and its applications in purifying various substances.
