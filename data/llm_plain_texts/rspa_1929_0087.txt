tldr: The authors describe the design and use of a double camera system for photographing artificial disintegrations, focusing on improving the accuracy and number of tracks captured on a single photograph. They discuss two camera arrangements and the importance of lens focal length, aperture, and magnification in achieving the best results for studying disintegration collisions.
