tldr: The authors studied the effect of various metallic oxides and hydrates on the dielectric constants of ice at low temperatures. They found that the presence of certain oxides or hydrates significantly increased the dielectric power of ice. The dielectric constants of ice with suspended or dissolved metallic oxides and hydrates were measured, and the results showed that the dielectric constants of all samples were reduced to a value close to that of pure ice at even lower temperatures. The authors also observed that the solvent or menstruum had a significant impact on the dielectric constant.
