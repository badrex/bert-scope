tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the electrical emissivity and disintegration of hot metals, focusing on platinum and other platinum metals. They found that the presence of oxygen is essential for the disintegration of most metals, and that the volatility of metals at temperatures below their melting points is a common phenomenon. The experiments were conducted using nitrogen gas, which is chemically inert to most metals, and the temperatures were measured using an optical pyrometer.
