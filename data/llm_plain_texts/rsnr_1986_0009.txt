tldr: Humphrey Jackson was an influential chemist in the 18th century who made significant contributions to the field of medicine and chemistry. He developed a method for making isinglass from British materials and invented a way to preserve naval timber from decay. Jackson also conducted experiments on tar-water and worked on refining it for medicinal purposes. He was involved in a court case related to Dr. Robert James's fever powder and later patented a medicinal compound called 'Cordial Bitter Tincture for the Stomach.' Additionally, Jackson authored a book on the chemical detection of food adulteration, making him a pioneer in this field.
