tldr: The study investigates the role of lymphocytes in antibody formation and the transfer of immunological memory to tetanus toxoid. The research shows that small lymphocytes develop into plasma cells and that long-lived lymphocytes carry immunological memory. The findings also suggest that macrophages are not essential for the induction of the secondary response.
