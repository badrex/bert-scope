tldr: The author, William Derham, conducted experiments to measure the height of mercury in barometers at different heights, specifically on a monument. He found that for every 82 feet of height, the mercury descends about 1/10 of an inch. Derham also provided a detailed description of a portable barometer design that could be useful for such experiments.
