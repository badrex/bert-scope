tldr: This article presents a general thermodynamical theory for rods, considering the motion of a rod as a curve with two assigned directors at each point. The authors develop equations of motion and energy balance, incorporating constitutive equations for force and director forces. They also discuss the special case of an elastic rod and its constitutive assumptions.
