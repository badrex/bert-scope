tldr: This paper investigates the formation and motion of singularities in the classical Rayleigh-Taylor flow, a basic problem in fluid dynamics. The author explores the dynamics of singularities in the unphysical complex plane and shows that a one-half singularity approaching the physical domain corresponds to a continually developing spike at the interface. The study provides insights into the interaction of multiple singularities and the relation between long-term bubble dynamics and initial conditions.
