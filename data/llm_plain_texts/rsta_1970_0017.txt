tldr: The authors studied the short-range order and properties of pseudosymmetric and mixed crystals of small organic molecules, specifically -oxyphenazine and phenazine. They observed disorder diffuse scattering and short-range order domains in -oxyphenazine crystals and found that phenazine can form a solid solution with -oxyphenazine up to a certain mole percentage without disrupting these domains. The authors also suggested that two components, one ordered and the other with short-range order, cannot form a continuous mixed-crystal series.
