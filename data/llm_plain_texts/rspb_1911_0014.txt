tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine if antelopes could act as reservoirs for the virus of sleeping sickness (Trypanosoma gambiense). They found that antelopes could be infected by the bites of laboratory-bred and infected Glossina palpalis flies, but they were not naturally infected. The study's results suggest that controlling the movements of antelopes could help in controlling the spread of sleeping sickness.
