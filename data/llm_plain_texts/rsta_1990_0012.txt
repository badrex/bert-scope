tldr: This article reviews the current understanding of the mechanisms in metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) for growing semiconductor materials like GaAs. The authors discuss the decomposition of trimethylgallium and triethylgallium precursors, the role of arsine, and the potential use of phenylarsine as an alternative precursor. They also highlight the challenges in understanding gas-phase and surface reactions in MOCVD and the need for further comprehensive studies.
