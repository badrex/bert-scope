tldr: Professor Euler examines the motion of the moon and supports Sir Isaac Newton's theory. Euler's research, along with the work of Mr. Clairaut, confirms that Newton's theory is sufficient to explain the moon's motion. This discovery brings new recognition to Newton's theory and allows for the creation of accurate astronomical tables for the moon.
