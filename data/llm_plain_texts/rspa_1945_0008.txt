tldr: The authors analyze the normal vibrations of bridged molecules, specifically diborane and dimeric halides, using a valency-force treatment. They provide a molecular model for these molecules and calculate their vibration frequencies, which are in agreement with experimental data. This study supports the bridge configuration for these molecules and provides insights into their bond strengths and force constants.
