tldr: This article investigates the residual lattice strains in plastically deformed polycrystalline metal aggregates using X-ray diffraction methods. The authors show that the residual lattice strains vary in both magnitude and sign, and they explain this phenomenon by considering the role of dislocations and grain orientations in the metal. The study provides insights into the internal stresses and strains in deformed metal aggregates, which is essential for understanding their mechanical properties and potential applications.
