tldr: The authors present a general theory for unsteady two-dimensional flows with free boundaries, expanding on the initial development of steady two-dimensional flows. They transform the problem into the hodograph plane and apply the unsteady form of Bernoulli's equation to derive boundary conditions. The method is then applied to specific problems, such as jet flow through a slit and flow around obstacles.
