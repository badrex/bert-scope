tldr: The author, Isaac Milner, conducted experiments to study the production of nitrous acid and nitrous air. He discovered that nitrous acid can be converted into phlogisticated air by passing it through a red-hot iron tube. This process also produces volatile alkali, which can be used to create nitrous acid or nitrous air by decomposing the alkali. The experiments provide insights into the chemical reactions and gas production involved in these processes.
