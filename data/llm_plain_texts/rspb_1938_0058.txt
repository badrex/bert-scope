tldr: The authors describe the isolation and comparison of two copper-protein compounds, haemocuprein and hepatocuprein, found in the blood and liver of mammals. They present a purification method for these compounds and discuss their properties, including their crystalline structures and molecular weights. This research contributes to understanding the presence and role of copper in animal tissues.
