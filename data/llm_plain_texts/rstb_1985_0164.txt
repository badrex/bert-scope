tldr: This article discusses the role of antioxidants in protecting cells from oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. It highlights the importance of vitamin E as a lipid-soluble, chain-breaking antioxidant that works synergistically with water-soluble reducing agents like ascorbic acid. The article also explains the mechanisms of different antioxidants, including enzymes like catalase and glutathione peroxidase, and how they protect cells and biomembranes from damage.
