tldr: This article investigates the unstable oscillation of tubular cantilevers conveying fluid. The authors establish the conditions of stability for a system constrained to move in a horizontal plane, neglecting internal friction in the tube material and the surrounding fluid. They construct a universal stability curve and calculate the complex frequency of the system's lowest modes to demonstrate the transition from stability to instability as the flow velocity increases.
