tldr: Dr. Ebenezer Latham proposed an improvement in the construction of celestial globes to better serve the purposes of chronology and history. By making the poles of the globes move in a circle around the poles of the ecliptic, the globes would provide a view of the heavens suited for any period, allowing for better understanding of ancient descriptions and controversies.
