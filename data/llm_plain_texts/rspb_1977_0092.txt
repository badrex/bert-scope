tldr: The study investigates the regulation of thymidine phosphorylation in Acetabularia, a type of sea squirt, focusing on the role of nucleo-cytoplasmic interactions and the involvement of de novo synthesis of enzyme proteins. The research shows that enzyme activity increases even in the absence of the cell nucleus, indicating that regulation is not mediated through an activator protein but rather through the synthesis of the enzyme protein.
