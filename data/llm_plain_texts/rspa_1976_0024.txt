tldr: This article investigates the vibration-rotation coupling in carbon dioxide-hydrogen mixtures using laser schlieren measurements of vibrational relaxation. The authors found that the coupling rates between the bending mode of carbon dioxide and hydrogen agree well with calculations based on Sharma's model. However, they observed unusually fast relaxation rates in carbon dioxide-hydrogen deuteride mixtures, suggesting the importance of the rotational relaxation rate of the hydrogen isomer. The authors propose that the first-order model of Sharma underestimates the coupling rate by a factor of 2, but this discrepancy is not considered significant.
