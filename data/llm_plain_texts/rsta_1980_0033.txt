tldr: The article discusses the use of satellite Doppler tracking for geodetic applications in Canada. The Geodetic Survey of Canada established a geodetic control network using the satellite-Doppler method, which contributed to the readjustment of the Canadian triangulation network and provided information on polar motion and long-term variations of the satellite system. The technique has various applications, including orthometric height determination and ice monitoring in the Canadian Arctic.
