tldr: This paper focuses on the evaluation and tabulation of integrals of the form involving products of Bessel functions. The authors derive a formula for these integrals in terms of an integral of a hypergeometric function and provide approximate expansions for specific cases. The integrals are used in various problems in mathematical physics, such as potential in cylindrical coordinates, vector potential, stream function, and stress components in solids and plates.
