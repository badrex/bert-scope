tldr: 'This study examines the use of pelvic crurae as walking limbs in skates and rays. The authors found that these creatures use their crurae for bipedal locomotion on the bottom at speeds around one-third of a disc length per second. This "walking" pattern is likely employed to feed on prey within the substrate, as sting rays, which feed differently, do not possess such crurae. The characteristic tracks left by rays walking on soft mud may be recognizable in the fossil record.'
