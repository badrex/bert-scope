tldr: This article presents a study on the lattice statics and dynamics of the NaF crystal using the deformable shell model. The authors calculate various properties, such as cohesive energy, phase transition pressure, and phonon dispersion relations, and compare their results with experimental data. The deformable shell model effectively includes many-body interactions and can be applied to both static and dynamic properties of alkali halide crystals.
