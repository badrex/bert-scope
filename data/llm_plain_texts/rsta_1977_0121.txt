tldr: The article explores the use of experimental data on clinopyroxene and garnet solid solutions to estimate the pressure and temperature of crystallization of rocks. By determining the activities of components and their relations to mineral compositions, the authors apply this knowledge to the granulites of South Harris, providing accurate pressure estimates within a range of kbar and temperature uncertainties related to pressure uncertainties.
