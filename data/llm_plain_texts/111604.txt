tldr: John Tyndall conducted experiments to study the transmission of radiant heat through various gaseous bodies. He used a tube with rock-salt plates to allow calorific rays to pass through and compared the effects of different gases on heat absorption. The results showed that gases have varying abilities to intercept radiant heat, and different gases can affect different qualities of radiant heat differently. This investigation provides valuable insights into the understanding of heat transfer and gas properties.
