tldr: The author, George Salmon, attempts to enumerate the invariants, covariants, and contravariants of a quaternary cubic, which represents a surface of the third order. The study involves working with Mr. Sylvester's canonical form and calculating the Hessian of a cubic. The author also explores the reciprocant and discriminant of the given quadric and derives several concomitant functions.
