tldr: The authors present a numerical approach to solve the line contact problem of elastohydrodynamic lubrication, focusing on the transition and exit layers. They use a Fourier series representation and trigonometric expressions to find the film thickness in these layers, achieving high accuracy in their calculations. The solutions are universal and definitive for their respective parameter regimes, providing valuable insights into the behavior of lubrication systems.
