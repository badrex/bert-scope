tldr: The author examines the organization of fossil plants found in coal measures, specifically focusing on Lepidodendroid branches. They argue against the views of M. Renault and provide evidence that the central axis of these plants increases in size and complexity as the plant grows and ages. The author also discusses the development of the exogenous zone and the prosenchymatous zone in these plants.
