tldr: This article presents a functional form of field equations in quantum field theory, focusing on neutral scalar meson theory without nucleon recoil. The authors develop a method to relate the Green function of a nucleon in an external field with radiative corrections to that of a nucleon in an arbitrary external field without radiative corrections. They provide a closed-form solution for the Green function and discuss its singularities, which are expected to exhibit similar behavior in more realistic cases.
