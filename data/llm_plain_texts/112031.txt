tldr: The author conducted experiments on the behavior of gun-cotton and gunpowder when exposed to high temperatures and rarefied atmospheres. They discovered that the combustion of gun-cotton can be altered depending on the atmospheric pressure and conditions, with slower and different forms of combustion occurring in highly rarefied atmospheres. This research has implications for understanding the rate of combustion of fuses and explosives under different atmospheric pressures.
