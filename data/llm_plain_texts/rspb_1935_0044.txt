tldr: The authors conducted experiments on blowfly larvae and discovered that a hormone is responsible for inducing pupation. They found that the anterior part of the larva contains the necessary stimulus for the posterior part to pupate. The presence of a ganglionic mass in the anterior part is crucial for this process, and the hormone is likely responsible for initiating pupation in the posterior part. This research sheds light on the hormonal control of insect metamorphosis.
