tldr: This article presents experiments conducted to determine the laws governing the strength of cylindrical vessels exposed to external force, with a focus on boiler flues. The author found that the length and thickness of tubes significantly affect their resistance to collapse, leading to the development of more accurate methods for proportioning boiler flues and preventing dangerous accidents caused by boiler explosions.
