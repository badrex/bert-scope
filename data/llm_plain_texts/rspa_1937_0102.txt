tldr: This article investigates the influence of pressure on the spontaneous ignition of inflammable gas-air mixtures, specifically the simpler olefines like ethylene, propylene, butylene, and amylene. The authors found that the ignition points of these mixtures decrease with increasing pressure. They also observed cool flames in some mixtures, particularly propylene-air mixtures, and discussed the implications of their findings for the problem of "knock" in combustion engines.
