tldr: This study investigates the visual processes underlying the perception of biological motion, specifically how the movements of individual dots in a display are encoded and integrated to form a representation of a walking figure. The research suggests that the effect relies upon responses in low-level motion-detecting processes and does not involve hierarchical visual analysis of motion components. The findings challenge current theoretical treatments of biological motion perception.
