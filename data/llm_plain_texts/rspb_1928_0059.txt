tldr: The author's study on faradic stimulation of the cerebellar nuclei reveals that the cerebellum influences postural tone by increasing the tone of flexor muscles and inhibiting the tone of extensor muscles. This dual nature of cerebellar control supports the idea that the cerebellum plays a crucial role in coordinating muscle movements and maintaining balance. The findings challenge previous beliefs about cerebellar function and provide a better understanding of how the cerebellum controls muscle tone and postural stability.
