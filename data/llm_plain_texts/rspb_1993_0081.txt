tldr: The study investigates the response of the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) leaves to spatial and temporal gradients of atmospheric CO2 concentration. The researchers analyzed the carbon isotope composition of leaves from an altitudinal gradient in Austria, herbarium leaves from 1819-1985, and Quaternary fossil leaves from a glacial cycle. The results suggest that the leaves reflect the palaeotemperature under which they formed and can provide evidence for atmospheric change and palaeotemperatures, which may help determine the comparative timing of these events.
