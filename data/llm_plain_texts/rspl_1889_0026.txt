tldr: The authors studied the variations in the shells of Cardium edule found in different environmental conditions, such as varying water compositions and lake levels, in Western Central Asia. They observed changes in shell thickness, size, color, and shape, which they attributed to the diverse environmental conditions. These findings contribute to the understanding of how animals adapt to their surroundings.
