tldr: The author presents a method of photographing spark spectra of elements with solutions of their compounds to improve chemical analysis. They discuss the best materials for electrodes, such as gold, and describe the alterations in spectra caused by different electrode moistening methods. The author also shares their findings on the presence of impurities in certain spectra and the persistence of certain spectral lines.
