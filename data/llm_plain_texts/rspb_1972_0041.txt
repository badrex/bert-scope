tldr: 'This study examines the effects of polyploidy on meiotic duration and pollen development in cereal anthers. The research found that meiotic duration decreases as the ploidy level increases, and within each ploidy level, genotypes with higher nuclear DNA content have longer meiotic durations. The findings suggest that polyploid cereal species have faster rates of development during meiosis and pollen maturation, with constant proportions between the durations of all their constituent stages.'
