tldr: The study investigates the assembly process of the synaptinemal complex in the ascomycete Neottiella. The research reveals that the central regions of the synaptinemal complex are pre-assembled in the nucleolus and then converted into an amorphous transport form, which moves through the nucleoplasm to sites between the lateral components of synapsing homologous chromosomes. The findings contribute to understanding mechanisms of chromosome pairing and chiasma formation in meiosis.
