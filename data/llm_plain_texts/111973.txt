tldr: This article explores the absorption and radiation of heat by various gases and vapors. The author, John Tyndall, examines the effects of chemical combination on the absorption and radiation of heat, finding that compound gases have a higher absorptive power than elementary gases. The author also investigates dynamic heating and chilling, as well as the potential for determining the temperature of space through direct experimentation.
