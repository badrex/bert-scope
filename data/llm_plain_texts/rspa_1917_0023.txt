tldr: This article explores the dissipation of energy in tides and its connection with the acceleration of the moon's mean motion. The authors develop an expression for the rate of dissipation of kinetic energy in a sea and use it to find an approximate value for the rate of dissipation in the Irish Sea. They conclude that this direct effect of viscosity may account for at least an appreciable part of the Earth's secular retardation. The study also estimates the mean rate of dissipation of energy by viscosity per unit surface area and applies it to the portion of the Irish Sea called the Main Fairway.
