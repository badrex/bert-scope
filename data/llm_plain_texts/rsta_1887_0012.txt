tldr: This article examines the anomalies in the winds of Northern India and their relation to barometric pressure. The author discusses the extension of meteorological observations across India, leading to the collection of accurate and reliable barometric data. The study focuses on the characteristic winds of the hot season, which sometimes blow in opposition to the pressure gradient. The author also explores the excessive dryness in the afternoons and the diminishing velocity of winds as they approach the Bay of Bengal.
