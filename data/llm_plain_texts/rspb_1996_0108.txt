tldr: The study examines the impact of breeding lifespan and nest predation on the lifetime production of fledglings in male merlins. It found that these two factors account for 68.1% and 25.4% of the variance in lifetime reproductive success, respectively. Males with longer breeding lifespans produced more fledglings due to an increased number of successful breedings. Nest predation frequency was higher before hatching and among pairs that started laying late. The results suggest that nest defense by parents improves annual offspring production in merlins.
