tldr: The article explores the interactions of electrogenic sodium-calcium exchange, calcium channels, and the sarcoplasmic reticulum in the mammalian heart through simulations of extracellular calcium transients in rabbit atrium. The model predicts small trans-sarcolemmal calcium movements during regular stimulation and larger movements during non-steady-state stimulation. The simulations provide integrated explanations of electrical activity, contractile function, and trans-sarcolemmal calcium movements, which were beyond the scope of previous models.
