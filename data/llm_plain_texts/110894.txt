tldr: William Sturgeon's experiments showed that even minor mechanical agitation, such as blows with a wooden mallet or vibrations, can significantly reduce the magnetic power of steel magnets. This loss is permanent and reaches a maximum point, indicating that magnets possess a specific retentive force that cannot be further diminished by additional mechanical commotion.
