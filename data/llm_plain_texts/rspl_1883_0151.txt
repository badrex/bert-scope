tldr: The author investigates the production of transient electric currents in iron and steel conductors when they are twisted while magnetized or when magnetized while twisted. These currents present interesting features and can be explained by reference to the effects of stress on magnetism. The study provides a useful supplement to direct investigations of magnetic susceptibility and residual magnetism.
