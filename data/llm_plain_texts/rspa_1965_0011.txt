tldr: The authors conducted an optical study of flame failure in tubes at the fuel-lean limit of flammability. They discovered that a bubble of hot exhaust gas rises in contact with upward-propagating flames and continues to rise even after the visible flame has failed. This mechanism helps explain the difference between flammability limits for upward and downward flame propagation. The authors suggest that this mechanism itself causes flammability limits as conventionally defined and shows how limits for different fuels are related.
