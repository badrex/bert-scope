tldr: The 1971 Royal Society - Percy Sladen Expedition to the New Hebrides discovered a great deal of new knowledge about the islands' flora and fauna. The expedition covered only a portion of the archipelago, but some conclusions could be drawn from the known biota. The New Hebrides have a generally low level of endemism, with many species having wide environmental ranges. The expedition found that the climate, environmental factors, and distribution of species varied across the islands, leading to diverse ecosystems. Aneityum, the southernmost island, had a remarkably diverse flora compared to other islands in the New Hebrides.
