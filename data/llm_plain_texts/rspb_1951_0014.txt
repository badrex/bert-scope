tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand how antibodies accumulate in the stomach contents of foetal rabbits. They discovered that antibodies in the stomach contents come from the amniotic fluid and not the foetal circulation. This finding helps to clarify the process of antibody transfer in foetal rabbits and the role of amniotic fluid in their development.
