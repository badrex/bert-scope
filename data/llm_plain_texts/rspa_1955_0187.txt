tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effectiveness of pneumatic and similar breakwaters in calming waves. They discovered that surface currents set up by air injection and water jets have similar wave-damping effects, and the bubbles themselves have a minimal impact on wave motion. This research could be valuable for civil engineers in designing effective wave barriers.
