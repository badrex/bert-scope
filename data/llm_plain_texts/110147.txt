tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the mutual action of particles in magnetic bodies and the law of variation of magnetic forces during rotation. They discovered that the greatest development of magnetism in a disc occurs when the axes of the magnets are vertically under points bisecting the radii, and that magnetism decreases rapidly as they approach the edge. The author also found that the law of variation of magnetic force depends on the distance between the revolving magnets and the suspended body, and that this relationship can be represented as inversely proportional to the fourth power of their distance.
