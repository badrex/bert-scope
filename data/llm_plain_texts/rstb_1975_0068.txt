tldr: This article discusses the recognition of metal cations by biological systems, comparing it to geochemical criteria for isomorphous replacement. It explores the differences in uptake and storage of major nutrients and trace elements, as well as the importance of flexibility in selectivity. The article also highlights the role of metal-ligand stability constants in transfer and carrier properties, and the potential for foreign metals to cause poisoning by binding irreversibly to recognition sites.
