tldr: The Great Melbourne Telescope was a powerful reflecting telescope constructed in the 19th century for observing the nebulae of the Southern Hemisphere. The telescope used a 4-foot reflector and an equatorial mount, and it was designed to be more cost-effective and easier to construct than an achromatic telescope. The Great Melbourne Telescope contributed to advancements in celestial photography and provided valuable insights into the study of nebulae.
