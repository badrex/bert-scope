tldr: The authors conducted magnetic cooling experiments on a spherical single crystal of cobalt ammonium sulfate at temperatures below 1Â°C. They found that the susceptibility reached a sharp maximum in a field of a few hundred gauss, which marked the boundary of the antiferromagnetic region. The experimental results were discussed in connection with Saver and Temporley's model for antiferromagnetic states at low temperatures. The study provided insights into the ordering process and the appearance of the ordered phase in the crystal.
