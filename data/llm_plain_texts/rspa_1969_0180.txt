tldr: The authors examine the field equations in the neighborhood of a particle in a conformal theory of gravitation, focusing on a spherically symmetric metric. They explore different conformal frames and find a solution suitable for considering regions near the particle, which has distinct properties compared to previous solutions. The study also demonstrates that distant matter can affect local geometry in this theory.
