tldr: This article examines the British earthquakes of 1889, analyzing their epicenters, areas of disturbance, and possible causes. The author suggests that these earthquakes were likely caused by slips in specific faults, such as the Irwell fault and the N.W. and S.E. faults of the Pentlands. The study also discusses the differences between British and Swiss earthquakes and their implications for understanding the process of mountain evolution.
