tldr: The authors studied the combining properties of serum-complements and their interactions with anti-complements and immune bodies. They found that the combination of complement and red corpuscles with immune bodies is stable, while the combination of complement and anti-complement is less stable. The authors also discovered complementoids, which play a role in the immune response and hemolysis.
