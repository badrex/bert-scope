tldr: This article presents an analysis of the magnetic sealing effect in ferrofluid lubrication for a novel journal bearing configuration. The magnetic field in the bearing clearance and the sealing capability of the bearing are determined, providing a theoretical understanding of the performance of ferrofluid bearings and seals under various operating conditions. The study focuses on the side flow characteristics and reveals the magnetic sealing capability of the bearing, which can eliminate the need for mechanical seals and reduce bearing friction and weight.
