tldr: This article discusses the fossil record of bivalve molluscs and the challenges in understanding their phylogeny. The authors argue for a more flexible approach to evolutionary systematics that incorporates stratigraphic and palaeobiogeographic data. They highlight the diverse nature of the bivalve fossil record, the importance of population fragmentation in speciation, and the need to consider the limitations of the fossil record when reconstructing phylogenetic relationships.
