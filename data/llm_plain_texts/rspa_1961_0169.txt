tldr: This article investigates the transient kinetics of anodic oxide film formation on tantalum in dilute sulphuric acid. The authors study the ionic current through the oxide and its relationship with the concentration of mobile ions, the electric field, and the temperature. They find that the transient Tafel slope decreases with decreasing electric field and provide insights into the mechanisms of anodic oxidation and the formation of anodic oxide films.
