tldr: The authors studied the flash photolysis of chlorine dioxide and the reactions of halogen oxides. They observed the production and decay of the CIO radical and vibrationally excited oxygen. A proposed mechanism and rate constants are presented for the reactions, which help resolve existing conflicts in the field.
