tldr: This study investigates the angular distributions of charged particles produced by nuclear collisions involving 8 MeV deuterons. The research focuses on the bombardment of nitrogen and argon, measuring the angular distributions of elastically scattered deuterons, alpha particles, and protons from various nuclear reactions. The findings provide information about the spins and parities of the energy states of the nuclei produced in these reactions, which can be used to better understand nuclear processes and improve the accuracy of particle accelerator experiments.
