tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of sodium vapour treatment on glass surfaces. They discovered that the intense amber coloration and crack patterns on the glass surface are due to a chemical change in the surface during the treatment. The crack patterns form during cooling as a result of thermal contraction of a surface film with high sodium concentration. This research helps in understanding the strength-impairing surface flaws in glass.
