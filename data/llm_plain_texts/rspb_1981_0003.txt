tldr: The authors develop a method to predict the stochastic behavior of single ion channels, which is essential for understanding and interpreting experiments involving single-channel currents. They derive distributions for the length of sojourns in specific states and the number of openings during a single occupancy. The methods are applied to two simple theories of agonist action, providing insights into the dependence of ion channel behavior on ligand concentrations and membrane potential.
