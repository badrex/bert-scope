tldr: This study investigates the response of laminar boundary layers to oscillatory flows, with a focus on the effects of frequency, amplitude, and traveling wave convection velocity. The authors develop a theoretical analysis and conduct experiments using a wind tunnel to measure velocity profiles. The results show that the mean flow characteristics are similar to steady flow, supporting the assumption of linearity in oscillating perturbations. The boundary layer response is mainly influenced by the traveling wave convection velocity and frequency.
