tldr: This study investigates the failure modes of ceramics in rolling contact under cyclic loading conditions. The experiments reveal that the prevailing mode of failure is delamination, which can be classified based on the location of crack initiation and propagation. The findings suggest that ceramics, such as silicon nitride, can be considered for engineering applications like rolling contact bearings for gas turbines, as long as they fail by a non-catastrophic mode.
