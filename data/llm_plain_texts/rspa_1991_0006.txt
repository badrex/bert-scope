revised_title: 'Characterizing Plane Strain in Continuum Mechanics'
semantic_tags:
  - Continuum Mechanics
  - Plane Strain
  - Deformation
  - Invertibility
  - Weak Regularity
tldr: This article presents a new characterization of plane strain that holds even under weak regularity hypotheses on the deformation. The authors provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a deformation to be considered a plane strain, with implications for the study of macroscopic deformations in materials science.
