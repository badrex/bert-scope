tldr: This article discusses the complex and difficult study of radiative balance in the atmosphere. It explains the processes of emission, absorption, and transport of energy within the atmosphere and summarizes the current understanding of the radiative balance at the surface, in the atmosphere, and to space. The article also highlights the importance of direct measurements of atmospheric properties at high altitudes using rocket-transported instruments and the need for further research in this area.
