tldr: The author, Thomas Andrews, conducted experiments to study the critical points of gases and liquids, focusing on carbonic acid. He discovered that there is a specific point at which the distinction between the gaseous and liquid states of matter disappears, leading to a new understanding of phase transitions and the behavior of gases under pressure and temperature.
