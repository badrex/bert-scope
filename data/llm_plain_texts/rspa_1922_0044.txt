tldr: The author analyzed gases from residues of liquid air evaporation and gases stored in a vessel with radium chloride. They discovered that the atmosphere contains small amounts of two heavier constituents, likely molecules of krypton and xenon. The lighter constituent is more abundant, but both are only a small fraction of the amount of xenon. The author also observed a line indicating a substance with an atomic weight of about 118, possibly a compound of krypton.
