tldr: This article discusses the lines of circular polarization in electromagnetic wave fields, focusing on the singularities and properties of these lines. The author characterizes these lines in terms of their singularity index and explores their connection to two-dimensional tensor fields near isotropic points. The study of these lines and their properties can help in understanding the behavior of electromagnetic waves and their applications in various fields.
