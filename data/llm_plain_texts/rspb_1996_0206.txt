tldr: The authors explore the dynamics of extinction and diversification in ecosystems, suggesting that both levels are, to some extent, decoupled. They propose a new model of species interaction that includes extinction, diversification, and network dynamics, which helps explain the patterns observed in the fossil record and offers a new interpretation for the extinction process.
