tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine if phosphoric acid exists in igneous rocks. They found phosphoric acid in various types of rocks, including lava, trachyte, and basalt, suggesting that it is a common component of volcanic rocks. The presence of phosphoric acid in these rocks may contribute to the fertility of soils derived from their decomposition.
