tldr: The authors conducted experiments on six polydimethylsiloxane liquids with varying viscosity grades to study their viscoelastic relaxation behavior. They measured the shear mechanical impedance of these liquids over a frequency range of 10 kc/s to 78 Mc/s and at temperatures from -50 to +50 'C. The results were analyzed using the method of reduced variables, and the components of the shear modulus and dynamic viscosity were determined as a function of frequency. The authors found that the Rouse theory, as developed by Ferry and others, adequately describes the viscoelastic relaxation of low molecular weight siloxane liquids without entanglement coupling. For higher molecular weight siloxanes with entanglement, the theory was further developed to account for the properties of polydisperse polymers. Good agreement between experimental and theoretical results was obtained, allowing the prediction of the viscoelastic behavior of polydimethylsiloxane liquids based on molecular weight distribution and viscosity variation.
