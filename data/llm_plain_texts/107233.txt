tldr: The author investigates the process of bark formation in trees and the role of alburnum in generating new bark. They discovered that both the bark and alburnum can produce a fluid capable of generating a cellular substance, which forms the new bark. The author also found that the cellular substance in the bark and alburnum allows the true sap to pass through, playing a crucial role in the tree's growth and reproduction.
