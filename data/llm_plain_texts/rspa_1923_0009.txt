tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments to study the changes in charge of alpha-particles passing through matter. They discovered a new phenomenon, the middle band, which appeared between the deflected and undeflected bands of alpha-particles. The intensity and position of the middle band changed as the alpha-particles' emergent range decreased, providing insights into the behavior of alpha-particles and their interactions with matter.'
