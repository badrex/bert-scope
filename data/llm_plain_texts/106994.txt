tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand how the human eye adjusts to see near objects. They discovered that the adjustment is produced by three changes in the eye: an increase in the curvature of the cornea, an elongation of the axis of vision, and a motion of the crystalline lens. These changes depend mainly on the contraction of the four straight muscles of the eye.
