tldr: Emanuel Mendes da Costa describes the fossilized impressions of various plants found in coal strata, particularly in earthy slate layers. He discusses the discovery of rare and unknown plant species and recommends further study of these extraordinary impressions for their botanical significance. Da Costa also believes that these plant remains are evidence of the universal deluge recorded in the Bible.
