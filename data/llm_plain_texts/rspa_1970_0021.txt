revised_title: Gravitational Collapse Singularities and Cosmology
semantic_tags:
  - Gravitational Collapse
  - Space-time Singularities
  - Cosmology
  - General Relativity
  - Astrophysics
tldr: The authors present a new theorem on space-time singularities that strengthens the implication that a singularity-free bounce is not possible within the framework of general relativity. They discuss the implications of gravitational collapse and its connection to cosmology, and explore the nature of space-time singularities that may occur in the universe.
