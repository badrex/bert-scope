tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the flow of binary gas mixtures through a microporous carbon plug. They found that the less volatile components in the mixtures were transported on the surface of the adsorbent, leading to efficient separation processes. The blockage of gas-phase flow by the adsorbed phase was investigated, showing that the membrane can become impermeable to a non-sorbed component while remaining permeable to a strongly sorbed component. This study provides insights into the potential for using surface diffusion for gas separations.
