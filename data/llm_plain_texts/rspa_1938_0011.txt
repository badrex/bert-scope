tldr: The authors investigate the photolysis of silver bromide and the formation of the photographic latent image. They explain the process of light absorption by silver halides, the formation of an electron gas in the grain, and the interaction between electrons and metallic silver. The quantum efficiency of the formation of silver is discussed, as well as the role of temperature and electrolytic conductivity in the process. The authors propose a model for the formation of the latent image and its subsequent development.
