tldr: The authors analyze the effective boundary conditions for the scattering of two-dimensional SH waves from a curved thin elastic layer. They show that the appropriate boundary conditions include certain physical and geometrical effects to the first order in the layer thickness, and they test these conditions against the exact solution for a circular layer and compare them to the spring contact model.
