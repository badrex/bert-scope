tldr: 'This article explores the lesser-known career of Sir William Boyd Dawkins, a prominent geologist, as a consultant for the water, tunnelling, and mining industries. Dawkins's extensive archive, now housed in the John Rylands Library, reveals his significant contributions to engineering geology and his work on projects such as the Kent coalfield. The article highlights the importance of acknowledging the interplay between academia and industry in the history of geology and the potential for other geologists to have had similar hidden careers.'
