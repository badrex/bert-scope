tldr: This article discusses the true breaking stress of thermoplastics and the factors affecting their mechanical properties. The authors found that the discrepancy between theoretical and experimental breaking stresses is mainly due to high test temperatures and the lack of molecular orientation, rather than flaws. They also report on their work with highly drawn specimens, which showed that the discrepancy can be reduced by testing highly oriented specimens at low temperatures.
