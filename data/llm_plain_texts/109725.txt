tldr: This article explores how roots grow and adapt to their environment. The author, Thomas Andrew Knight, examines how roots grow in different types of soil and how they respond to factors like moisture and light. He explains that roots grow in the direction of the greatest food or moisture, and that they can adapt to their environment by changing their shape and strength. Knight also discusses the role of the alburnum in the growth and development of roots.
