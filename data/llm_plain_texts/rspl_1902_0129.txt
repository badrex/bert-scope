tldr: The author studied a small, unicellular green alga called Chlorella pyrenoidosa, which is commonly found in polluted water and has a preference for ammonia in its nutrition. The alga plays a role in the "purification" of sewage and its nitrogenous metabolism was investigated. The alga grows well in pure cultures and can be used to study its impact on the composition of polluted water.
