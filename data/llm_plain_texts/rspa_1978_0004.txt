tldr: This study investigates the effect of distant sidewalls on the transition to finite amplitude Benard convection. The research shows that when there is a small heat transfer through the sidewalls, the bifurcation is replaced by a smooth transition to finite amplitude convection, ensuring the motion's stability. The findings apply to more realistic models, expanding our understanding of fluid dynamics and heat transfer processes.
