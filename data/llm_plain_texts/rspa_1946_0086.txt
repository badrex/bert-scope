tldr: The authors propose a statistical approach to understand the phenomenon of fatigue in materials. They assume the existence of a statistical distribution function of the separation strength of cohesive bonds and explain the principal features of fatigue and its relations using this assumption. The study shows that the probability of rupture of individual bonds increases with the number of load cycles, and the probability of non-rupture also increases with the number of bonds remaining undamaged.
