tldr: This article discusses the importance of selenium in animal and human nutrition and health. Selenium is an essential trace element that plays a crucial role in the enzyme glutathione peroxidase, which helps control intracellular levels of hydrogen peroxide and protect cells from damage caused by oxygen metabolites. Selenium deficiency can lead to metabolic and physiological consequences, such as cardiomyopathy known as Keshan disease. The article highlights the interaction between selenium, other nutrients, and trace elements, emphasizing the importance of maintaining adequate selenium levels for overall health.
