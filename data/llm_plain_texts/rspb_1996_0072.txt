tldr: The study examines the genetic relationships between different life-cycle categories of the aphid Rhopalosiphum padi, including cyclic parthenogenesis and obligate parthenogenesis, by analyzing mitochondrial DNA, random amplified polymorphic DNA markers, and plasmid DNA markers of its bacterial endosymbiont, Buchnera aphidicola. The results reveal genetic divergence between clones with different breeding systems, suggesting an ancient origin of asexuality. A linked DNA marker is identified, which can be used to diagnose the breeding system and further study the gene(s) controlling the mode of reproduction in aphids.
