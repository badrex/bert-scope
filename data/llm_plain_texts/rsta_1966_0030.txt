tldr: This article discusses the deformation of solids caused by the impact of liquids and its relation to rain damage in aircraft and missiles, blade erosion in steam turbines, and cavitation erosion. The author explores the physics of liquid impact, the stresses produced, and the mechanisms of deformation, with a focus on practical applications and the interrelation of these processes.
