tldr: This study examines the microstructure and adaptation of the dentition and dermal ornament in three Devonian dipnoans from Western Australia. The research provides detailed descriptions of the histology and ultrastructure of the tissues and discusses their morphogenesis, growth, and adaptation to function. The findings contribute to understanding dipnoan interrelations and the evolution of their skeletal tissues.
