tldr: This article discusses the problem of nitrate leaching to groundwater from agricultural practices in Britain. The authors present the results of their research on four small groundwater catchments experiencing significant nitrate contamination. They analyze the distribution of nitrate in the unsaturated and saturated zones of the aquifers and discuss the implications for the water supply industry. The study highlights the importance of understanding the recent and long-term history of nitrate leaching from agricultural soils to protect groundwater quality and ensure safe drinking water.
