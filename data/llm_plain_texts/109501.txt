tldr: 'The author, William Morgan, investigates and solves seventeen problems related to contingent reversions involving three lives in survivorship. He also explores seven more problems, completing the subject. The study involves intricate calculations and laborious operations, but the author provides different demonstrations for each problem, ensuring the accuracy of the solutions. He concludes that cases involving four lives in survivorship are too complex and rare for practical application.'
