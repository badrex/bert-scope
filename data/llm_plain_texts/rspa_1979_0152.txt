tldr: The authors construct metric and vector potential perturbations of a Reissner-Nordström black hole using a recently described procedure for generating solutions to the linearized Einstein-Maxwell equations. They employ Chandrasekhar's recent decoupling of these equations and provide explicit formulae for the metric and vector potential perturbations for each parity type.
