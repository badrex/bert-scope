tldr: The study investigates the origin and development of the epidermis and associated structures in the cercaria of Cryptocotyle lingua, a parasitic flatworm. The researchers found that the epidermis is a syncytium with five types of secretion bodies connected to nucleated cell bodies in the parenchyma. These secretions may play a role in the cercaria's entry into and encystment within the second intermediate fish host.
