semantic_tags:
  - Geometry
  - Analytic Geometry
  - Projective Geometry
  - Coordinate Systems
  - Tangential Equations
tldr: The author introduces the concept of tangential coordinates as a new method of investigating and discussing the properties of space. This method allows for the determination of points, lines, and planes using a fixed and simple law. The author demonstrates the application of tangential coordinates in solving complex problems and improving mathematical understanding.
