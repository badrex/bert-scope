tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments to study the action of organic substances on ultra-violet rays of the spectrum. They used a combination of photographic plates and spectroscopy to observe the absorption of invisible rays by various organic substances. Their findings showed that the molecular constitution of a substance affects its actinic absorption, and that the photographic transparency of a substance can be a delicate test of its purity.'
