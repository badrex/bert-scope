tldr: This article discusses the author's spectroscopic observations of the sun's chromosphere and prominences from September 1, 1872, to December 31, 1873. The authors also present a revised view of the Amperean theory of magnetism, suggesting that magnetism is due to definite directions of molecular structure rather than continuously circulating electric currents. This new perspective explains the magnetic properties of various substances, including non-ferruginous materials like cyanite and stannite.
