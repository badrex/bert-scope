tldr: The authors applied the method of coincidence counting to study the -rays emitted by uranium Z and radioactive silver Ag, providing insights into nuclear isomerism and the behavior of radioactive nuclei. This method allowed them to investigate the time-correlation in the emission of -radiation and understand the processes of de-excitation and quantum emission in radioactive elements.
