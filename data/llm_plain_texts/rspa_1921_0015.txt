tldr: "This article discusses the purity of sound produced by an ordinary Seebeck siren and explores the problem of designing a siren to produce a pure tone. The authors present a theory to approximate the relative intensities of the fundamental tone and its harmonics in a siren. They then create a new siren design with improved purity of tone, reducing the intensity of higher harmonics and increasing the concentration of energy in the fundamental tone."
