tldr: This article investigates the formation of jets in oscillatory viscous flows, focusing on the interaction between boundary layers and the surrounding fluid. The authors use numerical methods to analyze the flow around a cylinder and demonstrate the development of a jet-like flow. They also discuss the limitations of the boundary-layer equations and propose a viscous-inviscid interactive procedure to better understand the behavior of these flows.
