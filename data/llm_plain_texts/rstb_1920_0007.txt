tldr: The authors discovered nerve-end cells in the dental pulp that play a crucial role in tooth development. These cells have a stellate form and are connected to the odontoblast layer, contributing to the formation of the tooth's dentine. The nerve-end cells communicate with the deep plexus and form a network around the odontoblasts, providing essential information for tooth growth and development.
