tldr: The author investigates enhanced lines in the spectra of various elements when passing from the arc to a high-temperature spark. They find that these enhanced lines are present in the spectra of hotter stars and the solar chromosphere. The study reveals that the chromosphere is a region of high temperature with a simplified spectrum compared to cooler regions where Fraunhofer absorption occurs.
