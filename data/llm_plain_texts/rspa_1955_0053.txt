tldr: The authors investigated the atomic distribution and angular intensity distribution of liquid helium using X-ray scattering techniques. They found no significant change in the intensity distribution accompanying the -point transformation, suggesting that the -point transition may be related to a condensation phenomenon rather than a structural change. The atomic distribution function may be correlated with a lattice structure that could account for some of the unique properties of liquid helium.
