tldr: This article discusses crystallographic studies on the structure and function of lysozyme, an enzyme found in egg whites and known for its ability to break down bacterial cell walls. The researchers discovered how lysozyme interacts with its substrates and located the parts of the enzyme molecule that interact with competitive inhibitors, providing insights into the enzyme's activity and the structural basis of its function.
