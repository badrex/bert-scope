tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the circulation and fate of lymphocytes in rats. They discovered that the majority of small lymphocytes in the blood are part of a large pool that circulates from the blood into the lymph and back into the blood. The main route for this circulation is through the lymph nodes. The authors also observed the behavior of large lymphocytes, which mainly migrate to the wall of the gut and develop into primitive plasma cells. These findings provide insights into the immune system and the role of lymphocytes in the body.
