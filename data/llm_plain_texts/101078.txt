tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the compressibility of air in sea-water at various depths. They used two instruments, a glass bottle and a glass cylinder, to measure the compression of air at different depths. The results were used to create a table showing the compression of air at various depths, which can be useful for divers and those using diving bells for recovery of lost items in water.
