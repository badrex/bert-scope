tldr: In 1761, Sir Francis Haskins Eyles Stiles reported an eruption of Mount Vesuvius in a letter to Philip Carteret Webb. The eruption produced a vast column of black smoke and caused significant damage. Stiles also mentioned two other eruptions at the mountain's foot and discussed the lava flow's direction. He shared the experiences of Mr. Lowther and Mr. Watson, who were at the mountain during the eruption.
