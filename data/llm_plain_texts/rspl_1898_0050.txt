tldr: This article investigates the heat dissipated by a platinum surface at high temperatures and the emissivity of platinum in various gases. The authors also study the effects of different factors on the heat dissipation and radiation emitted by platinum. They compare various formulas to determine the best expression for the thermal radiation and provide a formula for the intrinsic brilliancy of a platinum surface with temperature.
