tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effects of heat on ethylene, a simple hydrocarbon. They found that when heated, ethylene decomposes into methane, ethane, and liquid products. The results challenge previous theories about the decomposition of ethylene and provide a better understanding of the processes in the manufacture of coal gas and other related industrial processes.
