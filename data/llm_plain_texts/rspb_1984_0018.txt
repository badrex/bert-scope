tldr: This study investigates whether marine sponges can differentiate between symbiotic bacteria and seawater bacteria. Researchers fed four sponge species with tritium-labeled bacteria and observed that a large proportion of symbiotic bacteria passed through the sponge, while seawater bacteria were retained. The results suggest that sponges may have a mechanism to recognize and reject symbiotic bacteria, possibly due to their capsular sheaths.
