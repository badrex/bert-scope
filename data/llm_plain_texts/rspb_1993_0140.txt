tldr: The study investigates the evolution of copulatory organs, internal fertilization, placentae, and viviparity in killifishes (Cyprinodontiformes) using a DNA phylogeny of the tyrosine kinase gene X-src. The research finds that internal fertilization, modifications of the male's anal fin to form a copulatory organ, and viviparity likely evolved independently three times in cyprinodontiform fishes. Livebearing (viviparity) evolved only in the subfamily Poeciliinae, while advanced forms of viviparity with placenta-like structures evolved at least three times from egg-laying ancestors.
