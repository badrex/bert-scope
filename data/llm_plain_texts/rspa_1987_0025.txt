tldr: This article investigates the linear stability of wind-driven water waves, focusing on short-scale waves. The study finds that these waves are driven predominantly by surface tension, local shear stresses, and viscous forces, with gravity and other factors playing a lesser role. The findings agree with observations of "cat's paws" on wind-driven water surfaces and provide insights into the dynamics of the ocean surface, affecting atmospheric drag, radar "snow," and microwave backscatter.
