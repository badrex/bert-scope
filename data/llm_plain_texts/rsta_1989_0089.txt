tldr: The authors developed a molecular dynamics model to study the melting and glass transition processes in a two-dimensional material. They observed that the transition from a solid to a melt occurs when liquid-like structural elements composed of five- and seven-sided Voronoi polygons percolate through the two-dimensional structure. The simulation, using empirical pair potentials, provides insights into the topological features of local atomic configurations during melting and vitrification.
