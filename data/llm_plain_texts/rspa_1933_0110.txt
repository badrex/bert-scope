tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate the deposition of sputtered films on glass and metal surfaces near the cathode. They found that sputtered films do not have a critical density for deposition like vaporized films. The experiments also showed that the rate of deposition is not significantly affected by temperature changes, and the deposit on a cooled surface has a different structure, making it more visible.
