tldr: The authors investigate the development of preferred orientations during the freezing of metals and alloys. They examine the connection between solidification texture and the morphologies of decanted freezing interfaces. Their experiments with lead, zinc, magnesium, tin, bismuth, and a-brass alloy show that the preferred orientations are determined by the morphologies of the freezing interfaces. The results can be explained by the mechanism of crystal growth, which is the edgewise extension of closely packed planes in directions close to the plane of the solid/liquid interface.
