tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the scattering of slow neutrons by various elements. They used a method that involved measuring the cross-sections relative to carbon, which has a negligible cross-section for true absorption. The results showed that the scattering cross-sections for slow neutrons varied among different elements, and the authors discussed the implications of their findings.
