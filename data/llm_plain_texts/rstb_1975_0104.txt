tldr: This study examines the histological changes in the thymus glands of the red-billed quelea, a weaver-bird species. The research investigates the different cell types and their distribution in the thymus glands of various life stages, including embryos, juveniles, and adults. The authors propose a cycle of events that explains the observed changes in the thymus gland size and structure, particularly the development of erythroid cells in the cortex. The findings contribute to the understanding of erythropoiesis within the thymus and its significance in the bird's life cycle.
