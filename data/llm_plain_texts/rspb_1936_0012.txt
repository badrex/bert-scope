tldr: The author explores the mechanisms of nerve excitation and accommodation by studying the changes in local potential and threshold when an electric current is passed through a living excitable tissue. They introduce the concept of accommodation, which describes the increase in threshold when the local potential is maintained, and discuss the time-constants involved in the processes of excitation and accommodation. The findings contribute to a better understanding of how nerves return to their resting state and how they respond to different types of electrical stimulation.
