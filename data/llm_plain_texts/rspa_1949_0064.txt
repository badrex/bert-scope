tldr: This article discusses the spontaneous deformation and unique crystal movements observed in protocatechuic acid crystals. The deformation is attributed to the progressive gliding of lattice planes in two configurations, one stable and the other unstable. The author provides a detailed explanation of the crystal movements and the underlying molecular processes involved in the deformation.
