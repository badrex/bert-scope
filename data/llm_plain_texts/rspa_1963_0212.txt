tldr: This article investigates the reflexion of a pulse in a solid sphere using wave equations and boundary conditions. The authors calculate the pulse shape near the caustics and the axis, providing a method for estimating the initial values of the potentials immediately after reflexion. They also apply Kirchhoff's formula to obtain the pulse shape in terms of integrals involving the distribution.
