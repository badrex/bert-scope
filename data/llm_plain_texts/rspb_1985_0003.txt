tldr: Researchers discovered that cells in the macaque temporal cortex are sensitive to different views of faces and gaze direction. They found that cells in the region respond more to the full face view and that different views of the head activate different populations of cells. This study suggests that the recognition of objects may proceed via the independent analysis of several restricted views of the object.
