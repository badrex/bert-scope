tldr: Sir William Thomson proposes a new design for Daniell's battery that eliminates the need for a porous cell, using gravity and density differences to keep the two electrolyte solutions separate. This design offers improved efficiency and constancy, making it a potentially superior alternative to traditional porous-cell batteries.
