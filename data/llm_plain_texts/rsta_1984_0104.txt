tldr: The authors experimentally observed optical bistability in indium arsenide at low power levels and theoretically predicted it for a new class of nonlinear dielectrics. They demonstrated that the dynamic Burstein-Moss shift is responsible for the large nonlinear index in indium arsenide at the band gap. The findings suggest the potential for an impressive room-temperature computational capability using indium arsenide.
