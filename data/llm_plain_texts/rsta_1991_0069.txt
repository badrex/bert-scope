tldr: The authors develop a coherent structure model of the turbulent boundary layer, focusing on the outer and wall region subsets. They analyze the contributions of coherent motions, such as large-scale motions, typical eddies, and their interactions, to the Reynolds stress. The model predicts Reynolds number dependence and provides insights into turbulence production and evolution in boundary layers.
