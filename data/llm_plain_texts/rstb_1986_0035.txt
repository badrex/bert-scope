tldr: This article examines the defensive strategies of modular aquatic invertebrates, such as Porifera, Bryozoa, and some Coelenterata and Tunicata, against predation, epibiosis, and endobiosis. It compares and contrasts the defense mechanisms of modular and unitary organisms, as well as motile and immotile ones. The study finds that less motile organisms tend to use consolidated and unconsolidated skeletal reinforcement and secondary substances for defense, while modular organisms are more likely to use passively dispensed chemical substances. This may be a response to the increased risks of pathogenic infection faced by modular biota due to their susceptibility to frequent wounding and partial mortality.
