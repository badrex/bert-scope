tldr: The article presents a new and exact solution for the diffraction of an E-polarized electromagnetic wave by an imperfectly conducting wedge. The original boundary-value problem is reduced to solving a linear difference equation, which is solved in terms of the double gamma function. The solution for the field components is obtained, showing good agreement with experimental results in the shadow region for normal incidence on a wedge.
