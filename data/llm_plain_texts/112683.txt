tldr: The author investigates the lunar atmospheric tide at Melbourne by analyzing barometric pressure observations from the Flagstaff Observatory. They discovered a regular pattern in the data, suggesting the moon's influence on Earth's atmosphere. The study also found that other factors, such as the combined action of the sun and moon, may affect atmospheric tides.
