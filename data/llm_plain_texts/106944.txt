tldr: 'In this article, William Herschel discusses his observations of the sun and its spots. He proposes that solar spots are similar to atmospheric changes on Earth and that the sun has an atmosphere composed of various fluids. Herschel also explores the possibility of the sun having surface inequalities, which could be responsible for the appearance of solar spots.'
