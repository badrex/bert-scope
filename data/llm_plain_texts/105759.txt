tldr: John Ellis and William Aiton discovered a method to preserve acorns in beeswax for a year without planting them, allowing them to be in a state fit for vegetation. This technique could be used to bring valuable seeds from distant locations, such as the East Indies, to plant for the benefit of American colonies.
