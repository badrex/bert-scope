tldr: The authors conducted electrophysiological experiments on the dogfish brain to study the projection of the posterior lateral-line nerve to the lateral-line lobes. They found that the largest field potentials were recorded on the ipsilateral posterior lateral-line lobe, and the molecular layer was not involved in this sensory projection. The study provides information on the behavior of second-order cells in response to lateral-line inputs and confirms the projection of the lateral-line nerves to the lobes.
