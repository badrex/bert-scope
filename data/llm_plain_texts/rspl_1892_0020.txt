tldr: The committee on color vision appointed by the Royal Society examined over 500 individuals to understand color vision and its testing methods. They recommend specific employment roles that require normal color vision to be scheduled by a central authority. They also suggest using Holmgren's wool test and Snellen's test for form vision. The committee emphasizes the importance of periodic inspection of testing stations and the use of uniform colors for signals and lights on ships and railways.
