tldr: The authors study the stability of vortex flows with a power-law vorticity distribution. They find that the vortex is stable for certain conditions and unstable for others, with the growth rate of unstable waves being surprisingly small. The results provide insights into the behavior of vortices in various applications, such as wing-tip vortices and helicopter blades.
