tldr: In a letter to Peter Collinson, F.R.S., William Gostling describes the observation of a fire-ball and mock-suns on December 11 and 19, 1742. He reports the course of the fire-ball and the explosion heard by Lord Cowper. The occurrence of haloes, mentioned by Dampier, was followed by a long season of stormy weather.
