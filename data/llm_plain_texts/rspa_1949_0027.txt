tldr: The author, A.G. Ogston, improves and extends the Gouy diffusiometer, a method for measuring diffusion constants, by applying a modified ray theory. The experiments show that the method works well with single substances and mixtures, allowing for the analysis of the homogeneity of diffusing substances and the accurate description of the movement of the whole band system. This leads to testing the form of the boundary and using the method at lower differences of refractive index between solution and solvent.
