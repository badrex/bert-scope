tldr: The author conducted experiments and observations on a calf and its amniotic fluid to determine if the fetus is nourished by the fluid. They found that hairs from the fetus's skin were present in the amniotic fluid, suggesting that the fluid enters the fetal digestive system and provides nourishment. This discovery challenges the prevailing belief that the fetus is solely nourished by blood through the umbilical cord.
