tldr: 'The author, Arthur Schuster, investigates the harmonic ratios in the spectra of various gases, such as magnesium and iron. He examines the wavelengths of light emitted by these elements and finds that the ratios of these wavelengths often form simple numerical relationships, suggesting a possible underlying harmonic structure. However, he concludes that more research is needed to determine if this is due to a previously undiscovered law or simply coincidences.'
