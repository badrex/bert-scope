tldr: The authors isolated and analyzed the genes for Factor B and C2, components of the complement system. They used cDNA clones and techniques like Southern blot analysis and DNA sequence analysis to study the genes' structure and organization. The findings provide insights into the genetic basis of complement deficiencies and the evolution of these proteins.
