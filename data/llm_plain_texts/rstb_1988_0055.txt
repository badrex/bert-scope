tldr: This article discusses the complex responses of germ cells to mutagenic agents and the challenges in studying germ cells in humans. The author highlights the importance of understanding the effects of radiation, chemicals, and other factors on mutation rates and their potential impact on genetic diseases. The research focuses on experimental work in animals, including the effects of radiation on different germ cell stages and the relationship between dose-response and genetic sensitivity.
