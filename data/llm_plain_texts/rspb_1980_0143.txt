tldr: The study investigates the association between herpes simplex virus (HSV) and squamous carcinoma of the cervix. Using in situ hybridization, the researchers found that HSV RNA was present in 79% of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and 66% of squamous carcinoma samples, but not in primary cervical adenocarcinomas. The study also focused on the virus thymidine kinase gene, which may play a role in the development of cervical cancer.
