tldr: The authors studied how radioactivity from [Me-14C] methionine and [2-14C] glycine gets incorporated into the lipids of Rhodopseudomonas spheroides. They found that radioactivity was mainly incorporated into phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and ornithine lipid. The study also demonstrated a precursor-product relationship between the methylated phospholipids and phosphatidylcholine, and showed that the a-carbon of glycine gives rise to one-carbon fragments and acetate.
