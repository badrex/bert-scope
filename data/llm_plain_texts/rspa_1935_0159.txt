tldr: The author presents a statistical theory of turbulence and its decay, using experimental data to validate the theory. The study focuses on the correlation between turbulent components of velocity at two points in a turbulent flow and the decay of turbulence in an air stream behind grids and honeycombs. The findings support the idea that the constant A in the equation for the decay of turbulence is a universal constant for all square-mesh grids.
