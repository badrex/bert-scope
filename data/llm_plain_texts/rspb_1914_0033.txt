tldr: The author investigates the decomposition of formates by Bacillus coli communis and how it is affected by artificial selection. They found that some strains of the bacteria lose the ability to decompose formic acid, which can be used as a criterion to determine if a strain has been recently derived from a gas-producing strain. The author also discovered that formic acid and sugar mutually help each other in the decomposition process, maintaining a neutral environment for the bacteria to thrive.
