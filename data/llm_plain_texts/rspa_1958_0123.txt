tldr: The authors discuss the initiation and growth of explosions in solids, focusing on the initiation of explosions by neutrons, α-particles, and fission products. They investigate the effects of nuclear radiation on explosives and find that no obvious correlation exists between radiation resistance and thermal stability, mechanical sensitivity, or ignition temperature.
