tldr: The author compared the readings of the Earth's magnetic field given by different magnetometers at various observatories in Great Britain. They employed a new method using a coil and a magnetic needle to measure the horizontal component of the Earth's magnetic field. The results showed a discrepancy with the Kew Observatory standard instrument, and the author discussed possible reasons for this difference.
