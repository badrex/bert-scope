tldr: This article investigates the physiological actions of ammonium salts and alkaline earths on the nervous system and muscles. The authors found that different salts have varying effects on spinal cord stimulation, motor nerve paralysis, and muscle contraction. They also discovered significant antagonism between certain substances, where one substance could neutralize or counteract the effects of another. This study contributes to the understanding of the complex interactions between chemical compounds and their physiological actions.
