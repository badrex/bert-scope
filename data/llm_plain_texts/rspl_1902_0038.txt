tldr: The author conducted experiments on human skin to study its electrical properties and response to various stimuli. They discovered that healthy skin has an outgoing current and a positive response to stimulation, while moribund skin has a variable and weaker response. The author also found that the conductivity of living skin increases with tetanisation, while boiled skin has a lower conductivity. The skin's response to stimulation is influenced by its previous excitation and the vitality of the skin varies locally.
