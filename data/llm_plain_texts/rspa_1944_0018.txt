tldr: The author investigates the duration of the Balmer spectrum in excited hydrogen and finds that it lasts much longer than current theories and experimental determinations suggest. The discrepancy between the observed duration and theoretical predictions is significant, indicating a fundamental issue with the current understanding of the hydrogen atom's behavior. The experiments provide evidence that the fall in intensity takes 10^-5 seconds, rather than the 10^-8 seconds predicted by other investigations.
