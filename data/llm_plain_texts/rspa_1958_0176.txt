tldr: The authors conducted experiments on ultrasonic absorption and velocity in various liquefied gases, including carbon dioxide, sulphur hexafluoride, nitrous oxide, cyclopropane, and methyl chloride. They found that the observed nonclassical absorption is entirely due to vibrational relaxation, and the total vibrational specific heat relaxes with a single relaxation time. The results are consistent with the assumption that vibrational transitions in liquids occur through binary collisions between molecules.
