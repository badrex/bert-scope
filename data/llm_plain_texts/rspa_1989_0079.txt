tldr: This article presents further studies of the enhanced nuclear magnet in thulium phosphate. The authors fit the crystal-field parameters to the resonance results and discuss the Orbach-Aminov relaxation rate. They also report measurements of phonon velocities and acoustic magnetic resonance at 0.7 GHz, comparing the direct spin-lattice relaxation rates with results from other methods. The findings contribute to the understanding of enhanced nuclear paramagnets and their properties.
