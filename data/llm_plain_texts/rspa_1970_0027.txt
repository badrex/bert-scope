semantic_tags:

tldr: The authors propose a new scheme for defining and classifying atomic shell states using group theory and quasi-particles. They factor the spin-up and spin-down spaces into two parts, creating a more complete classification system and providing a direct explanation for certain features in atomic configurations.
