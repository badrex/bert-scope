tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the influence of chemical energy of electrolytes on the electromotive force of a voltaic couple. They found that the electromotive force changes with the addition of different substances and that the minimum proportion of a substance required to upset the voltaic balance is very small. This research can be used as a test of chemical composition and to examine the state of combination when dissolved.
