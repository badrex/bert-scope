tldr: The authors conducted an investigation of the term structures and hyperfine structures of bismuth Bi III and Bi II spectra. They used a unique electrodeless discharge source to excite the bismuth vapor and obtained new experimental data by photographing spectra from 1000 A to 10,000 A. Their findings confirmed previous term analyses and provided more accurate values for wave numbers and hyperfine structure intervals.
