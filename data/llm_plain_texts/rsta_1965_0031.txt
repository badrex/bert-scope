tldr: This article discusses a symposium on continental drift, focusing on geochronology and the North Atlantic region. The authors present a geometrical fit of the land masses of northern Europe, Canada, and Greenland, using a method devised by Sir Edward Bullard and Mr. J. E. Everett. They also investigate the radiometric ages of metamorphic and granitic rocks and their geographical distribution on a reconstructed landmass, providing evidence for continental drift. The article highlights the differences in age and composition between the continental landmasses and the Atlantic Ocean floor, and the authors attempt to show the geochronological patterns resulting from periods of metamorphism and mountain building over thousands of millions of years.
