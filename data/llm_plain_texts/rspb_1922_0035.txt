tldr: The authors conducted experiments on liver and spleen autolysis to study the synthesis and destruction of cholesterol. They found no evidence of synthesis or destruction of cholesterol during autolysis, which contradicts previous findings by other researchers. This study highlights the importance of careful experimental design and extraction processes in understanding cholesterol metabolism in the body.
