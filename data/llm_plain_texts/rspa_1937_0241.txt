tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the temperature variation of the work function of clean and thoriated tungsten. They used an experimental tube to measure the rate at which the contact potential difference between a standard source of electrons and a tungsten filament varied with the temperature of the latter. The results showed that the work function of clean tungsten increased by 0.05 eV when heated from around 300-400 K to 1070 K. The work function of fully activated thoriated tungsten also exhibited a temperature dependence, with the contact potential difference decreasing as the temperature increased.
