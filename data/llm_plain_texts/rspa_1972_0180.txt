tldr: The authors conducted high-resolution Auger emission and low-energy electron diffraction studies on the chemisorption of unsaturated molecules on the (100) surface of platinum. They found that chemisorption significantly modifies some Auger transition probabilities involving platinum-valence electrons and observed a net electron transfer from platinum to the ligand in the case of carbon monoxide adsorption. The surface configuration of adsorbed carbon monoxide was defined by a Fourier analysis of the LEED data, revealing both terminal and bridging carbonyl groups.
