tldr: The authors investigated the electrochemistry of cochlear endolymph in rats, focusing on its electrical potential and ionic composition. They discovered that the endolymph's high potassium and low sodium concentrations are maintained by an active transport mechanism, which is dependent on oxidative metabolism. This study provides insights into the physiological mechanisms of the hearing process and may help understand disorders like Meniere's disease.
