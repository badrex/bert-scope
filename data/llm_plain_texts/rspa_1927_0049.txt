revised_title: 'Investigations on Flame Speeds During the Initial Stages of Gaseous Explosions'
semantic_tags:

  - Combustion
  - Flame propagation
  - Explosion safety
tldr: This article investigates the initial stages of gaseous explosions, focusing on flame speeds during the initial "uniform movement." The authors use both photographic and electrical methods to measure flame speeds and study the behavior of various mixtures, including oxygen and combustible gases. They find that flame speeds during the initial stages of gaseous explosions can be measured with reasonable accuracy and that the methods used in this study can provide valuable insights into explosion safety.
