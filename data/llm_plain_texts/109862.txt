tldr: 'The author, David Brewster, studied the structure of the crystalline lens in fishes and quadrupeds using polarized light. He discovered that the lens has a complex structure with a central nucleus, an outer spherical shell, and an intermediate shell in a state of contraction. This structure is essential for correcting spherical aberration and plays a crucial role in the action of polarized light. Brewster also found that the cornea has a similar texture to the nucleus of the crystalline lens.'
