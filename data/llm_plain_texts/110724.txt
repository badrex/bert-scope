tldr: The author, James Blake, conducted experiments on the effects of various inorganic compounds when introduced directly into the blood. He found that salts with the same base exert similar actions on the body. The experiments showed that certain salts, like those of magnesia and zinc, could arrest the heart's action and cause muscle prostration. Other salts, like those of copper, lime, strontia, and lead, had unique effects on muscle tissue, causing contractions even after death. The author also noted the similarities in the actions of salts of silver and lead on the lungs and the systemic capillaries.
