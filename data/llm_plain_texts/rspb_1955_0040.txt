  - Heterosis
  - Inbreeding
  - Outbreeding
tldr: 'The author discusses the concept of hybrid vigour and its genetical basis, explaining that it is a regular property of hybrids in naturally outbreeding species. They explore the importance of gene content and the significance of inbreeding and cross-breeding in relation to vigour and stability of development. The author also highlights the role of chromosome structure and breeding systems in the phenomenon of heterosis.'
