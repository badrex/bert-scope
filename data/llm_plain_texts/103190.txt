tldr: The author observed and studied the behavior and structure of tiny organisms called animalcula found on duckweed using a microscope. They discovered that these creatures move in a wheel-like motion and consume small particles in the water for nourishment. The author also found that these creatures cannot move from place to place and must rely on their unique circular motion to draw in food particles. This research highlights the complexity and design of these tiny organisms and the importance of microscopic observation in understanding their behavior and purpose.
