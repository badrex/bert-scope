tldr: 'The article presents a model for understanding escalating signals in animal displays. It explores the optimal strategies for animals to use when advertising their worth through a series of signals, taking into account factors such as fatigue and motivation. The model suggests that animals may choose to escalate their signals in intensity, starting low and only increasing subsequent to initial signals proving unsuccessful. This research has implications for understanding communication and competition in animal behavior.'
