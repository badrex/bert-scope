tldr: The authors discovered new bands in the secondary spectrum of hydrogen, which they called "Type-II Bands." These bands are characterized by groups of series, each group containing three to five bands. The study of these bands led to the suggestion that a new quantum number might be responsible for the horizontal spacing of 92 wave-numbers, which is a prominent feature of these regularities.
