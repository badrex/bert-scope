tldr: This study investigates the effect of tangential force on the contact area between elastic solids, specifically the reduction in contact area when a tangential force acts. The authors derive an equation to describe this effect and verify it through experiments using rubber hemispheres pressed against a glass flat. The results show a clear reduction in contact area with increasing tangential force, supporting the theoretical conclusion.
