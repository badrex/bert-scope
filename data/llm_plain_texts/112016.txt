tldr: The authors describe a simplified method for synthesizing lactic acid derivatives using zinc and a mixture of iodide and oxalate of methyl. They obtain a new acid, dimethoxalic acid, which they study and compare to other lactic acid derivatives. This method provides a larger product and avoids the need for producing zincethyl, making it a more efficient process.
