tldr: The study investigates the inward current generated by Na-Ca exchange during the action potential in single atrial cells of the rabbit. The researchers used the whole-cell patch-clamp technique to record the inward current during repolarizations following a brief depolarizing pulse. The results suggest that the inward current contributes to the generation of the late plateau phase of the rabbit atrial action potential and is activated by intracellular calcium released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.
