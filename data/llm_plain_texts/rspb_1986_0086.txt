tldr: This study investigates the factors responsible for karyotypic polymorphism in the common shrew, Sorex araneus. Researchers found that the polymorphism involves different combinations of chromosome arms in various karyotypic races. The study aims to understand the maintenance of this polymorphism and its implications on the common shrew's biology.
