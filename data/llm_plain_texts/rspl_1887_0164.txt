tldr: This article presents a study on the ultra-violet spectra of cobalt and nickel. The authors compare the results obtained using different gratings and find a general resemblance between the two spectra, but no exact correspondence due to their close chemical relationship. They provide a list of 580 ultra-violet lines of cobalt and 408 lines of nickel, along with a map of each spectrum to the same scale as AngstrÃ¶m's normal solar spectrum.
