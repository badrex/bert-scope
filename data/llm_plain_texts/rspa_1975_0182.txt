tldr: The authors developed a double-pass Sisam spectrometer with simplified design for the near-infrared region, achieving a resolution of 0.06 at 1.6 and maintaining it over a wide spectral range without realigning the optical components. This spectrometer offers a significant gain in signal-to-noise ratio compared to traditional slit spectrometers, making it suitable for studying weak emission and absorption spectra in the infrared region.
