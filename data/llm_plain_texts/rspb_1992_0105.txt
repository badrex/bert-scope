tldr: The study found that 17,20-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one 20-sulphate, a steroid, is a potent odorant in precocious male Atlantic salmon parr that have been pre-exposed to the urine of ovulated females. The olfactory epithelium of these fish only responds to the steroid after stimulation with the urine of ovulated female Atlantic salmon. This discovery suggests a possible role for the steroid in the physiology of Atlantic salmon.
