tldr: The authors studied the growth forms and skeletal variations in fungid corals, including Fungia, Herpetolitha, Polyphyllia, Doderleinia, Halomitra, and Podabacia. They observed the development of subsidiary calicinal centers and the arrangement of septa in these corals, providing insights into their evolutionary relationships and classification.
