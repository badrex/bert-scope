tldr: The author, Martin Barry, discusses the similarities and differences between the chorda dorsalis in mammalian and other vertebrate embryos. He compares the findings of previous researchers, such as Von Baer and Reichert, and suggests that further investigation into early embryonic development is necessary to understand the composition of the embryo's rudiments.
