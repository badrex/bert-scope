tldr: The authors analyze the electron distribution in silicon using X-ray structure factors and theoretical estimates of free atom Hartree-Fock wavefunctions. They find that a radially compressed valence-shell form factor provides an excellent fit using Kubic Harmonics. The study also confirms previous estimates of anharmonic force constants and measures X-ray Debye temperatures for silicon at different temperatures.
