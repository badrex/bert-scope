tldr: This article investigates the acoustic axes and degeneracies in orthorhombic media, which are directions in an anisotropic medium where multiple points exist on the slowness surface for elastic waves. The study focuses on the implications of different orderings of stiffnesses in orthorhombic elastic media and the resulting slowness sections. The article provides a detailed account of the possible degeneracies and their properties, such as conical and tangential double points, and discusses the phenomenon of internal conical refraction of elastic waves.
