tldr: The article discusses the structure of myosin elements in vertebrate smooth muscles using low-angle X-ray diffraction experiments. The authors discovered a regular assembly of myosin molecules in the form of filamentous elements with a minimum lateral dimension of at least 60 nm. The structure of these myosin elements remains unchanged in various muscle states, suggesting that they are present in relaxed muscles and interact with actin during contraction.
