tldr: The author investigated the electrical properties of various metals and minerals, particularly the grey oxide of manganese, and their impact on the galvanometer needle. They observed that the crystallized grey oxide of manganese had a higher electro-negative scale than other materials. The author also discussed the geological implications of these findings, suggesting that the electrical properties of metalliferous veins and rocks could have an important influence on nature's economy.
