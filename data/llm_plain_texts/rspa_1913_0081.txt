tldr: The authors discuss a case of abnormal trichromatic color vision caused by a shift in the green-sensation curve. They explain how to detect this shift using a spectrum test and describe the effects of the shift on color perception. They also provide examples of how the shift affects color matching and the luminosity curve for a displacement of 2 S.S.N. towards the red.
