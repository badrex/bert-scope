tldr: The authors conducted experiments on rabbits, guinea-pigs, and mice to determine the blood volume in mammals and its relationship to body weight and surface area. They found that small animals have a relatively higher blood volume percentage compared to larger animals of the same species. The results of these experiments can help in understanding diseases and their treatments.
