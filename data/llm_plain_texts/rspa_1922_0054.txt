revised_title: 'Addressing Errors in the Measurement of Unsymmetrical Spectrum Lines'
semantic_tags:
  - Spectroscopy
  - Error analysis
  - Spectral line broadening
  - Wave-length determination
  - Asymmetrical lines
tldr: The authors discuss the errors that arise in the measurement of unsymmetrical spectrum lines due to mechanical and temperature-related displacements. They propose a method to reduce these errors and emphasize the importance of using symmetrical spectra as standards for accurate wave-length determinations.
