tldr: The author presents a new method for grinding and polishing spherical glasses using an engine with mandrils, which he believes to be more precise and efficient than traditional hand methods. He addresses objections raised by another scientist and explains how his method can be applied to create long object-glasses for telescopes. The author also claims that with his method, it is possible to make plano-convex glasses for telescopes with a single eyepiece that can magnify up to a thousand times.
