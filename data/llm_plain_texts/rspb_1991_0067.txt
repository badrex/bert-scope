tldr: The authors investigated the types of excitatory amino acid receptors in cerebellar Purkinje cells using patch-clamp recording techniques. They found that these cells lack functional NMDA receptors and that non-NMDA receptors activated by s-AMPA are linked to channels of low unitary conductance. This study provides insights into the role of different receptors in synaptic transmission in Purkinje cells.
