tldr: The author clarifies that a light-brown fungus mentioned in a previous article on Filix mas seed vessels appears when the seeds are full-ripe. The fungus initially covers the seed vessels like a cap and later turns brown, curling up as the seeds ripen. This corrects the earlier description of the fungus's appearance.
