tldr: 'The article discusses the role of apoptosis, or programmed cell death, in the development of the nematode C. elegans. Genetic studies have identified 14 genes involved in this process, defining a genetic pathway for apoptosis in C. elegans. The authors describe the roles of key genes, such as ced-3, ced-4, and ced-9, and their similarities to proteins affecting apoptosis in vertebrates. They also discuss how cell-death specification genes, like ces-1, ces-2, and egl-1, influence the decision of certain cells to live or die.'
