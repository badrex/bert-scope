tldr: The author conducted experiments with various metal compounds, such as zinc, copper, and tin, to study their effects on chlorophyll and phyllocyanin. They discovered that these compounds form different compounds with phyllocyanin, which have varying degrees of stability when exposed to air and light. The author also found that the action of tin on phyllocyanin in hydrochloric acid produces a red-colored substance, which resembles the pigments found in some red flowers.
