tldr: The article is a biographical memoir of Robert Gwyn MacFarlane, an experimental haematologist who transformed the study of blood clotting into a scientific subject. His work created a global school of coagulationists and revolutionized the treatment for hemophilia and other bleeding disorders. MacFarlane's interest in hematology began with a case of a child who almost bled to death, which led him to study the mysterious disorder and contribute significantly to the field.
