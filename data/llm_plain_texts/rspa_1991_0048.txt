tldr: The authors present a theoretical analysis of the angular distribution of the submarine light field and its modification by multiple scattering. They develop an analytical approach to calculate the coefficient of upward scattering for any given incident light field in a medium where the volume scattering is known. This method offers a deeper insight into the nature of multiple scattering in the ocean and can be applied in the calculation of the average cosine and the transmittance of downwelling irradiance.
