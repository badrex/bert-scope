tldr: The article presents an account of the molecular orbital theory of chemical valency, focusing on the properties of the electronic charge density function in the first and higher approximations. It applies this theory to conjugated molecules, providing a simple understanding of the relationship between bond order and bond length in both symmetrical and unsymmetrical bonds. The study also explains how to express any diagonal element of the charge-density matrix in terms of basic constants and terms accounting for differences in electron spins and charge drifts between orbitals.
