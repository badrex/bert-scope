tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of included oxide films on the structure of the Beilby layer. They found that during repeated sliding, oxide particles are included beneath the metal surface, preventing grain growth and contributing to the fine grain size of the Beilby layer. This process has implications for understanding the formation of the Beilby layer and the behavior of surfaces during friction.
