tldr: The author investigates the expulsion of magnetic flux by eddies in a highly conducting fluid. They demonstrate that eddies distort magnetic field lines, amplifying the field and concentrating it outside the eddy. This process occurs in a time smaller than the resistive decay time, and it is applied to the sun, where concentrated fields inhibit local convection.
