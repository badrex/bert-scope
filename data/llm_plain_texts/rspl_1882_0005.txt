tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the specific resistance of mercury and compared their results with previous studies. They used four tubes of varying lengths and diameters to measure the resistance and found that the value of the mercury unit is close to that of Siemens' experiments. The results were combined with the determination of the B.A. unit in absolute measure to obtain the resistance in CGS units.
