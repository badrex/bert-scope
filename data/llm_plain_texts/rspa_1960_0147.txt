tldr: This article presents the results of measurements of the magnetic susceptibilities and specific heats of various transition element alloys, including palladium-rhodium, platinum-gold, and platinum-iridium. The study investigates the thermal and magnetic properties of these alloys, providing insights into their phase diagrams and the behavior of their constituents. The findings contribute to the understanding of the relationship between the number of holes in the d-band of transition elements and their properties upon alloying.
