tldr: This study investigates the triboelectricity and friction in metals and solid elements, focusing on the quantitative results for silica. The authors develop a rubbing apparatus to measure the potential difference (PD) values and create a list of PD values for various materials. They also discuss the relationship between the triboelectric series and the Volta contact series, and explore the factors involved in the process of rubbing two solids.
