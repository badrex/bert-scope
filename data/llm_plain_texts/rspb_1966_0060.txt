tldr: The study investigates the effects of irradiation on germ cells in immature male rats. The results show that irradiation at birth affects the development of germ cells, leading to changes in the population of spermatogonia and the overall process of spermatogenesis. The research provides insights into the recovery process of testes after exposure to radiation and the potential impact on fertility.
