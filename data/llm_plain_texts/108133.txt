tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the source of the dark color of venous blood and the formation of carbonic acid. They found that venous blood contains carbonic acid and that it can absorb this gas without being exposed to the air. The author also discovered that the air-pump can remove carbonic acid from the blood, and that hydrogen has the ability to remove carbonic acid through a membrane. These findings contribute to the understanding of respiration and blood circulation.
