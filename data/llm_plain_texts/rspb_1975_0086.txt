tldr: The authors discovered two fertile female chimaeras with mixed sex chromosome constitution, XX/XY, in mice. One of these chimaeras produced a son with an exceptional karyotype of 41,XXY, which is associated with Klinefelter syndrome. This finding suggests that functional reversal of germ cells can occur in mouse chimaeras, challenging previous assumptions about their genetic behavior.
