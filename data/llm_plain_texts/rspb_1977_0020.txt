tldr: The authors studied the anatomy and structure of the lateral-line lobes in the dogfish cerebellum. They found that these lobes have a cerebellar-like organization and are possibly the most primitive portion of the complete cerebellum. The lateral-line lobes are related to the acoustico-lateralis sensory system and are absent in higher vertebrates. The study provides insights into the evolution of the cerebellum and its structure.
