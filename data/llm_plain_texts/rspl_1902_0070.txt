tldr: This study investigates the correlation between mental and physical characters in humans, focusing on intelligence and physical measurements. The authors find that there is no significant correlation between intelligence and head measurements, and that athletic abilities are slightly correlated with intelligence. The results suggest that athletic boys tend to be healthier, more popular, and more intelligent than non-athletic boys.
