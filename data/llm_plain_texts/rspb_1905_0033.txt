tldr: This article discusses the morphology and development of the ungulate placenta, focusing on the sheep, elephant, and hyrax. It describes two main types of placentation: plicate and cumulate, and their corresponding behaviors in the trophoblast. The study shows that the ungulate order is more closely connected with the Proboscidea, Sirenia, and Carnivora than with other mammal groups, while the hyracoidea's placentation suggests no connection with those groups.
