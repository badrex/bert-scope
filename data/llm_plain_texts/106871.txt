tldr: The author, Isaac Dalby, used triangulation to determine the longitudes of Dunkirk and Paris from Greenwich, assuming the Earth to be an ellipsoid. The study aimed to compare the results with the measured arc of the meridian between Greenwich and Paris. The findings suggest that the ratio of the Earth's axes is close to the ratio proposed by Sir Isaac Newton.
