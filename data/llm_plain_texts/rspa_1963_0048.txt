tldr: The authors studied the gas phase oxidation of n-butene-1, n-butene-2, and trans-butene-2 using conventional kinetic techniques and gas chromatography. They found that all three olefins produced similar products, but with different proportions and oxidation rates. A mechanism based on the ethylene oxidation system accounts for these differences. Acetaldehyde acts as a degenerate branching agent, and the maximum reaction rate is related to its concentration. The study provides insights into the oxidation mechanisms of higher olefins, which are increasingly important as intermediates in the oxidation of saturated hydrocarbons.
