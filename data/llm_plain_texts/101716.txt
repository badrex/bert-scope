tldr: 'The article discusses the method used by English mathematician Richard Norwood to measure the distance between York and London in 1636. By measuring the angles and distances, he calculated the length of a degree of a great circle on Earth, which was 367,200 feet or 69.14 English miles. This measurement is compared to the French method, showing a close similarity.'
