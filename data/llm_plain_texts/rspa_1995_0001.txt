tldr: The authors present a new mapping method for solving the equations of magnetohydrodynamics, focusing on dynamo action in rapidly rotating, electrically conducting fluids. This method allows for the study of the decay rate of magnetic fields in a stationary sphere and various types of dynamos. The authors also explore an intermediate dynamo model that partially accounts for the dynamics of the system.
