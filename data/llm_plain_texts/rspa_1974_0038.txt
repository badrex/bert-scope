tldr: This article discusses various approximate methods used in geophysics to analyze inverse problems. It focuses on the Backus-Gilbert method, which constructs a linear combination of kernels to infer parameters from measured values. The author provides some remarks on the amount of information given by these methods and the consequences of non-linearity in inverse problems. The article also presents approximate formulae for Backus-Gilbert averaging kernels and integral equations to derive them from Dirichlet kernels.
