revised_title: 'Investigating the Role of Peroxides in Engine Knock and Hydrocarbon Combustion'
semantic_tags:
  - Engine knock
  - Hydrocarbon combustion
  - Peroxides
  - Aldehyde reactions
  - Catalysis
tldr: This article investigates the connection between engine knock and the presence of peroxide substances formed during the combustion of hydrocarbons. The authors find that peroxides from aldehyde reactions are not the main cause of engine knock, and suggest that catalysis at the exhaust valve plays a significant role in the process.
