tldr: This study investigates the luminescence properties of thallium-activated potassium chloride (KCl) phosphors. The authors found that the phosphors emit light when exposed to X-rays and that the luminescence intensity is affected by the concentration of thallium ions. The research provides insights into the potential applications of these phosphors in various fields, such as scintillation detectors and lighting.
