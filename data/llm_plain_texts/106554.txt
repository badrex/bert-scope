tldr: This article outlines the procedures and penalties for ejecting fellows from the Royal Society who disobey its statutes, defame the society, or cause damage to it. The President proposes the ejection, and if two-thirds of the members vote in favor, the fellow is removed from the society and their name is recorded in the journal-book.
