tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the interactions and coalescence of water drops falling through the air. They focused on understanding the critical conditions for coalesced drops to separate or remain united. The coalescence efficiency was measured as a function of drop size, relative velocity, and charges. The results were supported by a theoretical framework, with implications for meteorological and atmospheric science.
