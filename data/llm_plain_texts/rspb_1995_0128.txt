tldr: This study investigates the tissue distribution and cellular localization of the SALMFamide neuropeptides S1 and S2 in the starfish Asterias rubens. Using novel monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, the researchers found that S2 is widely distributed in the radial nerve cord and tube foot ectoneural nerve plexus. Double labeling revealed a predominantly separate localization for S1 and S2 immunoreactivity. The potential functional roles of these neuropeptides in the starfish's radial nerve cord and tube feet are discussed.
