tldr: The study investigates the sedimentation rate of red blood cells in blood samples and how it is affected by plasma viscosity and agglutination. The authors found that the sedimentation rate can be used as a clinical index for certain diseases and that the kinematic viscosity of the plasma can be measured to determine the agglutination pattern. They also concluded that variations in plasma specific gravity and red cell specific gravity are negligible in the experiments performed.
