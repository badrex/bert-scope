tldr: The chemiluminescent reaction between sulphur monoxide (SO) and ozone has been studied in a fast flow system at pressures between 0 and 1 mmHg. The reaction is a rapid bimolecular process yielding electronically excited molecules in the first (triplet) and second (singlet) excited states. The intensity of the emission obeys a relationship similar to equation (i). The formation of electronically excited molecules in this reaction requires a higher activation energy than the formation of ground state molecules.
