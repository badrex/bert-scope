tldr: This article discusses the interaction between penicillin and penicillin-sensitive enzymes (PSEs) involved in bacterial cell wall synthesis. Penicillin binds to the enzyme's active site, inhibiting its activity and preventing the formation of cross-linkages in the bacterial cell wall. The article explores the different types of PSEs, their reactions, and the mechanisms of penicillin action on these enzymes.
