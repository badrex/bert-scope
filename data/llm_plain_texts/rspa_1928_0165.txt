tldr: This article investigates the effects of hydrogen and steam on the combustion of carbon monoxide-air mixtures at high pressures. The authors found that hydrogen has a more significant influence on accelerating the rise of pressure than steam. They also discovered that carbon monoxide can be directly oxidized without the intervention of steam at high initial pressures.
