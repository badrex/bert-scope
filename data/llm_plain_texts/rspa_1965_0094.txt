tldr: This article discusses the fracture characteristics of heavy-walled pressure vessels and the crack toughness required for their safe operation. It explores the use of small specimen tests to model crack extension behavior in full-scale vessels and the factors affecting crack toughness, such as stress, sharpness of the crack border, test temperature, and loading speed. The article also presents a 'leak-before-break' concept as a formal procedure for estimating the required crack toughness and discusses the application of this criterion to embrittlement due to radiation.
