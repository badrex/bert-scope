tldr: A young man named William Colebrook was left alone on a vessel and fell asleep in a cabin with residual sea-coal smoke. He became stupified and was brought to Dr. Frewen, who suspected the cause was the smoke. After recommending cold bath immersion, the patient gradually recovered, regaining consciousness and mobility. The case study highlights the dangers of inhaling sea-coal smoke and the effectiveness of cold bath immersion as a treatment.
