tldr: This study investigates the record of atmospheric deposition in rainwater-dependent peatlands, which provide a unique record of both particulate and soluble influxes without the complications of catchment processes. The research explores timescales, retention efficiency, and the best ways to present results, providing insights into the history of atmospheric contamination and its impact on peatlands.
