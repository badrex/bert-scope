tldr: The author presents a method for classifying and enumerating polyhedra based on their symmetry and configuration. The approach involves analyzing the polyhedra's faces, edges, and axes, and creating tables to track their properties. This method allows for the classification and enumeration of various types of polyhedra, including those with zonal and zoneless symmetry.
