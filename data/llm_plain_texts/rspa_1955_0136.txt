tldr: This article explores the significance of reactions with low activation energies in the mechanism of combustion. The author suggests that these reactions, such as chain-branching radical reactions, have a more rapid rate of increase with temperature compared to reactions between whole molecules. This can lead to a build-up of active centers during the temperature rise in the pre-ignition zone of a flame front, making them important in understanding combustion processes.
