tldr: 'Caroline Herschel, a pioneering astronomer, discovered a new comet in Germany while searching for celestial objects near the sun. She observed the comet's position and motion, making drawings and comparing them with nearby stars. Although she faced challenges due to hazy conditions, she was confident in her findings and requested the information be shared with her brother's astronomical friends.'
