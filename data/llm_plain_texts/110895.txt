tldr: Colonel Bainbridge invented a protracting pocket sextant for military purposes. This instrument allows for quick and accurate angle measurements, which can be directly recorded on paper for creating sketches and surveys. The device is particularly useful for fieldwork and expeditions, as it combines the functions of a sextant and a protractor.
