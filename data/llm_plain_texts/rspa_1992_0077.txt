tldr: The author investigates the forces on a finite body in an incompressible viscous flow, showing that potential flow and fluid elements of non-zero vorticity contribute to these forces. The study considers a solid body moving through a fluid, fluid accelerating past a solid body, and a solid body oscillating in a uniform stream. The analysis provides insights into the source elements of lift and drag forces and can potentially aid in understanding unsteady flow and flow with mild or large separation.
