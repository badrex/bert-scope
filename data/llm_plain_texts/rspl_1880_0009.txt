tldr: The authors study the process of ossification in the terminal phalanges of digits in various vertebrates. They find that the ossification process in ungual phalanges starts at the distal extremity and spreads towards the base, unlike other long bones. This process involves cartilage calcification, growth of subperiosteal intramembranous bone, and deposition of true bone along the line of osteoblastic ingrowth. The authors also observe that the distal extremity of the ungual phalanx corresponds morphologically to the center of the diaphysis in other long bones.
