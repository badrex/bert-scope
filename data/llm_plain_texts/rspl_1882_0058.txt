tldr: In 1882, William Huggins developed a method to photograph the solar corona without an eclipse using a reflecting telescope and photographic plates. By using absorptive media and controlling exposure times, Huggins captured images of the corona, revealing its complex form and details. His innovative technique paved the way for further studies of the solar corona and its relationship with terrestrial magnetic phenomena.
