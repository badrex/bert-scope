tldr: The author investigates the nature of salts called triple prussiates and their associated acids. They propose that these salts are binary compounds of an acid with a single base and do not contain Prussic acid or iron oxide as a base. The author also discovers new acids associated with triple prussiates and suggests new nomenclature for these compounds.
