tldr: The author conducted experiments on animals to study the consequences of experimental lesions on the cerebellum. They used the Marchi method to trace the degeneration of nerve fibers and found significant differences in the results compared to previous studies. The author observed extensive degeneration in the peduncles of the cerebellum and discussed the implications of these findings on the connections and functions of the cerebellum.
