tldr: The author conducted experiments to compare the spectra of lead isotopes, specifically lead from Australian Carnotite and ordinary lead. They discovered that the wave-length differences between the isotopes were significant, with the lead from Carnotite having a larger difference. This research highlights the importance of the chemical composition of a combustible gas and its economic value.
