tldr: In 1686, Mr. Cassini discovered two new satellites of Saturn using powerful telescopes at the Royal Observatory in Paris. The satellites were challenging to observe due to their small size and great distance from Earth. The discovery of these satellites helped establish the harmony of planetary systems and advanced our understanding of celestial mechanics.
