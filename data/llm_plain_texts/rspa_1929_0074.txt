tldr: This article discusses the structure of atomic nuclei, focusing on isotopes, protons, and nuclear disintegration. The authors present evidence for the isotopic constitution of elements, the role of protons in nuclear structure, and the artificial disintegration of elements through bombardment with alpha particles. They also explore the dimensions of the nucleus and the forces at play in its vicinity, as well as the scattering of alpha particles and the abnormal forces surrounding hydrogen and helium nuclei.
