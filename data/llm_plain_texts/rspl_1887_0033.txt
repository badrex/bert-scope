tldr: The author, Captain W. de W. Abney, studied the transmission of sunlight through Earth's atmosphere and its effects on photographic sensitivity. He found that the atmosphere's absorption and scattering properties can be accurately measured and calculated using a logarithmic formula. The author also discussed the suitability of high altitudes for observing different wavelengths of light, particularly in the visible spectrum, and the impact of atmospheric particles on light scattering.
