tldr: The authors investigate the decay of averaged single-channel NMDA receptor activations at low agonist concentrations. They find that the decay is mainly fast, with a time constant of around 5 ms. The study helps to understand the timecourse of the response and its relation to single-channel activations, contributing to the knowledge of NMDA receptor function and its role in synaptic transmission.
