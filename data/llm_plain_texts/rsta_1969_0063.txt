tldr: This study presents experimental results from a radio echo sounding traverse over the ice sheet of northwestern Greenland in 1964. The authors discuss the theoretical problems of radio wave propagation in an ice sheet and the factors affecting accuracy. They find that the radio echo technique is effective in obtaining echoes over vast areas of ice sheets, with temperature and impurity content of ice being the main variables affecting field performance. The study also reveals that local surface slopes on the ice sheet are largely controlled by variations of longitudinal stress along the line of flow, while regional slopes over several kilometers vary with the velocity of ice movement.
