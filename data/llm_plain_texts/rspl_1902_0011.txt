tldr: This article examines the development of the retina layers in chick embryos, focusing on the structure and function of various cell types. The author describes the formation of the internal and external molecular layers, the role of myelospongium fibres, and the differentiation of rod and cone cells. The study also explores the relationship between the retina and the ciliated epithelium of the cerebral ventricles, suggesting they are homologous structures.
