tldr: This study investigates the sedimentation equilibrium of critically branched polycondensates using ultracentrifugation. The authors conducted experiments on 2-butanone solutions of standard polystyrene and polycondensates near the gel point of decamethylene glycol and benzene 1,3,5-triacetic acid. They developed two methods to eliminate the dependence of rotor speed on the apparent molecular mass, allowing them to determine the molecular mass distribution and thermodynamic properties of the polycondensates.
