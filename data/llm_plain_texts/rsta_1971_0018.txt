tldr: This article discusses a regional study of the geology of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at 45°N, focusing on the petrology of submarine volcanics from the NE Pacific. The authors describe the various rock types found in the area, including basalts, serpentinized mafic and ultramafic rocks, and metamorphic rocks. They also discuss the possible existence of block faulting and the distribution of erratics in the area, as well as the implications of their findings for understanding ocean-floor spreading and the age of the Median Valley.
