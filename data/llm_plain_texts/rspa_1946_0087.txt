tldr: This study presents an experimental apparatus designed to investigate the kinetic friction between two surfaces in the presence of a lubricant, focusing on boundary and mixed lubrication conditions. The authors describe the principles and design of the apparatus, as well as the methods used to obtain relatively pure boundary friction. They discuss the importance of studying frictional phenomena under boundary conditions and compare the boundary frictional properties of different combinations of surfaces and lubricants.
