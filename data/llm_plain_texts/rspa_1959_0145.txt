tldr: The authors conducted a study on the elastic scattering of neutrons by deuterons, taking into account polarization effects. They used the Kohn variational method and evaluated phases on DEUCE. The results showed that polarization effects were negligible in this approximation. This research contributes to understanding nuclear forces and low-energy neutron-deuteron scattering.
