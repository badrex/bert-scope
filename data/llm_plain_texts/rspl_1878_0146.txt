tldr: The author investigates the influence of electricity on colliding water drops in a jet. They discover that under moderate electrical influence, the jet appears coherent, while more powerful electrical action causes the scattering to increase. The author explains that the scattering is due to the rebound of drops when they collide, and that under electrical influence, the drops no longer rebound, making the jet appear coherent. The author also demonstrates that the phenomenon is not due to differences in electrification but rather the small electric forces acting on the drops.
