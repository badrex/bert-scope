tldr: The study discusses the evolution of a two-dimensional wavepacket in a growing boundary layer using linear stability theory. The wavepacket is represented by an integral of periodic wavetrains, and the authors analyze the effects of boundary layer growth and nonlinearities on the behavior of the wavepacket. The research aims to provide a better understanding of the transition process from laminar to turbulent flow.
