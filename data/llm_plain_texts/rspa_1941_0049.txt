revised_title: Bose-Einstein Statistics and Degeneracy: Applications to Liquid Helium
semantic_tags:
  - Statistical mechanics
  - Quantum statistics
  - Bose-Einstein condensation
  - Degenerate gases
  - Liquid helium
tldr: The authors explore the thermodynamic properties of degenerate and non-degenerate Bose-Einstein gases, focusing on the completely non-relativistic and completely relativistic cases. They discuss the connection between black-body radiation and the relativistic Bose-Einstein degenerate case and the possibility of non-degenerate radiation. The study has implications for understanding liquid helium and its potential applications.
