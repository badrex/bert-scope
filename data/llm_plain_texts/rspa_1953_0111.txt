tldr: The author presents a new method for deriving perturbation theory formulae in quantum mechanics using elementary algebra. This approach solves the Schrödinger equation by expressing the perturbation energy in powers of the perturbation, providing a straightforward derivation of the older and recent perturbation expansions. The method is demonstrated for time-independent and time-dependent Hamiltonians, and the results are compared with the interaction representation.
