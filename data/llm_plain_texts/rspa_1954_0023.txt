tldr: The authors studied the properties of slow particles produced in nuclear disintegration events. They analyzed the mass and decay products of these particles, finding evidence for two types of slow particles: K-mesons and pi-mesons. The authors also discussed the frequency of slow particle observation, the energy released in these events, and the conditions under which slow ejected particles can be observed. Their findings contribute to a better understanding of particle physics and nuclear interactions.
