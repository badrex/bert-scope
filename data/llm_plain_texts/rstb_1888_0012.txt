tldr: The author conducted experiments on the electrical organ of Torpedo marmorata to study its electromotive properties. They discovered that the organ responds to the passage of an induction shock, regardless of its direction, and that the irreciprocal galvanometric effect is due to the organ's response affecting the instrument. This finding clarifies the nature of excitatory phenomena in the organ and challenges previous assumptions about irreciprocal conduction.
