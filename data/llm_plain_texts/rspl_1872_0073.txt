tldr: The author, William Henry Flower, describes the complete adult dentition of a new genus of extinct mammal, Homalodotherium Cunninghami, discovered in South Patagonia. The animal had a typical number of teeth and presented a gradual transition in characters in both jaws. Its molars resemble those of the Rhinoceros, making it a generalized type of Perissodactyle Ungulate, allied to Rhinoceros, Macrauchenia, Nesodon, and Toxodon.
