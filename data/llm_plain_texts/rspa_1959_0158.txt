revised_title: 'Equilibrium Theory and Perturbation Solutions for Exchange Processes in Fixed Columns'
semantic_tags:
  - Exchange processes
  - Fixed columns
  - Equilibrium theory
  - Perturbation solutions
  - Kinetic theory
tldr: The authors develop the equilibrium theory and perturbation solutions for exchange processes in fixed columns, connecting them with kinetic theory solutions. They find that the equilibrium theory's solution is equal to the value obtained from the kinetic theory, providing a better understanding of exchange processes in fixed columns.
