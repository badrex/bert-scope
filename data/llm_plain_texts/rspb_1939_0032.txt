tldr: Researchers conducted experiments on Drosophila to study pre-imaginal olfactory conditioning in insects. They found that when larvae were raised on a culture medium containing peppermint essence, the adult flies showed a positive conditioned response to the odor. This demonstrated that conditioning can occur during the pre-imaginal stage, suggesting that the influence of the environment during this period plays a role in the insects' behavior.
