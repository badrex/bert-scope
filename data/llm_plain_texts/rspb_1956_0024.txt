tldr: This study investigates how passive immunity is transmitted from mother to fetus in rats. The researchers found that maternal antibodies can enter the fetus's circulation through the yolk sac and amniotic fluids. They also discovered that antibodies can be absorbed from the gut of the fetus and appear in the circulation. This knowledge helps understand the transfer of immunity from mother to offspring and its implications in rat development.
