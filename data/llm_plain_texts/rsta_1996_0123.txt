tldr: This article discusses the use of multi-imaging techniques and multivariate statistics for 3D characterization of electronic materials. The authors describe various imaging methods, such as energy dispersive X-ray detection, parallel electron energy loss spectroscopy, secondary ion mass spectroscopy, and scanning Auger microscopy, which produce complex data structures that require special methodologies for effective interpretation. The article outlines the application of scatter diagrams, interactive correlation partitioning, factor and target factor analysis, and principal component analysis to semiconducting, catalytic, and magnetic structures, and introduces the concept of surface chemometrics.
