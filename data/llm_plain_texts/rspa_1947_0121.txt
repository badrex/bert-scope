tldr: This study investigates the surface impedance of superconductors and normal metals at high frequencies, focusing on the resistance of superconducting tin and mercury at 1200 Mcyc./sec. The research employs a resonator measurement technique to analyze the electrical impedance of metals at low temperatures and high frequencies. The results show that a finite resistance is present in superconductors at all temperatures, tending towards a very low value as the absolute zero is approached. The findings confirm London's observation that the r.f. resistance of normal tin above the transition point is much greater than predicted by the classical skin-effect theory.
