revised_title: Cyclonic Motion and the Role of Revolving Fluid in Atmospheric Phenomena
semantic_tags:
  - Meteorology

  - Fluid Dynamics
  - Atmospheric Pressure
tldr: The author examines the concept of revolving fluid in the atmosphere and its relation to cyclones and anticyclones. They argue that the motion of air in cyclones is not the motion of revolving fluid in the special sense referred to, and that cyclonic motion is not a symmetrical motion around a center. The author also discusses the dynamics of cyclonic depressions and the balance of pressure and wind velocity in cyclones.
