tldr: The authors examine the applicability of the Born model for ions in aqueous solutions, focusing on free energy and entropy expressions. They find that the model is valid as a first approximation but that deviations are significant, especially for ions with high charge and small radius. The authors apply modern theories of the dielectric constant of water to provide a higher-approximation treatment, improving the interpretation of experimental free energies and entropies.
