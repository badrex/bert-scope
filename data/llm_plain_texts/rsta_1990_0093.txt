tldr: This article reviews the Mesozoic-Cenozoic tectonic evolution of the Anatolian orogenic belt, focusing on three regions: the Sakarya continent, the Central Pontides, and the southeast Anatolian region. The study emphasizes the geological history of these areas, which are critical in evaluating the consecutive stages of the orogeny through time. The tectono-stratigraphic units and their corresponding tectonic events are discussed, highlighting the role of the Palaeo-Tethyan and Neo-Tethyan systems in the region's evolution.
