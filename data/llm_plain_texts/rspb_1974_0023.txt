tldr: The author investigates the fixation of nucleic acids by leaf fibre and calcium phosphate. They find that calcium phosphate co-precipitates half its mass of ribonucleic acids from yeast, tobacco leaf, and tobacco mosaic virus when the precipitate is formed in their presence. Autolytic changes in leaf fibre and calcium-chelators in leaf extracts explain the differences in the amount of nucleic acid present in extracts made from tobacco leaves in different ways. This research has implications for understanding the movement and location of RNA within a tissue and its role in virus infections.
