tldr: This article analyzes the atomic explosion of 1945, focusing on the formation of a blast wave and the energy released. The author, Sir Geoffrey Taylor, uses photographs and theoretical calculations to estimate the energy generated in the explosion, finding it equivalent to 16,800 tons of T.N.T. The study also discusses the dynamics of the explosion, including pressure, temperature, and air density changes.
