tldr: The author describes a new and improved method for verifying thermometers at the Kew Observatory, which uses a more substantial and efficient apparatus. The new system allows for faster and more accurate temperature comparisons, reducing the chance of errors due to variations in the rate of cooling. This method has been in use for two years and has proven to be quite satisfactory.
