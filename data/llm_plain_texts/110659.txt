tldr: Thomas Maclear conducted observations at the Cape of Good Hope to verify the amplitude of Abbe de la Caille's meridian using Bradley's Zenith Sector. He described the process of assembling and setting up the sector, as well as the challenges faced during the observations. Although the anomaly of La Caille's arc was not entirely resolved, Maclear acknowledged the great credit due to the distinguished astronomer for his work with limited resources.
