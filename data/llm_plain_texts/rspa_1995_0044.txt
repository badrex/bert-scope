tldr: The authors explore the effects of atomic vibrations and correlations on incoherent imaging of crystals using thermally scattered electrons. They develop an approximate intensity expression to describe atomic-resolution contrast imaging, considering the role of atomic vibrations and the localization of scattering events within the crystal. The study aims to understand the degree to which phonons break coherence along an atomic column and evaluate their impact on imaging techniques.
