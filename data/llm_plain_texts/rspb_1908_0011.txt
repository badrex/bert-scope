tldr: The author conducted breeding experiments with rats to study the hereditary transmission of coat colors. They found that Mendel's principles can explain the observed facts, and the phenomena can be explained by segregation, gametic purity, and dominance. The study confirms previous conclusions on coat color inheritance in rats and adds new results to the understanding of the topic.
