tldr: The authors study the probability of existence of Nash equilibria for a certain class of random matrices. They calculate the probability that a line through the origin pierces the cone generated by vectors chosen with a centrally symmetric distribution, and use this to derive the probability of the existence of a Nash equilibrium for a random pay-off matrix. The results have implications in the context of evolution and game theory.
