tldr: The authors analyze the elemental compositions of terrestrial igneous rocks, focusing on elements that partition strongly into liquids in mafic and ultramafic systems. They propose a model for mantle circulation and magma genesis, suggesting that the extent of mantle fusion during magma genesis is very small, with melt fractions ranging from a few percent to less than 1%. This model helps explain the elemental and isotopic diversity of terrestrial igneous rocks.
