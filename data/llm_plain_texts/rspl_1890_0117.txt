tldr: This article discusses the methods and findings of cloud photography conducted at Kew Observatory under the Meteorological Council. The authors describe the construction of cameras with theodolite mountings and the development of a suitable photographic process to capture cloud images. They also explain the process of determining cloud height and motion using simultaneous exposures of two cameras. The main goal of the study is to determine the velocity of cloud movement at different heights above the Earth's surface.
