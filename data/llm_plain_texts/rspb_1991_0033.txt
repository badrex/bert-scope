tldr: This article discusses the various strategies used by allopolyploid plants to achieve diploidization during meiosis. It explores the different ways in which bivalent formation occurs, including homologous synapsis only, homoeologous pairing at zygotene and pachytene, and the elimination of multivalents. The article highlights the importance of understanding these strategies for plant breeding and evolution.
