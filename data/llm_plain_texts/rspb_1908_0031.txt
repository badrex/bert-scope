tldr: The authors studied the enzyme action of emulsin and its role in the hydrolysis of amygdalin and glucose. They discovered that emulsin contains multiple enzymes, including gluco-lactase, β-glucase, and amygdalase. The study also highlights the importance of enzymes as diagnostic agents and the challenges in separating and purifying enzyme products.
