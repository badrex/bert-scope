tldr: The authors conducted a survey of anthocyanins in 246 tropical plants from Trinidad, using paper chromatographic methods. They found that the complexity of glycosidic combinations is much greater than previously assumed, and the hypothesis of a high pelargonidin frequency among tropical plants was not confirmed. The study also showed a strong correlation between anthocyanidin types and flower colors, with cyanidin pigments producing a wide range of colors.
