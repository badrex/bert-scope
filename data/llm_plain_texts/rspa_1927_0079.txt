tldr: This article investigates the thermal changes and magnetic properties of low-carbon iron-manganese alloys. The author found that these alloys are less affected by heating and quenching compared to manganese steel. The magnetic properties of these alloys are influenced by the proportion of carbon present, and alloys with high manganese percentages are non-magnetic. The research also establishes a difference in metallurgical character between iron-manganese and iron-nickel alloys.
