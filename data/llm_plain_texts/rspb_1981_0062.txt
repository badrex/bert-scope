tldr: The study measures the sizes of motoneurons supplying hindlimb muscles in mice using retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase. The results show a bimodal distribution of motoneuron sizes, with smaller neurons (gamma motoneurons) and larger neurons (alpha motoneurons) in all motonuclei except for the foot musculature. The study provides insights into the morphology and function of different types of motoneurons in the mouse spinal cord.
