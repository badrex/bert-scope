tldr: This article investigates the antibacterial activity of various penicillin derivatives, specifically the nature of their activity against different acyl derivatives of 6-aminopenicillanic acid. The study found that the differences in activity between penicillins are due to differences in affinity between the antibiotic and the bacterial cell, rather than differences in the function of the drug once it reaches the site of action. The research also suggests that the sensitivity of bacteria to penicillin is a function of the affinity between the penicillin molecule and a component of the bacterial cell.
