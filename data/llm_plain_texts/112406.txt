tldr: This article discusses the behavior of thermometers in vacuum conditions and the effects of atmospheric pressure on their readings. The author conducted experiments to determine the accuracy of vacuum corrections in pendulum experiments and found that the effects of exhaustion on thermometers were not always permanent. The author also investigated the role of time and other factors in the accuracy of thermometer readings in vacuum conditions.
