tldr: The author, Smithson Tennant, discovered two new metals in the black powder remaining after the solution of platina. One of these metals, osmium, was given its name due to its strong smell. The author described its properties and how it can be separated from other elements. Osmium is notable for its ability to form alloys with other metals and its characteristic purple-blue color when mixed with galls.
