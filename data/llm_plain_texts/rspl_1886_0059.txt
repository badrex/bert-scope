tldr: The author presents a general theorem in electrostatic induction, demonstrating that when a dielectric is brought into an electric field and its specific inductive capacity is altered, the dielectric becomes electrified. This theorem sheds light on fundamental electrical phenomena and provides insight into the process of electrification by friction.
