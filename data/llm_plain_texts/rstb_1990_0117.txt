tldr: The article discusses the early Middle Pleistocene vertebrate fauna and climate of Little Oakley, Essex, based on fossils found in a channel deposit. The fauna consists of mammals, fish, and herpetofauna, indicating a temperate climate and vegetation. The findings support an age for the channel later than the Pastonian but predating faunas 2 and 3 of Westbury-sub-Mendip.
