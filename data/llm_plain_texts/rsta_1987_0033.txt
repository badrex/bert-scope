tldr: This article argues that probabilistic support is not inductive support. The authors demonstrate that every increase in probability has to be attributed to deductive connections between the hypothesis and the evidence. They also discuss the relationship between probabilistic dependence and deductive dependence, emphasizing that the extent of deductive dependence between two propositions is determined by how much of the other each of them implies.
