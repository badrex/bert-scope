tldr: This article discusses the synthesis and reactivity of carbidocarbonyl clusters of iron, focusing on the unique chemistry of the cluster-bound carbon atom. The authors describe the formation of these clusters, their structural features, and the reactivity of the carbon atom when exposed in an open, butterfly geometry. The article highlights the potential relevance of these clusters to the chemistry of surface-bound carbon atoms in heterogeneous catalysis.
