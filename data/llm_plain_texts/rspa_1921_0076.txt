tldr: The author discusses the geological effects of the cooling of the Earth, focusing on the role of thermal contraction in the formation of mountains. They argue that the cooling and solidification of the Earth's crust led to horizontal compression, which caused the formation of mountain ranges. The author also considers the differences in rock types and their properties, suggesting that basic rocks are stronger than acidic ones, which may contribute to the formation of specific types of mountain ranges.
