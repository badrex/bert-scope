tldr: The author, A.W. Hofmann, conducted research on the poly-ammonias, specifically focusing on the derivatives of phenylamine and ethylamine. He discovered new compounds through various chemical reactions, including the action of dibromide of ethylene on phenylamine and ethylamine. The study of these reactions and the resulting compounds provides insight into the nature of substances generated from primary aromatic monamines and monamines containing an ordinary alcohol radical.
