tldr: The author investigates the differential equations that the polarisation-vector of a stream of light has to satisfy in various media, including isotropic and crystalline media. They also explore the boundary conditions at the interface of different media and the connection between Fresnel's theory and electromagnetic theory for crystalline media. The study provides a foundation for understanding light propagation in various materials and the behavior of polarized light.
