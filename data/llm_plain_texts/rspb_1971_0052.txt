tldr: This study investigates the effects of stationary retinal patterns on the behavior of neurons in the cat's visual cortex. The results show that stationary patterns rarely change the spontaneous activity of visual units but consistently alter the response of neurons to a neighboring mobile pattern. This finding suggests that steady retinal illumination reaches the cerebral cortex and can modify neuronal responses to more powerful stimuli.
