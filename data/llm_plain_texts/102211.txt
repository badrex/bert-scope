tldr: Martin Lister conducted an experiment to determine if the chyle in the lacteal veins could be altered by injecting a tincture of indigo into a dog's digestive system. The experiment showed that the lacteal veins received the indigo-colored chyle from within the intestines, proving that the veins carry substances from the digestive system.
