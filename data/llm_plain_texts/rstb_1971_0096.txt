tldr: The article discusses the initiation of salt and water transport in mammalian salivary glands by acetylcholine. The author explains how acetylcholine increases the membrane potential of acinar cells, leading to an enhanced intracellular sodium concentration. This increased sodium concentration either directly activates a sodium chloride pump or indirectly activates the secretory mechanism by increasing calcium influx. The study investigates the potassium transport in the cat submandibular gland and the role of the sodium-potassium pump in the process.
