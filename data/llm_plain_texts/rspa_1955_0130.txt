tldr: The authors propose a semi-classical approach to the meson theory and nuclear matter, suggesting that a mesic fluid forms a fluid in which nucleons are free to move. They analyze the transformation of the symmetric pseudo-scalar meson theory to reveal saturation properties and discuss the use of a self-consistent field in nuclear structure. The authors also consider residual interparticle forces within the nucleus and electromagnetic interactions.
