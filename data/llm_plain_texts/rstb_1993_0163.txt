tldr: The author proposes the protected invasion hypothesis, which suggests that dominant alleles for maternal care in haplodiploid populations are more resistant to loss from genetic drift than paternal-care alleles. This hypothesis explains the association between haplodiploid Hymenoptera and eusociality, female workers, and the absence of male parental and alloparental care. The hypothesis is distinct from kin selection theory and provides a more comprehensive explanation for the social structures of Hymenoptera.
