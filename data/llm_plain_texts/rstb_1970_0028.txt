tldr: The author revisits the classification and early evolution of the Jurassic reptile Hallopus victor, providing a consistent explanation of its unique skeletal features as a variant on the basic crocodilian plan. The study also discusses the relationships of early crocodilomorphs and proposes a new suborder, Paracrocodylia, for cursorial forms like Hallopus. The research suggests that Hallopus had a hare-like bounding gallop as its primary mode of fast locomotion.
