tldr: This study examines the sorption properties of decationated zeolites, specifically hydrogen-chabazite, focusing on gases such as nitrogen, argon, krypton, and xenon. The authors analyze the isotherms and determine equilibrium constants, standard heats, entropies, and free energies of transfer for the gases. They also discuss the energetic basis of the sorption behavior and the role of cations in the process.
