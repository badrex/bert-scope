tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the impact sensitivity of solid high explosives, focusing on the time intervals between impact and explosion. They discovered that the formation of hot spots is a prime factor in the initiation of high explosives by impact. The presence of foreign substances, such as quartz, can increase the impact sensitivity of explosives, while soft materials like beeswax can decrease it. The authors also observed that the impact-rebound time increases when a thin layer of material is present between the hammer and anvil.
