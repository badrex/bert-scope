tldr: This article investigates the effect of a periodically varying crystal growth rate on the Czochralski crystal growth system, specifically when the crystal melts back due to a large amplitude harmonic component. The study focuses on the role of solid solute diffusion in the formation of a boundary layer adjacent to the crystal interface, which has different structures during various phases of the cycle. The results of numerical calculations are presented, providing insights into the behavior of the system under these conditions.
