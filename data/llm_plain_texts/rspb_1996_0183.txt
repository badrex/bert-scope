tldr: Researchers have developed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to identify and track female chromosomes in cockerel ejaculates. This technique allows them to study the fate of female cells in male germline chimaeras and understand the process of sex determination in birds. The PCR assay amplifies a specific region of the W chromosome, enabling the detection of female DNA in male samples.
