tldr: The authors conducted experiments to separate and study the properties of helium gas. They discovered that helium can be separated from other gases using platinum electrodes and that it undergoes color changes when absorbed by platinum. The process of absorption also allows for the separation of other gases like hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon compounds. The authors also found that argon can be separated from helium using this method.
