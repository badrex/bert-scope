tldr: The author conducted experiments with various metals and electrolytes to create new compounds called Electro-Nitrogurets. They discovered that by using oxidable metals at the anode and nascent hydrogen and nitrogen at the cathode, they could form permanent compounds with nitrogen. The author also mentioned a similar deposit observed by Mr. Daniell, which they believed to be worthy of further investigation.
