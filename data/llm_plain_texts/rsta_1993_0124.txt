tldr: The authors characterized a refolding intermediate of ribonuclease S using various spectroscopic techniques, revealing significant amounts of secondary and tertiary structure. The intermediate is packed and native-like but differs from a molten globule in having no near-UV CD spectrum. The final refolding step is slow and involves proline isomerization.
