tldr: The author, William Marsden, discovered an error in his previous work on the chronology of the HINDOOS era. He found that he had calculated the elapsed time one year short and corrected the year 1847 to 1846, which corresponds to the year 1790. The corrected information should be noted and included in the current volume of the Transactions.
