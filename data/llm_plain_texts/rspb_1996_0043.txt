tldr: This study investigates violent interactions between bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises in the Moray Firth, Scotland. The majority of stranded harbour porpoises exhibited multiple internal injuries, characterized by extensive bruising and haemorrhage. The spacing between the skin cuts on the porpoises matched the spacing between the teeth of bottlenose dolphins, suggesting that dolphins were responsible for the injuries. Four instances of dolphin-porpoise interactions were witnessed, with the porpoises appearing to be the victims. These findings challenge the benign image of bottlenose dolphins and provide a previously undocumented cause of mortality in porpoises.
