tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the recovery of visual sensitivity after exposure to light. They found that the reciprocity law, widely valid in photographic processes, only holds under specific circumstances for visual phenomena. The study provides insights into the photochemical reactions in the retina and the recovery process of the eye after exposure to light.
