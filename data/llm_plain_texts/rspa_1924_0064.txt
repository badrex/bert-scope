tldr: This article investigates the drift and yaw of spinning projectiles in ballistics. The author presents an analytical investigation of the forces acting on a spinning projectile during its flight and derives formulas for drift, cross-range wind deflection, and the vertical and lateral components of yaw. The findings are compared to experimental results and show that the formulas are practically identical, despite using different mathematical theories.
