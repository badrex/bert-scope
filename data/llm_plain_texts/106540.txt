tldr: The author, William Wales, explores the use of tables of natural and logarithmic sines, tangents, and secants in resolving affected equations. He demonstrates a new method for resolving equations, which can be applied to various fields such as geometry, astronomy, and optics. This method offers advantages over traditional algebraic methods, making it easier and faster to find the value of unknown quantities in equations.
