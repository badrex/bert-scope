tldr: This study analyzes the effect of pastoral management on the carrying capacity of African savanna ecosystems, focusing on the biomass of large ungulates. The research controls for variations in net primary production by considering rainfall and soil nutrient availability. The results show that rainfall and soil nutrient levels significantly affect ungulate biomass, with high nutrient availability leading to a 20 times greater biomass compared to low nutrient availability. The study concludes that extensive pastoral management does not increase carrying capacity above that observed in natural communities, and that carrying capacity is limited at the community level rather than the species level.
