tldr: 'In this letter, Patrick Blair describes the discovery of asbestos in the Highlands of Scotland. He explains that the stone has parallel fibers that can be separated and spun into a fine thread, which could be used to make an incombustible cloth. Blair also mentions a reddish substance found in the area, which could potentially be used for dyeing. The quarry contains asbestos of different colors, with the bluish one being coarser and the white and red ones having a finer grain.'
