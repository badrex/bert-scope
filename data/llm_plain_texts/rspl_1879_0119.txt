tldr: This article discusses the phenomenon of thermal transpiration, a process in which gases flow through porous materials due to temperature differences. The author, O. Reynolds, compares his method of investigation with that of Professor Maxwell and provides a detailed analysis of the process, including the effects of different types of porous plates. The article also addresses the limitations of previous theories and offers a more comprehensive understanding of thermal transpiration.
