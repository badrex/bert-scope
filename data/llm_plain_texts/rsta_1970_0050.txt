tldr: This article presents a comprehensive study on the theory of multicomponent chromatography, focusing on the development of a rigorous mathematical framework for understanding complex separation processes. The authors discuss the ideal conditions for chromatographic systems, the role of adsorption isotherms, and the use of Riemann invariants and characteristic parameters in solving multicomponent chromatography problems. The study has significant implications for the optimization and improvement of chromatographic techniques in various fields, including chemical analysis, pharmaceuticals, and environmental science.
