tldr: The author proposes a method to measure light intensity using thermopiles and light filters to overcome the limitations of color vision in photometry. The suggested filter is made of aqueous solutions of copper acetate and potassium bichromate, which can accurately measure the energy of visible light while ignoring infra-red and ultra-violet radiation. This method aims to create a standard unit of light that can handle various light sources and illumination levels.
