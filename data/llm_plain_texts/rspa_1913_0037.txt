tldr: The author investigates the crystal growth and optical properties of ammonium ferrous sulphate, a mineral with monoclinic symmetry. They study its habit, angles, and etch-figures to understand its crystal structure and compare it with other alkali-metal salts. The author also examines the effect of replacing potassium with other elements on the crystal angles and discusses the specific gravities of these salts.
