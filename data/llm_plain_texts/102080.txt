tldr: This article discusses experiments conducted by the Philosophical Society of Oxford on digestion in fish, specifically focusing on the role of glands in the stomach. The authors observed a large bed of glands near the stomach's pylorus and suggested that these glands play a significant role in separating the digestive menstruum from the blood. They also noted the moist environment around the glands and the ability to dissolve bones in fish due to the presence of this menstruum. The authors argue against the existence of an acid ferment in the stomach, instead proposing that a volatile alcali is responsible for digestion.
