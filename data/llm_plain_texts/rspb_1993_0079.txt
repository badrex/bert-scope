tldr: 'This study investigates the changes in cell length and membrane voltage in single left ventricular myocytes from guinea-pigs with pressure-overload left ventricular hypertrophy. The results show that cell shortening is increased in the hypertrophy group, and the relation between cell shortening and membrane voltage is bell-shaped. The findings suggest that increased calcium entry via sarcolemmal sodium-calcium exchange may contribute to the differences in contraction in hypertrophy myocytes.'
