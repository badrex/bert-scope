tldr: The authors improve upon previous work in Waring's problem, focusing on the estimation of the contribution of major arcs in the efficient differencing process. They develop new pruning processes and replace certain smooth Weyl sums with classical Weyl sums, leading to improvements in Waring's problem for larger values. In this instance, they prove that all sufficiently large natural numbers can be represented as the sum of at most 42 eighth powers of integers, improving upon the previous bound of 1.
