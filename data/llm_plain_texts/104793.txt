tldr: Major William Cock invented a machine for sounding the sea at any depth or in any part in 1738. The machine consists of two pieces of iron that sink the trunk when the weight touches the ground, and then the iron pieces fall off, allowing the trunk to float or rise back to the surface. The machine can reach the bottom of the sea in one minute and three seconds, even when loaded with a 12-pound iron ball.
