tldr: This article investigates the electrical properties of sea-water under alternating current conditions, focusing on its conductivity and dielectric constant. The study finds that the conductivity is nearly independent of frequency, while the dielectric constant is negligible in comparison to the conductivity. The results help to understand the effect of sea-water on the propagation of radio waves.
