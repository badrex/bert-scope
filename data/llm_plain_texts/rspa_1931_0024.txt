tldr: The authors investigate the motion of homopolar molecules in crystals using the symmetric spherical oscillator model. They derive equations for eigenvalues and discuss the transition between rotational and oscillational motion. The study provides insights into the behavior of molecules in crystals and contributes to the understanding of quantum mechanics.
