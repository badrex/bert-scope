tldr: The author, William Rutherford, discovered an error in the value of the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter due to a transposition of figures in a recurring decimal. He extended his calculations to over 400 decimal places using Machin's formula and confirmed the accuracy of his result with the help of Mr. W. Shanks.
