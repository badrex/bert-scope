tldr: The authors investigated the irreversible formation of methane in the ethane-ethylene-hydrogen system. They found that methane is formed from the direct decomposition of ethane and from the reaction between ethylene and hydrogen. The rate of methane formation is less affected by nitric oxide, suggesting that the methane-forming reaction is different from normal chain reactions. The study provides insights into the theoretical understanding of methane production and its complex mechanisms.
