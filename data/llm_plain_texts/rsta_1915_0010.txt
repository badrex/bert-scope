tldr: The authors conducted experiments on gaseous combustion at high pressures using a specialized apparatus. They studied the behavior of methane, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide in explosive mixtures and determined the relative affinities of these gases for oxygen in flame combustion. The research provided insights into the mechanism of combustion of hydrogen and carbon monoxide and helped to understand the role of initial pressures in gaseous combustion.
