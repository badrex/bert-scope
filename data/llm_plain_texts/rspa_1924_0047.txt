tldr: The authors investigated the ultra-violet emission bands associated with oxygen and found that they do not match the absorption bands of ozone. They discovered that the main band system falls into nine series, which can be expressed by a Deslandres formula. This arrangement into series is similar to other well-known spectra, such as the 1st positive bands of nitrogen and the less refrangible spectrum of cyanogen.
