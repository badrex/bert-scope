tldr: This article presents observations of 380 double and triple stars made between 1821 and 1823 by John Frederick William Herschel and James South. The authors compared their findings with those of other astronomers and discussed changes observed in the stars since their initial discovery. They also described a five-feet equatorial instrument used in their observations, which contributed to the advancement of physical astronomy and the understanding of celestial mechanics.
