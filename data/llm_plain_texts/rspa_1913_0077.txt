tldr: This article discusses spectroscopic investigations of nitrogen-containing compounds, specifically silicon and titanium tetrachlorides. The authors discovered new bands in the spectrum of silicon tetrachloride, which they attributed to a nitride of silicon. They also found that titanium tetrachloride did not develop any bands that could be attributed to a nitride, suggesting that it behaves differently than silicon tetrachloride in the afterglow.
