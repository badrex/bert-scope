revised_title: 'Electrogenic Sodium Pump in Pancreatic Acinar Cells: A New Discovery'
semantic_tags:
  - Sodium pump
  - Pancreatic acinar cells
  - Electrochemistry
  - Membrane potential
  - Strophanthin-G
tldr: The authors discovered that pancreatic acinar cells have an electrogenic sodium pump that is dependent on the presence of extracellular potassium and sensitive to strophanthin-G. This finding indicates that the sodium pump plays a significant role in the membrane potential of these cells and contributes to their function.
