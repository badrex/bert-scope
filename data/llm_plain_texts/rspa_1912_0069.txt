tldr: This article investigates the existence and properties of borohydrates, compounds containing boron, hydrogen, and oxygen. The authors describe various experiments and reactions involving boron derivatives and their solutions, discussing the potential existence of hydroborons and the complexity of their structures. They also explore the reducing properties and color-changing behavior of these solutions, suggesting that the yellow color is due to colloidal boron.
