tldr: The authors present a technique for predicting the direction of sexual competition in species with complex mating patterns, based on three parameters: relative times out from reproductive activity for each sex, adult sex ratio, and the extent of collateral investment. This approach can help understand the dynamics of sexual selection and mating competition in various species.
