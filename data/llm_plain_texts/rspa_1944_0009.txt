tldr: The authors study the interaction between fibrous proteins and acids, focusing on the differences in titration curves between fibrous and soluble proteins. They explain that fibrous proteins can absorb a greater number of protons, leading to a higher positive potential and a steeper titration curve. The findings have implications for understanding the properties of fibrous proteins like wool keratin.
