tldr: This study investigates the structure and energy of periodic grain boundaries in aluminium using a combination of experimental observations and theoretical computations. The researchers found that specific rigid body translations and local atomic relaxation contribute to the formation of low-energy boundaries. The results provide insights into the factors that influence grain boundary structure and help to understand the physical properties of polycrystalline metals.
