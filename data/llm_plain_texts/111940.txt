tldr: The author, A.W. Hofmann, researched the formation and properties of tetrammonium-compounds, which are complex bases generated by the accumulation of ammonia molecules. They described the synthesis of these compounds through various chemical reactions, including the action of dibromide of ethylene on ethylene-diamine, and discussed their properties and applications.
