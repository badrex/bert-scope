tldr: The authors develop a new theory for unsteady flow through a cascade of aerofoils, which is essential for understanding the behavior of turbomachinery in real-world conditions. They focus on the pressure distribution, lift, and moment on an aerofoil in a cascade, and derive a simple formula for the growth of lift due to a sharpedged gust. This theory can be applied to various problems, including the transient loading on cascade blades and the stability of turbine and compressor blades.
