tldr: This article describes the discovery and analysis of a new species of Bennettites, a type of fossil plant, found in the Gault Formation of the British Cretaceous period. The author provides a detailed description of the structure and characteristics of the new species, including the shape and size of the seeds and the cone. The discovery of this new species sheds light on the structure and evolution of the Bennettitales, a group of plants that were rapidly declining during the Cretaceous period.
