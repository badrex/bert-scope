tldr: The article discusses the induction of transplantation tolerance in adult animals using antilymphocytic serum (ALS). The authors found that ALS treatment, followed by injections of lymphoid cells, allowed mice to accept A-strain grafts for extended periods. The study examines the factors affecting the duration and effectiveness of the induced tolerance, including the timing, route, and dosage of injections. The findings contribute to the understanding of immunosuppression and transplantation tolerance in the context of tissue transplantation and organ transplantation.
