tldr: The authors present a study on the vibrational spectra of two-dimensional disordered lattices, specifically simple quadratic and honeycomb lattices. They use a theorem to generalize the displacement eigenfunctions for one-dimensional chains and apply direct numerical techniques to determine the spectra. The study provides insights into the behavior of atomic vibrations in disordered systems.
