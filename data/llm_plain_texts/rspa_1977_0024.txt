tldr: The authors conducted a photoelectron spectroscopic study on the effects of ion-bombardment on single-crystal carbon surfaces, specifically diamond and graphite. They monitored changes in the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (X.p.s.) of graphite as a function of exposure to argon and 57Fe ions. The study revealed that ion bombardment produces partially disordered but structurally distinct surface phases on graphite and diamond crystals. The bombarded surfaces were rather unreactive to oxygen, taking up only a small fraction of a monolayer.
