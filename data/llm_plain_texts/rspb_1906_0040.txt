tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the specificity of opsonic substances in blood serum. They discovered that different bacteria remove specific opsonins from the serum, demonstrating a degree of specificity. Inoculations of vaccines also affected the opsonic content of the serum, with tuberculin increasing tuberculo-opsonin and staphylococcus vaccine increasing staphylococcus opsonin.
