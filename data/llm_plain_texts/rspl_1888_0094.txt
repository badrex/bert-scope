tldr: The author, J. Norman Lockyer, shares his observations on the spectrum of Saturn's rings. He obtained a photograph of the rings' spectrum to determine if collisions there could produce incandescent vapors. Although it's too early to confirm, he suggests that other observers investigate the question using more powerful optical appliances and better weather conditions.
