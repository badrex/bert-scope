tldr: The author presents a new method to control the amplitude of direct and diffracted beams in phase-contrast microscopy using polarizers and a combination of left-handed and right-handed quartz materials. This method allows for better control of phase-contrast effects and improved visibility of non-homogeneities in microscope preparations.
