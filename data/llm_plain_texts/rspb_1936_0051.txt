tldr: The authors developed a new method called the 'Diffusion Porometer' to measure the diffusive capacity of stomata in plants. The method uses hydrogen gas to measure the rate of gas diffusion through stomata, allowing for a direct and continuous measure of stomatal opening and closing. The authors tested the method on various leaves and found that it provided valuable insights into stomatal behavior and plant physiology.
