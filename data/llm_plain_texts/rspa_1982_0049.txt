tldr: The authors discuss an equation that describes the resonant oscillations of a gas in an open-ended tube, focusing on the dissipative effect of eddy formation at the open end. They analyze the equation and its solutions, considering the influence of various mechanisms of dissipation on the oscillations. The results provide insights into the behavior of resonant oscillations in open tubes and can help improve our understanding of the underlying physics.
