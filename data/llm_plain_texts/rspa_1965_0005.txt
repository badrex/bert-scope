  - Pseudo-potential method
tldr: The authors developed the pseudo-potential formalism to calculate phonon frequencies in metals, specifically in sodium. They considered the influence of conduction electrons on the interaction between ions and used the adiabatic approximation to separate the motion of conduction electrons and ions. The calculated phonon frequencies were compared with neutron diffraction measurements and a previous calculation by Toya, showing good agreement. This method may be applied to other metals in the future.
