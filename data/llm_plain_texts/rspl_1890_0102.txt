tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effect of aluminium on the freezing point of gold. They discovered that the presence of aluminium significantly lowers the freezing point of gold, making it an important element in alloying. The author also discussed the possible molecular interactions between aluminium and gold, as well as the influence of other elements like silver and thallium on the freezing point of metals.
