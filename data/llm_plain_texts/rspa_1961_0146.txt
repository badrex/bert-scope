tldr: This article investigates the polymerization of styrene by sulfuric acid, focusing on the molecular weight distribution of the resulting polymers. The authors found that the distribution is bimodal, with one peak corresponding to low molecular weight polymers and the other to high molecular weight polymers. The study provides insights into the reaction mechanism and the factors affecting the molecular weight distribution.
