tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine if goats could be infected with Mediterranean fever and serve as a means of propagation. Blood samples from six goats were tested, and five of them showed agglutination of the bacteria, suggesting they were infected. Further examination of the goats' milk revealed the presence of the bacteria, confirming that goats can be carriers and spreaders of Mediterranean fever. This study highlights the importance of monitoring and controlling the spread of the disease through infected animals.
