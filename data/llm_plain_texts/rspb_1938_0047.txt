revised_title: 'Selective Neutralization of Gonadotrophic Hormones in Pituitary Extracts'
semantic_tags:
  - Hormones
  - Gonadotropins
  - Pituitary gland
  - Ovary stimulation
  - Anti-sera
tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the effects of different pituitary extracts and anti-sera on the ovaries of rats. They discovered that anti-sera can selectively neutralize the luteinizing activity of gonadotrophic extracts, allowing for the study of the separate effects of follicle-stimulating and luteinizing hormones. This research helps in understanding the complex interactions of hormones in the pituitary gland and their impact on the ovaries.
