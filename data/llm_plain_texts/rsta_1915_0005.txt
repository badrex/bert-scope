tldr: 'This article discusses the results of the diurnal variation of the potential gradient of atmospheric electricity at Kew Observatory from 1898 to 1912. The author describes the improvements made to the equipment and methods used to measure the potential gradient, and presents the data collected over the years. The findings provide insight into the local atmospheric conditions and the potential gradient at different heights above ground level.'
