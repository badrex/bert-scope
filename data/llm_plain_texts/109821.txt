tldr: 'In this study, David Brewster investigates the depolarization of light by various mineral, animal, and vegetable bodies. He examines the properties of substances like diamonds, gum arabic, and tortoiseshell, and how they affect the polarization of light. Brewster also introduces the concept of "doubly polarizing crystals" and discusses the implications of these findings for understanding the internal texture of materials.'
