tldr: This study investigates the reflexion of plane gravity waves traveling in water of variable depth using a two-dimensional, irrotational, linear theory. The research proves the existence of a unique velocity potential for general bottom profiles and provides asymptotic results for different wavelength ranges. The findings extend the class of bottom profiles for which numerical results can be achieved.
