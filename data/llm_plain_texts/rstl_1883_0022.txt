tldr: The author examines the ciliated groove (siphonoglyphe) in the stomodseum of various alcyonarian species and discovers its role in the circulation of water within the polyps. The siphonoglyphe is found to be more prominent in siphonozooids than in autozooids, suggesting a connection between the presence of the groove and the reproductive functions of the polyps.
