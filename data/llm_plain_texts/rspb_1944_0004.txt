tldr: This study investigates the relationship between color change and temperature regulation in frogs. The authors found that the difference in the amount of radiant energy absorbed by pale and dark frogs due to melanophore state is not significant. The study suggests that color change may play a role in temperature regulation by affecting the extent to which animals absorb radiant heat, especially under intense sunlight. However, further research is needed to understand the exact role of chromatic behavior in temperature regulation.
