tldr: This article discusses the role of tumour suppressor genes, specifically the p53 and Rb genes, in regulating cell growth. The p53 protein may act by regulating transcription and interacting with the DNA replication apparatus, while the Rb protein acts as a molecular chaperone for transcription factors. The authors also explore the interaction between the p53 protein and the hsp70 chaperone family, which can regulate its function. Understanding these interactions may have implications for cancer diagnosis and treatment.
