tldr: This study investigates the response of contemporary trees to strong winds and uses tree fall-directions to gain insight into the wind patterns during the mid Flandrian period in the Severn Estuary and inner Bristol Channel. The research combines field studies and a literature survey to understand the processes of windprune, windsnap, windtilt, and windthrow. The findings reveal that strong winds during the mid Flandrian period blew chiefly from N.N.W. to S.S.E., with a wider range of directions than the contemporary wind regime.
