tldr: The authors conducted experiments using synchrotron radiation to study the photoelectron spectrum and partial cross sections of nitrogen gas (N2). They analyzed the distribution of cross-sections among various ionic states and vibrational levels, providing insights into the interactions between these states and the photoionization process. Their findings contribute to a better understanding of nitrogen's absorption spectrum and the behavior of photoelectrons in the gas.
