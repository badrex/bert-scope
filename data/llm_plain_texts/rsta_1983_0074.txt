tldr: This article discusses novel methods of processing cement gel to examine and control its microstructure and properties. The authors explore fluid exchange and drying techniques to minimize the effects of drying on cement's microstructure and diffusion rates. They also investigate the use of reactive siliceous materials, admixtures, water/cement ratio, age, and heat treatment to improve cement gel's resistance to drying.
