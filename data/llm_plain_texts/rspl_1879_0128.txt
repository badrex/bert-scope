tldr: The authors conducted experiments on electric discharges in hydrogen and air to determine the height and color variations of the Aurora Borealis. They found that the maximum brilliance occurs at a height of 37.67 miles, and the color changes with the tenuity of the air or gas. The authors also discussed the limitations of the electric discharge at higher altitudes and the importance of understanding the phenomenon of the Aurora.
