tldr: In 1830, a new volcano erupted in the Mediterranean, and John Davy investigated the phenomenon. The volcano's crater contained saltwater and gas, and it emitted dense white vapor and black matter during eruptions. The surrounding sea was discolored by ashes and dust, and no strong odors were detected. The author's findings were mostly negative, similar to Sir Humphry Davy's observations of Vesuvius in 1828.
