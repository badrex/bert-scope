tldr: The article discusses the biological context of antigenic variation in African trypanosomes, which is the mechanism used by the parasite to evade the host's immune system. The author explains the life cycle of the trypanosome and the role of antigenic variation in different stages. The article also highlights the challenges in understanding antigenic variation and the need for further research to develop effective immunization strategies against protozoal diseases.
