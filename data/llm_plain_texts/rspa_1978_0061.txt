tldr: The author proposes an objective interpretation of Lagrangian quantum mechanics, providing a covariant, deterministic, and time-symmetric description of reality. This interpretation does not include the observer or measurement process as fundamental concepts, and it offers a unique history for the universe. The mathematical formalism is based on an action or history functional, which can be seen as a generalization of the classical expression for the action.
