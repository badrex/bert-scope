tldr: This article presents a theoretical investigation into how thermal distortion of bearing components affects the characteristics of journal bearings. The thermoelastic treatment developed incorporates an existing thermohydrodynamic analysis and is applied to circular and partial arc bearings. The results show that thermal distortion reduces the minimum film thickness, increases load capacity, and enhances the stability of the bearing, with more significant effects observed in larger oil-lubricated bearings and higher operating speeds.
