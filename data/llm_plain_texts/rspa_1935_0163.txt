tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the distribution of velocity and temperature in turbulent flow between concentric rotating cylinders. They found that the Modified Vorticity Transport theory and the Momentum Transport theory give contrasting results when applied to this flow. The author also measured the velocity distribution using different types of Pitot tubes and discussed the effects of the tubes on the measurements.
