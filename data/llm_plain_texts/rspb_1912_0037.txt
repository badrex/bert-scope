tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine if certain carcinomatous tumors contained radium. They used an electroscope to measure the acceleration of leak when introducing carcinoma tissue into the instrument. The results showed that three cases of primary carcinoma and one case of secondary carcinoma had sufficient evidence of radium presence, providing insight into the relationship between radium and cancerous tissue.
