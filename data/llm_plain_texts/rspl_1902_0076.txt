tldr: 'This article presents an experimental study on the variation of the critical velocity of water with temperature. The authors found that the critical velocity of water in small pipes varies directly as the viscosity, and they provided a mathematical equation to describe this relationship. The experiments were conducted over a range of temperatures from 4°C to 50°C, and the results were compared with the known variation in the viscosity of water.'
