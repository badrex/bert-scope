tldr: This article examines the concept of super-replicating strategies in finance, which are trading strategies that ensure the value of a portfolio is always greater than or equal to the value of an option at the exercise time. The authors argue that super-replicating strategies do not form the basis for a viable theory of option pricing in continuous time, as they do not lead to tighter bounds on feasible option prices. Instead, alternative approaches based on maximizing portfolio performance are more suitable for dealing with transaction costs and market friction.
