tldr: 'This study investigates the sensitivity of native Xenopus oocytes to the octapeptide angiotensin II (All) and its effects on membrane current responses. The results show that oocytes from 85% of frogs tested gave detectable electrical responses to All. The experiments suggest that All responses are triggered by the activation of an intracellular messenger pathway involving the hydrolysis of inositolphospholipids, mobilization of intracellular calcium by inositol polyphosphates, and activation of calcium-gated chloride channels. The All receptors responsible for these responses are primarily located in the oocyte itself, not in the follicular cells.'
