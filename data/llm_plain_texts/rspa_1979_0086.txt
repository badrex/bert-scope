tldr: The authors present a finite rate theory for periodic forced oscillations in a closed tube, valid for all frequencies, and apply it to calculate continuous motions corresponding to piston frequencies between resonant frequencies. They derive a functional equation that determines the shockless signal leaving the piston and traveling through the model medium, and provide an algebraic scheme to generate continuous periodic solutions of the equation.
