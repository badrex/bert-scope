revised_title: 'Euler's Theory on the Contraction of Planetary Orbits'
semantic_tags:

tldr: Euler discusses the contraction of planetary orbits and the possible shortening of the Earth's days. He raises questions about the accuracy of ancient observations and the invariability of gravity, and suggests that the Earth's rotation around its axis may be becoming more rapid due to the influence of Jupiter.
