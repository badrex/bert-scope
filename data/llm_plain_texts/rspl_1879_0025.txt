revised_title: The Motion of Two Spheres in a Fluid: A Study on Fluid Dynamics
semantic_tags:
  - Fluid dynamics
  - Sphere motion
  - Kinetic energy
  - Velocity potential
  - Microscopic particles
tldr: This article investigates the motion of two spheres in a fluid using the method of images. It explores the kinetic energy of the motion and the velocity potentials, focusing on the behavior of microscopic particles such as closely packed spherules and particles in double outlets. The study aims to provide a better understanding of the dynamics in microscale systems.
