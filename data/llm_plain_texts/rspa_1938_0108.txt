tldr: The authors study the properties of heavy electrons and their interactions with nuclear particles, explaining the creation of showers produced by penetrating cosmic radiation. They apply the theory of heavy electrons to the passage through matter and find that it qualitatively explains various cosmic-ray facts connected with the penetrating radiation. The authors also discuss processes involving light quanta and the interaction of heavy electrons with the radiation field.
