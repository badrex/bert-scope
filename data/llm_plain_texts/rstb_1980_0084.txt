tldr: The author investigates the perception of textures with identical power spectra and finds that the preattentive texture perception system can count the number of local structures, such as "quasi-collinearity," "corner," "closure," and "granularity," but ignores their positions. This demonstrates that the preattentive perceptual system operates quasi-linearly, making only the simplest nonlinear decisions, such as ignoring the phase (position) spectra.
