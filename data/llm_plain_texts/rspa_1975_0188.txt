tldr: The authors conducted magnetic resonance studies on rhenium isotopes, specifically (ReO4)-, to understand the spin Hamiltonian and crystal field parameters. They found that the ground state of the rhenium ion is stabilized by an extension of the tetrahedron, and the e.p.r. linewidth is sensitive to orientation and temperature. The results provide insights into the electronic structure and properties of the rhenium ion in a solid-state environment.
