revised_title: 'Protein Phosphorylation and the Control of Glycogen Metabolism in Skeletal Muscle'
semantic_tags:
  - Glycogen metabolism
  - Protein phosphorylation
  - Enzyme regulation
  - Skeletal muscle
  - Neural and hormonal control
tldr: This article discusses the control of glycogen metabolism in skeletal muscle through a regulatory network involving protein kinases, protein phosphatases, and regulatory proteins. The author explains the effects of adrenalin and insulin on the phosphorylation state of glycogen and the role of calcium ions in neural control. The article also reviews the structure, regulation, and substrate specificities of the protein phosphatases involved in glycogen metabolism.
