tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the boiling point of sulfur using a constant-pressure air thermometer. They developed a formula to calculate the temperature based on the pressure and volume of the gas in the bulb. Although the results were not considered final due to uncertainty in the glass expansion, the authors published their findings for further research.
