tldr: The author discusses the discovery of Palaeolithic implements found in Somaliland by Mr. H. W. Seton-Karr. These implements, made from flint and quartzite, share identical forms with those found in Pleistocene deposits of North Western Europe and other locations. This discovery helps bridge the gap between Palaeolithic man in Britain and India, and supports the unity of the human race between Asia, Africa, and Europe during that time.
