tldr: This article discusses the performance, plans, and potential of the Transit System, a satellite navigation system that provides global position information for navigation and surveying. The author emphasizes the use of Doppler tracking for surveying and highlights the importance of a global, Earth-fixed, geocentric coordinate system for accurate positioning. The article also contrasts the basic elements of traditional surveying techniques and Doppler techniques, and explains the need to consider the geopotential model as part of the Doppler datum definition.
