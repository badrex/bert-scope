tldr: The authors conducted a study on the effects of X-rays on the ovaries of mice and the subsequent impact on the cestrous cycle. They found that X-ray irradiation led to the degeneration of follicles and the disappearance of the ovum, except in cases where it formed corpora lutea atretica. The study also revealed the formation of cords of the second post-irradiation proliferation in most of the ovaries, which may be of spermatic character. The results showed that the ovaries were capable of elaborating oestrin despite the disappearance of follicular tissue.
