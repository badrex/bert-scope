tldr: This study investigates the extra attenuation of sunlight in the near ultraviolet range due to dust scattering in the stratosphere. The researchers used rocket and satellite measurements to analyze the vertical distribution of atmospheric ozone and found that the extra attenuation exceeded Rayleigh air scattering at levels below 30 km. The results provide insights into the impact of volcanic eruptions on the atmosphere and help improve our understanding of atmospheric processes.
