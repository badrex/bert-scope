tldr: The authors investigate the dielectric strength of mixed crystals and find that the breakdown strength increases with the admixture of foreign atoms. They explain this phenomenon using the theory of dielectric breakdown and calculate the mean free path of electrons in mixed crystals. The results are in satisfactory agreement with experimental values, providing a fundamental test of the theory.
