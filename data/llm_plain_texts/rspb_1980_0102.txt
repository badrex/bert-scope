tldr: Researchers conducted a study on denervated frog slow muscle fibres to understand the transformation process after denervation. They used both intracellular and extracellular recording techniques to observe the electrical activity in these fibres. The results showed that after denervation, Na-channels are incorporated into spatially limited areas of the membrane of slow muscle fibres, making them similar to nerve or twitch muscle fibres. This study provides insights into the electrical activity and the process of denervation in slow muscle fibres.
