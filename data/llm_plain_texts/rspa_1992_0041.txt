tldr: This article discusses the use of dynamical calculations for Reflective High-Energy Electron Diffraction (RHEED) in molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth. It focuses on heteroepitaxial growth and interface formation, particularly in AlAs/GaAs structures. The author presents various experimental results and growth models to understand the growth process and resulting composition profiles.
