tldr: The authors analyze the interaction of an atom with electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations in the presence of a pair of perfectly conducting plates. They correct misleading arguments published by Ford and identify the sources of error in his calculations. The study focuses on the radiative level shifts (Lamb shifts) of a hydrogen atom between the plates and provides a comparison with the shift for an isolated atom. The results show that the radiative shifts are influenced by the distance between the plates and the atom's position.
