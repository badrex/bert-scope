tldr: This article applies molecular orbital theory with configuration interaction to study butadiene, a simple conjugated system. The authors calculate the total energy, ultra-violet absorption frequency, oscillator strength, and charge distribution for several singlet and triplet states. They find that configuration interaction is essential for accurate calculations and that the best molecular orbitals reduce the magnitude of configuration interaction in the ground state.
