tldr: This article discusses the measurement and characterization of spatial patterns, dynamics, and chaos in spatially extended dynamical systems and ecologies. The author focuses on locally mixing continuum systems, such as reaction-diffusion equations and coupled map lattices, and individual-based models like probabilistic cellular automata and artificial ecologies. The study's relevance is highlighted in fields like ecology, evolution, and epidemiology, with practical implications for data collection and analysis.
