tldr: Dr. Brinkley discusses the observation of a comet by Captain Hall, noting its small perihelion distance and its similarity to a comet observed in 1593. He attributes the comet's escape from European observers to its proximity to the sun and requests Dr. Wollaston to present his method for computing the comet's elements to the Royal Society.
