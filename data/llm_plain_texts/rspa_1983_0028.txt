tldr: This article presents a crystallographic framework and methodology for studying the symmetry of bicrystals, including grain and interphase boundaries. The authors introduce the concept of a dichromatic complex, which allows for the analysis of non-holosymmetric and non-symmorphic crystals. The study covers all possible bicrystal space groups and provides insights into the existence and interrelation of crystallographically equivalent variants of interfacial structures.
