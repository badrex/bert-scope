tldr: The author compares the structures of the suprarenal bodies in horses and dogs to certain structures in the ovary, specifically the remains of Graafian follicles. They find that the cortical structures of the suprarenal bodies are the obsolete condition of follicles that, in their active period, resembled existing Graafian follicles. This comparison supports the hypothesis that the suprarenal body is an obsolete organ.
