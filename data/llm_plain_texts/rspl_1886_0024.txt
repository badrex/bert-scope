tldr: The author, Professor George Forbes, developed a new combination of a thermopile and galvanometer that is highly sensitive for measuring radiation. This new arrangement is especially suitable for use as a line-thermopile and offers simplicity and cost-effectiveness in construction. The author also describes a method to carry delicate Thomson cells without risking damage to the silk fiber suspension.
