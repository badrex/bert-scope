tldr: This article studies the dispersion of waves in an isotropic, homogeneous, and dispersive medium triggered by a transient point source. The author uses Fourier synthesis and analysis to derive an asymptotic solution for large time, showing that the radiation field disperses into expanding concentric wave trains bounded by spherical advancing and/or rear edges. The article applies the findings to elastic plate deflections and Klein-Gordon governed motions.
