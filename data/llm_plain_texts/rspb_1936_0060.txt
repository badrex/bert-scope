tldr: The authors conducted a study on the proteolytic digestion and the development of the pancreas in the ammocoete larva of Lampetra planeri. They discovered that the "pancreas" in the ammocoete larva is an endocrine organ and not connected to the gut epithelium. The study also found that the cells with large nucleoli, which are believed to be zymogen cells, are concentrated in the dorso-lateral wall of the intestine and the spiral valve. This research provides a basis for comparing proteolytic digestion in Cyclostomata with that in Tunicata and Pisces.
