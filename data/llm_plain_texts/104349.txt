tldr: This article provides a brief explanation of Dr. Alexander Stuart's discoveries about the heart's muscular structure and function. Dr. Stuart found that the heart is a single muscle with parallel fibers, and its contraction is caused by the influx of arterial blood rather than nervous spirits. This understanding of the heart's anatomy and function has implications for understanding blood circulation and heart health.
