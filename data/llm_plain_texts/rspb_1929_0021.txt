tldr: This article investigates the effect of trypan blue on malignant cells and tumours. The author found that trypan blue does not have a significant impact on the growth of transplanted tumours, but it does affect the growth of tumour grafts when injected soon after transplantation. The study also shows that trypan blue has a more pronounced effect on the tumour stroma rather than the malignant cells themselves. The author discusses the cytological results and the potential implications for cancer treatment.
