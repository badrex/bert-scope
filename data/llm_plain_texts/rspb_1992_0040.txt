tldr: The author investigates the costs of egg rejection in the yellow-browed leaf warbler, a host species that has strong egg discrimination against parasitic cuckoos. They find that rejection costs, such as mistakenly ejecting their own eggs, can lead to the loss of this defense mechanism, allowing cuckoos to continue exploiting other host species. This study provides a possible explanation for the coexistence of parasites and their hosts.
