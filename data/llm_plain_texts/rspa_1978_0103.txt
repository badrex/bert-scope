tldr: The article investigates the second Painlevé transcendent, a mathematical function related to nonlinear wave motion, and presents numerical and asymptotic approximations to it. The study focuses on the behavior of the transcendent in the oscillatory regime and its relevance to recent investigations of nonlinear wave motion, particularly the Korteweg-de Vries equation. The results provide insights into the properties of the transcendent and its applications in various wave motion phenomena.
