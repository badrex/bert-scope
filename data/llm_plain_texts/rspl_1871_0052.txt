tldr: The author investigates the formation of various organisms from the "proligerous pellicle," a layer of bacteria and other microorganisms that forms on organic infusions. They describe different processes, such as heterogenetic biocrasis, where living units combine to form new organisms with different properties. The author also discusses the role of temperature in the development of these organisms and the potential for creating animal or vegetal forms from embryonal areas in the pellicles of hay-infusions.
