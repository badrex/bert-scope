tldr: This study investigates the delayed effects of pericardial removal on cardiac function and health in cats. The researchers found that removing the fibrous pericardium led to changes in heart size and function, with some cats experiencing hypertrophy of the left ventricle. The study highlights the importance of the pericardium in preventing distension of the heart and maintaining overall heart health.
