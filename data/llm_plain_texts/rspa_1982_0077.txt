tldr: This article proves the existence of analytic solutions for Einstein's vacuum field equations with analytic data on past null infinity and incoming null hypersurfaces. The author demonstrates the convergence of the expansion coefficients and shows that the solutions possess a regular point, providing insights into the behavior of gravitational fields in asymptotically flat spacetimes.
