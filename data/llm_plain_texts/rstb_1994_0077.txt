tldr: This article discusses the importance of estimating statistical significance in sequence alignments for molecular biology. It presents algorithms for global and local alignment, and explores the differences in statistical behavior between linear and logarithmic growth regions. The author also introduces the Poisson clumping heuristic for estimating the probability of large scores in the logarithmic region.
