tldr: This collection of papers discusses the predicted transformation of the Arctic due to anthropogenic warming. The Arctic is expected to warm significantly more than the rest of the world, leading to changes in atmospheric circulation, ocean thermohaline structure, and impacts on terrestrial and marine ecosystems. The melting of permafrost, sea ice, and glaciers could contribute to sea-level rise. The authors emphasize the importance of monitoring environmental changes in the Arctic for early detection of significant warming.
