tldr: The article presents a theoretical treatment of light diffraction in striated muscle fibers, considering the propagation of light through an idealized representation of the muscle structure. The study leads to the conclusion that the intensity of the first-order diffracted beams varies cyclically with the thickness of the fiber, and even when A and I bands have equal widths, there is appreciable intensity in the second-order diffracted beams. The observed birefringence in the muscle fibers is found to be greater than the mean of A and I birefringence weighted according to the band widths.
