tldr: The authors successfully prepared and trapped phenyl radicals in various solid matrices using chemical reactions at low temperatures. They observed the electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrum of the phenyl radical in different matrices, including water, benzene, and perfluorocyclohexane. The ESR spectrum of the phenyl radical consists of nine hyperfine lines, which provide insights into the nature of the orbital occupied by the unpaired electron and the reasons for the high reactivity of the phenyl radical.
