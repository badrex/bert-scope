tldr: The authors measured the surface resistance of normal and superconducting tin at 36 kMc/s and found that the resistance in both states exhibits a marked anisotropy. They used a calorimetric method to determine the heat generated by the electromagnetic field in the surface of the metal, which is a measure of the surface resistance. The results confirm Pippard's conclusion that the observed behavior at high frequencies is difficult to reconcile with a 'two-parameter two-fluid' model of a superconductor.
