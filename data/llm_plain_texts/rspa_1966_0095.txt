tldr: The authors explore the use of laser light sources in schlieren-interferometer systems, discussing the challenges and opportunities they present. They aim to develop a versatile optical system capable of fulfilling various functions, such as interferometry, deflexion mapping, and schlieren methods, with minimal adjustments to its components. The study focuses on overcoming difficulties associated with laser light and achieving these goals in a specific type of optical system.
