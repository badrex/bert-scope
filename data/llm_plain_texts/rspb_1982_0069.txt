tldr: This article provides a supplementary list of nuclear DNA amounts in angiosperms, including estimates for 240 new species and additional estimates for 41 previously listed species. The authors emphasize the importance of easily accessible information on DNA amounts in various organisms and discuss the usefulness of DNA content as a character in cytotaxonomical and evolutionary studies. The article also highlights the development of molecular methods that reveal more details of genome composition and the significance of DNA content in determining nucleotypic effects.
