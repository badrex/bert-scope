tldr: This study investigates the potential difference between two aqueous solutions of potassium ferrocyanide separated by a membrane of colloidal copper ferrocyanide. The authors test the Nernst equation and discuss the factors affecting the accuracy of their measurements, such as ionization uncertainty and deviation from ideal solution laws.
