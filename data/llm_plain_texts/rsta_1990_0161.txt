tldr: The article discusses the concept of chaotic advection in fluid mechanics, where fluid particles move chaotically even with simple flow fields. It introduces the Lagrangian representation and the kinematic template, which is the natural motion of fluid particles. The article also explores various applications of chaotic advection, such as flow visualization, particle motion around objects, and particle separators.
