tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the resistance to tumor grafts in the offspring of immunized rats. They found evidence that this acquired characteristic is transmitted to the offspring to some extent, suggesting that resistance to cancer may be inherited. This research provides insights into the potential for inherited immunity against cancer.
