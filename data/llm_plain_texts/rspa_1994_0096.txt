tldr: The authors used supercomputer modeling and finite-element continuum damage mechanics to study the effect of weld and heat affected zone materials on the creep deformation and failure of pipe weldments. They found that good creep rupture ductility and strength of the weld material are necessary for long vessel lifetimes. The study led to the development of a methodology for weldment design using supercomputer-based analysis techniques, which is quick, accurate, and a viable design tool.
