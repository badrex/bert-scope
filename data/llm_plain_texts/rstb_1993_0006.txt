tldr: 'This study examines the changes in the land snail fauna of Madeira Island during the Quaternary period. The research analyzes fossil land snail shells found in aeolianite deposits, dating from the middle Pleistocene to recent times. The findings reveal substantial faunal changes over the course of the Quaternary, indicating a significant influence of climatic change. The study also explores the relationship between faunal change, extinctions, and introductions, and human settlement on the island.'
