tldr: The author investigates the properties of sound waves in a tube and develops a mathematical theory to describe their behavior. They find that the particle velocity and density of the fluid are connected by an invariable relation, and that there are two types of sound waves: positive waves of condensation and negative waves of rarefaction. The author also discusses the resistance to sound waves in different gases and the formation of bores in sound waves.
