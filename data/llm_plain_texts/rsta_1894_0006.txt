  - Rotational motion
  - Irrotational motion
tldr: The author discusses a spherical vortex and its external motion, focusing on the conditions under which the rotational motion inside the vortex can be continuous with the irrotational motion outside it. The study involves the use of mathematical equations and the analysis of the motion's properties, such as velocity, pressure, and molecular rotation.
