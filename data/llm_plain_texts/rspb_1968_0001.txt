tldr: The authors studied the cell walls of siphoneous green algae, specifically focusing on the non-cellulosic structural polysaccharide, mannan. They discovered that the mannan in these algae forms a crystalline structure and is oriented differently in the outer and inner layers of the cell walls. This research helps to understand the unique architecture of these algae's cell walls and their growth processes.
