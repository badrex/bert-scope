tldr: This study investigates the formation and characteristics of mud drapes in sand-wave deposits, specifically in the Folkestone Beds (Early Cretaceous, southeast England). The deposition and preservation of mud drapes on sand waves are influenced by factors such as sand-wave asymmetry, bottom concentration of suspended mud, time-velocity asymmetry, and tidal current strength. The research provides insights into the depositional cycles and tidal regimes of the early Cretaceous period.
