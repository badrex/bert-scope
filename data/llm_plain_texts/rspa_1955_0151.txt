tldr: This article investigates storm waves in the North Atlantic Ocean using data from the Ocean Weather Ship Weather Explorer. It finds that wave generation in deep and shallow water has different conditions, with deep water waves increasing in equilibrium value with wind speed. The study also shows that wave steepness decreases as fetch increases, reaching a steady value after about 100 miles.
