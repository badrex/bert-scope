tldr: The author describes the collection and study of Entomostraca species, particularly Copepoda, in Kerguelen Island and Rodriguez during the Transit of Venus Expeditions.

The discovery of a freshwater species in Kerguelen Island is particularly interesting due to its similarity to European species found in similar environments.
