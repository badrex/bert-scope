tldr: 'The authors conducted a study on interference in Aspergillus nidulans, a type of fungus. They analyzed the data from three crosses and found that the two closely linked pairs of markers had a significant effect on viability. The results showed that the data agreed with a ratio of 1:2:1, indicating a balanced distribution of genetic markers. This study helps to understand the genetic interactions and recombination in fungi.'
