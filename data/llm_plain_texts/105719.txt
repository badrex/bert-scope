tldr: 'A unique fish was caught near Bristol, and its unusual features are described in detail. The fish has a squarish mouth with sharp teeth, a hollow tube-like throat, and two long, elastic horns on its neck. It also has two fins near its shoulders and two short, human-like feet near its breast. The skin is dark brown with spots and lacks scales. The author, James Ferguson, seeks the opinion of the Royal Society on whether this fish deserves further study.'
