tldr: This article explores the structure of ethylene and ethane molecules using two different methods, H-M and H-L-S-P, to understand their valency and bonding. The author discusses the importance of hybridized wave-functions in creating stronger bonds and more stable molecular configurations. The study focuses on the ethylene molecule, comparing it to ethane, and provides insights into the arrangement of atoms and the energy of different models.
