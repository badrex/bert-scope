revised_title: 'Further Researches on the Physiology of Invertebrate Renal Organs and Salivary Secretions'
semantic_tags:

tldr: This article investigates the renal organs and salivary secretions of invertebrates, specifically focusing on starfishes and Mollusca. The author discovers uric acid in the renal organs of starfishes, proving their renal function. Additionally, the author examines the secretions of the salivary glands in cuttlefish and limpets, finding that they contain enzymes that break down starch and produce glucose, as well as mucin and sulphocyanates.
