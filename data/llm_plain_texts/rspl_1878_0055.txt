tldr: The author studied a minute septic organism found in decomposing animal matter and observed its life-history, behavior, and movements. They discovered that the organism is associated with the breaking up of decomposing animal matter and can change its form and size by attaching itself to the decomposing tissues. The author also determined the thermal death point of the organism, which is the temperature at which it can no longer survive.
