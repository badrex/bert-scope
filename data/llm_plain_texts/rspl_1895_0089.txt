tldr: The author studied the absorption of extreme violet and ultra-violet rays by hemoglobin and its compounds. They found that the absorption band in the extreme violet depends on the iron-containing moiety of the hemoglobin molecule. The author also discovered that the combination of hemoglobin with oxygen leads to a notable acceleration of the intra-molecular movement, causing the absorption of the extreme violet rays.
