tldr: The author investigates the transformation of optical wave-surfaces by homogeneous strain, focusing on the effects of electric and magnetic eolotropy on wave properties. The study explains how the strain of wave-surfaces can lead to different types of wave properties, such as double refraction, and provides insights into the behavior of electromagnetic waves in various media.
