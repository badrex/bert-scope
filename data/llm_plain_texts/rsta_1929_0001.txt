tldr: The author investigates the relationship between the anatomical structure of wood and its anisotropic elasticity. They demonstrate that the form and arrangement of wood cells contribute to the anisotropic character of its elastic properties. The study provides a partial explanation for wood's elastic behavior and highlights the importance of understanding its structure for accurate estimations of its mechanical properties.
