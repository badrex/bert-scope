  - Equivalent weight
tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments to determine the atomic weight of chlorine by directly burning it with hydrogen. They found the equivalent weight of chlorine to be 35.195, which is slightly higher than previous calculations. This method allowed for a more accurate comparison between chlorine and hydrogen, potentially reducing systematic errors in atomic weight determinations.'
