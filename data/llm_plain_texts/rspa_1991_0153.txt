  - Asymmetric collapse
tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the collapse of cavities in emulsion explosives and their role in initiating explosions. They found that asymmetric bubble collapse forms a high-speed jet that hits the downstream wall, creating a shock wave and heating the gas within the cavity. This process leads to the ignition of the explosive material, with the jet's impact point being the main ignition mechanism.
