tldr: The authors study the interaction of relaxation and diffusion in physical systems, such as water waves and thermo-non-equilibrium gases. They find that under certain conditions, the coexistence of relaxation and diffusion can enhance dispersive waves, leading to the formation of solitary waves. This phenomenon is demonstrated through asymptotic analysis and numerical simulations.
