tldr: This article discusses the influence of alkaline carbonates on uric acid and the protective agents that affect its decomposition. The author also examines the urine of herbivorous mammals, discovering that uric acid is absent when the urine is alkaline but present when it is acidic. This research helps to understand the presence or absence of uric acid in herbivorous mammals' urine and its relation to the reaction of their urine.
