tldr: This study compares the dietary ecology of four indigenous groups in Brazil, revealing differences in their primary crops and animal prey. The authors suggest that these differences may be due to the diverse environmental factors in the Amazon Basin, and that cultural conventions help distinguish one group from another. The findings challenge single-factor models used to explain human ecology in Amazonian forests and highlight the complex mosaic of dietary possibilities faced by forest-dwelling humans.
