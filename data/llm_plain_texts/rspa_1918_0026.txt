tldr: This article discusses the critical loading of struts and structures, focusing on the stability analysis and bending moments. The authors present a method for determining the bending moments at supports and points in the beam, which is essential for understanding the structural stability under various loading conditions. The study aims to provide insights into the strength of constructions and prevent failure due to excessive bending moments and deflections.
