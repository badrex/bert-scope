tldr: The author investigates the bactericidal action of light on bacteria, specifically the spores of Bacillus anthracis, and the effect of colored screens on this action. They find that sunlight has a significant bactericidal effect and that certain colors can enhance or reduce this effect. The author also discovers that the action of light is direct on the spores and not on the food material they are suspended in.
