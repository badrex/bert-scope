tldr: The authors conducted experiments on gaseous mixtures of helium, hydrogen, argon, and other gases to study their pressure-volume relationships and compressibility. They found that the dominant partner in a gaseous mixture influences its behavior, and that expansions occur when gases are mixed at constant pressure. The study also revealed that the isotherms of gaseous mixtures can be predicted from those of their pure components under certain conditions.
