tldr: The authors investigated the distribution of calcium in the pollen tubes of two grass species, Zea mays and Pennisetum americanum, using chlorotetracycline fluorescence and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis. They found that the distribution of calcium in grass pollen tubes differs from that in Lilium longiflorum, with a less pronounced or absent basipetal concentration gradient in the subapical zone. This difference is due to the unique organization and growth mechanism of grass pollen tubes, which rely on pre-existing polysaccharide particles (P-particles) for wall growth.
