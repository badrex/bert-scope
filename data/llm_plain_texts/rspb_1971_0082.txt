tldr: The authors studied the structure and adaptation of beetle eyes, specifically the neuropteran type, in various lighting conditions. They discovered that during dark-light adaptation, the retinula cell bodies move away from the cone and form a crystalline tract. This movement is crucial for the beetle's vision and helps them adjust to different lighting environments.
