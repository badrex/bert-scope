tldr: This article presents a quantitative study of X-ray reflexion by sylvine, a mineral with two similar atoms. The authors investigate the temperature dependence of reflexion intensity and compare their findings with theoretical predictions. The results show a close agreement between theory and experiment, demonstrating the importance of considering the crystal's mosaic structure and the effect of heat motion on reflexion intensity.
