tldr: This article describes the successful use of a new blood-stopping liquor in treating two patients at St. Thomas's Hospital in London. The patients, a woman with an inveterate scurvy and a man with a severe leg wound, both experienced effective blood clotting and healing after the application of the astringent liquor. The King, impressed by the results, ordered the medicine to be prepared for use in his armies and fleets.
