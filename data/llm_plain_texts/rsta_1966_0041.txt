tldr: This article discusses the erosion of materials caused by rain and its impact on various industries, such as aircraft, missiles, and steam turbines. The authors investigate the factors affecting rain erosion, including impact velocity, drop size, and angle of incidence. They also propose a standardized testing method to compare the erosion resistance of different materials and present the erosion behavior of various materials under specific conditions.
