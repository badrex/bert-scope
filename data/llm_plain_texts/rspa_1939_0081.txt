tldr: This article investigates the accuracy of Konig's formula for the Rayleigh disk method, which is used to measure sound intensities. The authors find that the formula is generally accurate but may be affected by viscosity in low-pressure environments. They also discover that discrepancies in experimental results are due to air vortex motion near the disk.
