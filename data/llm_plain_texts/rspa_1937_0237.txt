tldr: The authors studied the behavior of atomic hydrogen discharge tubes with and without a phosphoric acid coating. They found that a coated tube provided a more stable output, while an uncoated tube showed rapid decay in atomic hydrogen output. The authors also discovered that the condition of the wall surface significantly affected the atom output, with higher currents causing rapid heating and stripping of the protective water film, leading to lower efficiency.
