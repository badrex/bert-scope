tldr: The author investigates the role of the vagus nerve in the rhythm of the frog's heart. They use a graphic method to study the effects of the vagus nerve on the heart's contractions and find that the rhythm is independent of the muscle's excitability, suggesting that separate impulses from motor ganglia cause the heart's contractions.
