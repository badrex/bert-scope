tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate electron polarisation using double scattering and observed an asymmetry in the secondary scattering. They developed a method to measure the intensity of the secondary scattering at 0° and 180° azimuth, which could be applied to further study of electron polarisation and its potential applications.
