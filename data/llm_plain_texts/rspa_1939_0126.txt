tldr: The authors analyzed the spectrum of rubidium hydride and derived the potential curves and wave functions for the molecule. They used the Franck-Condon treatment and wave mechanics to explain the vibrational intensity distribution, which includes three parabolae of strong bands. The study provides insights into the molecular structure and bonding of rubidium hydride.
