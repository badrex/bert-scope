tldr: The author describes a method to experimentally determine the velocities of ions during electrolysis by observing the phenomena at the junction of two salt solutions. They tested this method on various ions, such as barium, calcium, silver, and the bichromate group, and found that the results agreed with the values theoretically deduced by Kohlrausch. This study helps to improve our understanding of the behavior of ions in electrolytes and contributes to the development of new methods for measuring ionic velocities.
