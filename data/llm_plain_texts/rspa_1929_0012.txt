tldr: The authors analyzed the band spectra of alkaline earth halides, focusing on the fluorides of calcium, strontium, and barium. They used quantum analysis to classify the band systems and study their gross structure, finding that these molecules have great vibrational stability and often exhibit long sequences in their spectra. The authors also discussed the molecular emitters and the vibrational effect in these molecules.
