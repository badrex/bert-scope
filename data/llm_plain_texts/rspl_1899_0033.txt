tldr: The author, Captain W. de W. Abney, conducted experiments to determine the color sensations in terms of luminosity based on the Young theory. He found the positions in the spectrum for red, green, and blue sensations and used these to calculate the composition of white light. The study also involved matching colors to determine the luminosity of the three sensations and comparing the results with previous research.
