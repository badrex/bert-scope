revised_title: Ionization of Hydrogen and Oxygen: Critical Potentials and Dissociation

  - Dissociation
tldr: The authors conducted experiments on ionization in hydrogen and oxygen using electron impact. They found that a 16-volt electron can ionize hydrogen molecules without causing dissociation, while a higher voltage of about 20.2 volts may cause dissociation simultaneously with ionization. The results suggest that ionization of molecular hydrogen does not necessarily involve dissociation.
