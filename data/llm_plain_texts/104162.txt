tldr: This article describes an instrument designed by Sir Isaac Newton and Dr. Halley for observing the Moon's distance from fixed stars at sea. The instrument uses a telescope and two mirrors to accurately measure the distance, even in the presence of ship movement. This method allows for more precise determination of latitude and observation times compared to existing methods.
