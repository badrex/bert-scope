tldr: The author observed the effects of destroying the membrana tympani of the ear and found that the sense of hearing was not entirely lost. They suggested that the membranes of the fenestrae ovalis and rotunda might compensate for the loss of the membrana tympani. The paper also includes additional remarks on the mode of hearing in cases where the membrana tympani is destroyed.
