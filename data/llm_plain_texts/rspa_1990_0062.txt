tldr: This article presents a rational approach to solving problems related to semi-saturated soil behavior, which is crucial for understanding the dynamic response of embankments and dams. The authors extend the formulation presented in part I to problems of semi-saturated behavior with the assumption of free air ingress. They also provide an approximate reconstruction of the failure of the lower San Fernando dam during the 1971 earthquake.
