revised_title: 'Radiation and Retarding Force on Radiating Particles'
semantic_tags:
  - Radiation Theory
  - Retarding Force
  - Electromagnetic Radiation
  - Oscillators
  - Momentum
tldr: The author discusses the energy taken up by particles under the action of white light and the energy transferred to a molecule by radiation. They explore the effects of radiation on oscillating particles and the retarding force acting on radiating particles. The author also compares their method of treatment with that of Planck and Abraham, highlighting the differences and similarities in their approaches.
