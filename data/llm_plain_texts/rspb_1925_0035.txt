tldr: This study investigates the crystalline lens's oxygen uptake and its autoxidation system. The researchers found that a disturbed or partially destroyed autoxidation system in the lens can lead to health issues. They also discovered that ultra-violet light and heat rays can decrease the lens's glutathione content, which may contribute to cataract formation.
