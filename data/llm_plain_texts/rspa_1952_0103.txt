tldr: The authors present a new approach to Eddington's wave-tensor calculus based on the concept of scale invariance. They derive the simple measurement conditions and apply them to a class of observables called 'primitive'. The results are used to represent particles by scalars, vectors, and a six-vector in a certain -space, and to discuss the fine structure of the hydrogen spectrum.
