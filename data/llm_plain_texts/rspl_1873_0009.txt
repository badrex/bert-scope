tldr: This article examines the nervous system of Actinia, focusing on the histology of chromatophores and their role in sensory perception. The author criticizes previous research and provides new insights into the structure and function of the nervous system, including the presence of a continuous plexus around the Actinia and beneath each chromatophore. The article also discusses the minute structure of muscular fibers and their attached fibrous tissue in the base of Actinia.
