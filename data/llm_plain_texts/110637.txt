tldr: The author, James Carson, discusses the motion of blood and the role of elasticity in the cardiovascular system. He presents additional facts and observations to support his and Sir David Barry's theory of suction, addressing objections from other physiologists. He also demonstrates the effect of elasticity on blood flow by comparing blood quantities from different methods of slaughtering an ox.
