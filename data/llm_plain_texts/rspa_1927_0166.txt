tldr: The authors conducted experiments on high-current fuse discharges, analyzing the spectra produced when wires are suddenly short-circuited. They observed shifts, reversals, broadenings, and absorptions in the spectra, which they studied using copper and iron wires. The results provide insights into the behavior of materials under high pressure and temperature conditions.
