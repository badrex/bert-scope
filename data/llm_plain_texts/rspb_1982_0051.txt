tldr: The study investigates fluid reabsorption in the Necturus proximal tubule when kidneys are perfused with solutions of different osmolarities. The rate of fluid absorption is inversely proportional to the osmolarity of the perfusion fluid, while sodium uptake remains constant. The results show that none of the examined models can adequately explain fluid absorption in this epithelium.
