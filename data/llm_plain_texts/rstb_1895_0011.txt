tldr: This article investigates the mechanisms of gaseous exchange in plants, focusing on the role of stomata in the process. The author presents a historical overview of previous research and conducts experiments to determine the extent to which stomata contribute to gaseous exchange in leaves. The study concludes that both cuticular and stomatic exchanges play important roles in the process, and the stomata's function is to facilitate the entrance and exit of carbon dioxide and oxygen.
