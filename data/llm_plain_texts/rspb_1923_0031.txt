tldr: This study investigates the effects of high air temperatures and muscular exertion on coal miners. The research found that miners working in warmer conditions consumed more food and drank more water to cope with the heat. The study also showed that the miners' calorie consumption increased with higher temperatures, and they consumed more salted foods, which may be related to salt loss through sweating.
