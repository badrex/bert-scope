tldr: This article presents a new theory of elasticity in general relativity, distinct from Synge's theory. The new theory defines an elastic body motion and its properties, including stress being related to strain by a formula analogous to Hooke's law. The article also discusses the differences between the new theory and Synge's theory, such as the system of differential equations being of the second order in the new theory, while it is of the third order in Synge's theory. Additionally, the article investigates shock waves in an elastic medium using a method related to Lichnerowicz's investigation of gravitational waves.
