tldr: This article investigates the representation of morphology in the lexical-semantic system and how it relates to morphological errors in language acquisition. The study supports the hypothesis that morphology is represented autonomously in both the semantic and lexical components of the system. Damage to these representations can result in morphological errors in transcoding tasks, and the co-occurrence of morphological and phonemic errors can be accounted for by several hypotheses, although their theoretical meaning remains uncertain.
