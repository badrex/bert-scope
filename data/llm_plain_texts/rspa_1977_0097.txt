tldr: The authors conducted molecular dynamics simulations of model systems of 256 rigid, homonuclear diatomic molecules interacting through atom-atom and quadrupole-quadrupole potentials. They studied the effects of these potentials on the structure and properties of diatomic liquids, finding that the addition of a quadrupole term significantly changes the structure and thermodynamic properties of the system.
