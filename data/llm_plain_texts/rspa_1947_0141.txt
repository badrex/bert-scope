tldr: The authors measured the total scattering cross-sections of beryllium and aluminium using a transmission method for neutrons with energies between 0.5 and 4 MeV. They discovered resonances in the scattering by beryllium at a neutron energy of 1.5 MeV and in the scattering by aluminium at neutron energies of 1.8 and 2.3 MeV. The cross-section for the reaction Be-9(n,Î±)He-6 also has a resonance at 1.67 MeV, and an accurate determination of the cross-section for this reaction was made. The authors discussed the properties of the energy level responsible for the resonances in the case of beryllium.
