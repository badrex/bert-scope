tldr: This article investigates the susceptibility of amphibian eggs to various external agents, such as NH4OH and HgCl2, and their effects on embryonic development. The authors find that the eggs show a differential susceptibility pattern, with certain areas being more affected than others. They also observe that distilled water has a slight toxic effect on the embryos, while well water provides a more suitable environment for development.
