tldr: The authors discuss the analysis of pebbles collected from the deep Atlantic Ocean and the structure of the English Channel. They find that the pebbles are of glacial origin and suggest that the sediments in the area contain material transported by ice or floating icebergs. They also examine the geological formations and sedimentation in the English Channel, noting that the Channel's floor is mostly flat and formed of bare rock, with Chalk being the most common geological formation. Lastly, they discuss the deep ocean margins and the need for further study of the continental shelf, slope, and adjacent deep oceans.
