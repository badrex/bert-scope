tldr: The authors apply the aspherical nucleus theory to the Balmer series of hydrogen, using quantum theory to calculate the frequencies of the series. They find that the hydrogen nucleus is oblate, and their calculations show better agreement with experimental observations than Sommerfeld's relativistic formula. This work contributes to the understanding of atomic structure and the behavior of electrons in atoms.
