tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effect of water vapour on the velocities of ions produced by X-rays in air. They found that while the removal of water vapour had a small effect on the velocities of positive ions, it significantly increased the velocities of negative ions by a factor ranging between 2 and 30. This discovery sheds light on the behavior of ions in moist and dry air, which is essential for understanding atmospheric physics and gas ionization processes.
