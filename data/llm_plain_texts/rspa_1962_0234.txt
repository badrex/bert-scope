revised_title: Measurement of High-Field Hall Effect by Inductive Method
semantic_tags:
  - Hall effect

  - Galvanomagnetic effect
  - Eddy currents
  - Resistivity
tldr: The authors present a new method to measure the Hall coefficient in high-field regions using an inductive method. They discuss the theory and experimental evidence for this method and apply it to various metals, finding that the high-field Hall coefficients are about 5% larger in magnitude than the theoretical values.
