tldr: The authors study the motion of ellipsoidal particles in a viscous fluid, extending Einstein's work on spherical particles. They find that the increase in viscosity can be represented by a modified formula of Einstein's type, with an indeterminate numerical factor. The authors also explore the forces acting on the particles and the possible motions of a particle subject to no external forces.
