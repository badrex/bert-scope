tldr: The authors conducted experiments with a light-mill to study the forces acting on it when exposed to light. They discovered that all the forces at play are internal, with no external forces directly related to radiation. The motion of the light-mill is due to the forces acting between the revolving mill and its enclosure. This research helps to understand the nature of the force producing motion in a body exposed to rays of heat and light.
