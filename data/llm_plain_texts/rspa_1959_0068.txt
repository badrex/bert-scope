tldr: This study investigates the stability and decomposition mechanism of monovalent inorganic azides. The stability decreases in the order of increasing ionization potential of the metal. The authors measured various physical properties, such as refractive indices, absorption spectra, photoconductivity, and melting points. They also considered the relation of these measurements to the decomposition mechanism and the role of metal particles in the process.
