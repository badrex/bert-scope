tldr: The author presents a tenth memoir on quantics, discussing the numerical and real generating functions of covariants in algebraic geometry. They introduce the concept of segregates and congregates, and establish a theorem that every congregate can be expressed as a linear function of the segregates of the same deg-order. The memoir also explores the use of these functions in understanding the properties of covariants in various mathematical scenarios.
