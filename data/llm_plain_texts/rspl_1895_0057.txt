tldr: The authors analyzed gases from various mineral waters and incombustible gases to determine the presence of argon. They found that some samples contained a higher percentage of argon than in normal air, but it appears to play a minor role in the animal economy. The authors also tested a gas from a boiling spring in Iceland and found a higher proportion of argon than in air, with no helium detected.
