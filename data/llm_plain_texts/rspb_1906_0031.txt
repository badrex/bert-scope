tldr: The authors studied Voges and Proskauer's reaction, a color test used to differentiate certain bacteria. They discovered that the reaction is caused by acetylmethylcarbinol, a substance produced by bacteria when breaking down glucose. The reaction occurs when acetylmethylcarbinol is oxidized to diacetyl, which then reacts with a component in peptone water. This research helps in identifying and understanding the metabolic processes of various bacteria.
