tldr: The author, Brian J. Ford, discovers and examines the preserved microtechnique specimens of Antony van Leeuwenhoek, a pioneer in microbiology. These specimens, which include hand-cut sections of plant and animal material, provide valuable insight into the state of microtechnique in the 17th century. The author also discusses van Leeuwenhoek's life, achievements, and the controversies surrounding his work. This rediscovery of van Leeuwenhoek's specimens contributes to the understanding of the history of microscopy and microtechnique.
