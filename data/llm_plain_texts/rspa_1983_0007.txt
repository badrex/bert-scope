tldr: This article presents an analytical investigation of the exponential atomic collision model, a versatile model for treating non-adiabatic phenomena associated with curve-crossings and non-crossings in atomic collisions. The authors derive a phase-integral derivation of the two-state semiclassical collision-matrix within a general exponential model, providing a better understanding of the model's properties and its applicability to real situations.
