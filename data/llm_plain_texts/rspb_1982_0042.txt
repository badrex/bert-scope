tldr: This study investigates how the distribution of sodium and potassium channels in mammalian myelinated nerves changes during regeneration and development in rabbit sciatic nerves. The research shows that the number of sodium channels increases in regenerating nerves, and potassium currents contribute to the action potential in both regenerating and developing nerves. The sensitivity to the potassium-blocking agent 4-aminopyridine decreases over time in these nerves.
