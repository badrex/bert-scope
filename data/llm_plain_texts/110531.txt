tldr: The author, Thomas Graham, investigates the constitution of various salts, including oxalates, nitrates, phosphates, sulphates, and chlorides. He explores the relationships between water and the magnesian class of oxides, the formation of double oxalates, and the existence of supernitrates. Graham also discusses the composition of phosphoric and arsenic acids, as well as the properties of various phosphates, arseniates, and sulphates.
