revised_title: 'Endogenous GABA and GABAa Receptors in Developing Rat Optic Nerve'
semantic_tags:
  - Neurotransmitter GABA
  - GABAa receptors
  - Axonal excitability
  - Optic nerve development
  - Rat neuroscience
tldr: The study found that GABA, a major inhibitory neurotransmitter, is present in developing rat optic nerve and interacts with GABAa receptors. This interaction influences axonal excitability and impulse conduction in the optic nerve, which may play a role in the development of the visual system.
