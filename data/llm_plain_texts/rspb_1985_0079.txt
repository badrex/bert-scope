tldr: This article discusses the role of oncogenes, particularly the myc oncogene, in normal and malignant growth. It focuses on the activation of the myc oncogene in B and T lymphoid tumours, exploring the chromosome translocations that occur and their effects on myc expression. The article also examines the consequences of these translocations on cell cycle control and tumour formation.
