tldr: The article discusses the eigenfunction expansion of an arbitrary function in terms of the solutions of the differential equation where the potential is a periodic function. The author presents the expansion formula, the spectrum of values, and the Parseval formula. The article also explores the connection between the problem and other eigenvalue problems, as well as the conditions for the occurrence of zeros in the eigenfunctions.
