tldr: The authors compared the spinal flexor reflex and decerebrate extensor reflex, examining differences in their transmission, tetanus myogram curves, and the influence of factors such as stimulus frequency, intensity, and initial muscle stretch. They found that the reflexes have distinct characteristics, with the spinal reflex showing a more direct transmission of centripetal impulses to motoneurons and the decerebrate reflex involving additional motoneurons.
