tldr: The authors studied the effect of composition and structure on the tensile properties of high-purity iron single crystals, focusing on the question of brittle fracture. They found that the behavior of the crystals depended on their orientation and temperature. The addition of nitrogen or carbon, and aging the crystals, increased the range of orientations where the crystals were brittle. This research provides insights into the mechanical properties of iron alloys and the factors affecting brittle fracture.
