tldr: This study compares the lung function of healthy young men from different regions of India, focusing on genetic and environmental factors. The results show that Gurkha highlanders have superior lung function compared to Indian lowlanders, with differences explained by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, such as physical activity during childhood and altitude. The study highlights the importance of understanding these factors for public health and disease prevention.
