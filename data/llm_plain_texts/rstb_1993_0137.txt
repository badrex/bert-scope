tldr: This article discusses the role of the CD4 receptor in HIV entry and the possibility of additional receptors being involved. The authors review evidence suggesting that alternative receptors, such as a serine protease called tryptase TL2, may play a role in HIV entry and tropism. They also highlight differences in entry requirements for HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV, indicating that these viruses may use distinct cell surface molecules during entry.
