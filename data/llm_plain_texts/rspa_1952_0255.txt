tldr: The author investigates the impact of surface structure, composition, and texture on friction under boundary conditions using stainless steel specimens prepared in various ways. They found that surface texture has a significant effect on friction, while the degree of working of the substrate material and the nature of the oxide film also play a role. The study highlights the importance of understanding the factors affecting friction for improving the performance of engineering bearings and other applications.
