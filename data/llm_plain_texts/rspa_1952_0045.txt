tldr: This study investigates the photo-degradation of polymethylmethacrylate, a reverse polymerization reaction, and evaluates the absolute rate constants for a depolymerization reaction. The authors determine the rate of initiation, depropagation, and termination using the rotating-sector technique and a continuously recording Pirani gauge. The results show that tetraphenyl succinodinitrile retards the reaction, providing another way to estimate the rate constants. The findings support the conclusion that a chain reaction is involved in the degradation process, with diphenyl cyano-methyl radicals terminating the chains.
