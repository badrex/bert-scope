tldr: The authors investigated the magnetic properties of various organic crystals and their molecular orientations using magnetic susceptibility measurements. They found that understanding the crystal's structure and molecular orientations can provide valuable information about the orientations of molecules within the crystal lattice. This method can be used to determine molecular orientations more easily and accurately than X-ray methods of analysis. The study also discussed the correlation between the principal magnetic susceptibilities of the crystal and those of individual molecules, which can be useful in understanding the molecular structure and properties of organic compounds.
