tldr: This article explores the origin and naming of the kangaroo, focusing on the work of Sir Joseph Banks during the Endeavour expedition. It examines the local Aboriginal words for various animals and compares them to the words recorded by Banks. The author concludes that the word 'kangaroo' likely refers to the Eastern wallaroo or Eastern grey kangaroo, and discusses the challenges in identifying the exact species due to the scarcity of these animals in the Endeavour River district.
