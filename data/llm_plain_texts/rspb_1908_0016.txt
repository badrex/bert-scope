tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the interaction between small amounts of homologous protein and large amounts of antiserum. They found that the antiserum, rather than the homologous protein, is the main source of "precipitable" substance. The results showed that the antiserum can form deposits many times the weight of the homologous protein, indicating that the antiserum plays a crucial role in precipitin reactions.
