tldr: The authors extend the theory of radio windows in planetary magnetospheres to apply to warm plasmas. They investigate one mechanism for the production of non-thermal continuum radiation in magnetospheric cavities using a warm plasma theory. The study is particularly relevant to the plasmapause and magnetopause, where concentration gradients may be large. The research has implications for various fields, including the Earth's ionosphere, radio emission from the solar corona, and thermonuclear plasmas.
