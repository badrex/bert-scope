tldr: The article presents a detailed study of the random record model, a process of successive upper records in a sequence of independent and identically distributed variates occurring at the points of an independent point process. Asymptotic properties of record and inter-record times, and the number of records in a fixed interval, are derived for both large time intervals and large record index numbers. A generalization permitting some dependence between the variates and the point process is also discussed.
