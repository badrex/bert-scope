tldr: The authors studied the biosynthesis of immunoglobulins, specifically the IgG molecule, in a murine plasmacytoma. They discovered that heavy and light chains are synthesized separately on different-sized polyribosomes. The assembly of the IgG molecule involves the release of light chains into a small pool, which controls the release of heavy chains from polyribosomes. This research provides insights into the complex process of immunoglobulin biosynthesis and assembly.
