tldr: 'Francis Galton examines the registered speeds of American trotting horses to study their heritability and suitability for scientific inquiry into the laws of heredity. He analyzes the data from trotting records and finds that the distribution of speeds follows a normal frequency curve, suggesting that the records are generally trustworthy. Galton also discusses the impact of tolerance for horses that barely qualify for entry and the influence of heredity on horse speeds.'
