tldr: This study investigates the energetic cost of begging in 5 and 10-day-old tree swallow nestlings. The researchers found that begging required 28% more energy than resting, and the energetic cost was not related to begging intensity in 5-day-old nestlings but was significantly related in the older nestlings. The results suggest that the energetic cost of begging may be important when considering the total energy budget of the nestlings.
