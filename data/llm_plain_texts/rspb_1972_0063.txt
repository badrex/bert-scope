tldr: The authors studied the skeletal development in mouse chimaeras produced by fusing embryos with different gene combinations. They examined the effects of the genes'short-ear' and'vestigial-tail' on the skeletons of the chimaeras. The results showed that the chimaeras' skeletal phenotypes were influenced by cell lineage and genetic background, with some chimaeras displaying mild tail anomalies and skeletal features similar to the component strains.
