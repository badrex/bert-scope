tldr: The author examines the circulation of blood in Vermes, a class of animals, and discovers that their circulation is reversed compared to higher classes of animals. This unique circulation allows Vermes to survive in a torpid state and reanimate when conditions are favorable. The author also discusses the different orders within the Vermes class and their distinct methods of aeration and circulation.
