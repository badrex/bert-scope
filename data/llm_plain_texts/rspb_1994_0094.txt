tldr: This study examines the role of serotonin in modulating the swimming activity of post-embryonic Xenopus laevis tadpoles. The researchers found that serotonin acts on 5HT1a receptors to enhance the duration and intensity of motor bursts during swimming. This discovery provides insight into the development and maintenance of a bursty motor pattern in these animals.
