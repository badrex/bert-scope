tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the growth conditions of the Trichophyton tonsurans fungus, which causes ringworm. They found that the fungus grows best in a specific temperature range and requires vitreous humor to thrive. The authors also discovered a bacterium, Bacterium decalvans, associated with hair destruction in alopecia areata, a type of hair loss. This bacterium can be treated to arrest the disease.
