tldr: 'John Rowning presents a design for a compound barometer that allows for increased scale of variation. The new barometer consists of a glass tube filled with mercury, which is immersed in a fluid-filled vessel. The design enables greater sensitivity to atmospheric pressure changes, making it a useful tool for meteorology and scientific research.'
