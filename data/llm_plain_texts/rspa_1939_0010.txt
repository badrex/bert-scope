tldr: The authors studied the emission spectrum of chlorine excited by active nitrogen, focusing on the ultra-violet continua and the associated diffuse bands. They found that the structure in the continuum is due to vibrational transitions, and that both states involved must be stable over a finite range of internuclear distance. The authors also suggested that the upper electronic level of the 2580 Ã… continuum is the corresponding state of chlorine to the level in iodine.
