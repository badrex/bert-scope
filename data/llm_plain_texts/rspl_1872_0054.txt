tldr: The author discusses the importance of regular inspections for iron ships and analyzes the strength and durability of riveted joints. They compare the effectiveness of machine-riveting and hand-riveting, and investigate the impact of drilled and punched holes on the strength of the joints. The author also examines the effect of rounding the edges of rivet-holes on the joint's resistance and shares experimental results and conclusions.
