tldr: 'This study investigates the wetting of leaves by water and how it affects plant physiology. The researchers found that the contact angle of water on a leaf surface varies depending on the leaf's position on the plant and shows a daily fluctuation. These fluctuations are linked to changes in leaf water content. The study also discusses the significance of these phenomena in relation to water retention, exchange of water and dissolved substances between the leaf and water, and stomatal behavior.'
