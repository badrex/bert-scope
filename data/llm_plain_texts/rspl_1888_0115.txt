tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the recalescence of iron and its magnetic properties. They observed a sudden increase in temperature followed by a decrease in the rate of cooling, which they attributed to the liberation of heat due to a change in the iron's state. The author also found that the temperature at which iron ceases to be magnetic coincides with the temperature of recalescence. This research provides insights into the thermal and magnetic properties of iron.
