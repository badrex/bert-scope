tldr: The authors present a refinement of Howard's semicircle theorem for plane flows, merging it with Miles's theorem. They also provide a restriction on unstable modes of a wide class of helical gas flows. This work extends previous theorems and offers a compound form that unites the Miles and Howard bounds to the growth rate of instabilities in parallel flows.
