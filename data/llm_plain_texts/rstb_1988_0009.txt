tldr: This article discusses the biological control of air-borne pathogens affecting plants, focusing on the use of microorganisms to control diseases. It explores various mechanisms, such as competition for nutrients, production of antibiotics, and stimulation of plant defenses. The article also highlights the importance of understanding phylloplane ecology and the potential for combining biological control methods with chemical treatments for more effective disease management.
