tldr: The author describes their observations of the Grotta de Cani, a cave near Naples, Italy, and the effects of the gas emissions on various animals. The gas, similar to mofeta, is heavier than air and spreads out from the cave. It affects animals differently, with dogs and other animals struggling and showing signs of distress, while reptiles and insects seem to hold out longer against the effects of the gas. The author also notes the difference in behavior between the gas in the cave and the gas emissions after volcanic eruptions.
