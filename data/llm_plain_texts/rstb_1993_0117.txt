tldr: This article explores the use of atmospheric general circulation models to simulate the climate of the Jurassic period. The study finds that the models provide first-order agreement with geological data but highlights the limitations due to uncertainties in the models and imposed boundary conditions. The results suggest that the warmth of high latitudes is influenced by changing sea ice and cloud cover, and the oceanic heat transports are relatively small.
