tldr: The authors discovered that an intracellular symbiont found in cockroaches belongs to the flavobacteria-bacteroides phylum. They analyzed the small subunit ribosomal DNA of these bacteria to investigate their phylogeny and found that the endosymbionts of five cockroach species make up a coherent group with no close relatives within the eubacterial phylum defined by the flavobacteria. This finding sheds light on the relationships between the endosymbionts and their host taxonomic relationships.
