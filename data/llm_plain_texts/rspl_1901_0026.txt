tldr: 'This study investigates the anatomy of symmetrical double monstrosities in trout embryos, examining the fusion, disappearance, or adaptation of parts in the region of transition from the double to the single condition. The research covers various aspects of the monstrosities, including the cranial, visceral, and vertebral skeletons, as well as the development of organs and systems. The findings contribute to the understanding of developmental biology and embryology, particularly in fish species.'
