tldr: The study investigates the relationship between atmospheric CO2 changes and stomatal density in the arctic-alpine shrub Salix herbacea over a 11,500-year period using fossil leaves from post-glacial deposits. Contrary to shorter-term observations, the research found that the rising CO2 concentration in the past 11,500 years has led to an increase in stomatal density in S. herbacea. The results suggest that factors like temperature and water availability in the early post-glacial environment may have influenced the plant's response to lower CO2 levels.
