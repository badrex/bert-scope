tldr: The authors study the behavior of a sound pulse approaching and progressing beyond the open end of a semi-infinite channel. They discuss the creation of a succession of diffracted waves and obtain a general formula for the pulse originating inside the channel. The study also covers the returning wave's form when the pulse approaches the open end from an arbitrary direction. The authors provide explicit expressions for the potential in the first two regions at the head of the returning wave and the third region when the pulse originates inside the channel.
