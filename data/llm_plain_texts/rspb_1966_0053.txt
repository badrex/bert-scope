tldr: This study investigates the fine structure and connections of the hyponeural tissue in the lantern of Echinus esculentus. The hyponeural tissue is a complex mass of interwoven nerve fibers, and it plays a crucial role in the innervation of the lantern muscles. The researchers used various methods, including electron microscopy, to analyze the tissue's structure and connections. The findings provide new insights into the echinoderm nervous system and its muscular structures.
