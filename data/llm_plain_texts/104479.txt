tldr: Gowin Knight conducted experiments with variously shaped magnets to demonstrate the manipulability of magnetic poles. He created magnets with opposite poles on opposite ends, sides, and even in the middle. These experiments showed the limitations of existing hypotheses about the behavior of magnets and loadstones.
