  - Earth's Density
  - Continental Elevation
tldr: The author uses spherical harmonics to analyze the shape and density of the Earth's surface, focusing on continental elevations and oceanic depressions. They create a chart to represent the Earth's shape using a formula with coefficients, which helps improve the accuracy of the representation.
