tldr: The author examines the process of embryonic fission in Lichenopora verrucaria, a type of Cyclostomatous Polyzoa. They describe the colony's growth, the formation of zooecia and ovicells, and the development of embryos. The study reveals that Lichenopora undergoes a unique fission process, which is more similar to the fission of "Urknospen" in certain Tunicata than the process in Grisia.
