tldr: The author investigates the use of an electrical method called "blaze current" to estimate the vitality of seeds. They found that fresh seeds produce a strong blaze current, while boiled or deteriorated seeds do not. This method can be used to compare seed vitality and germination rates, potentially improving seed selection and agricultural practices.
