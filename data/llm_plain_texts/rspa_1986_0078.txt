tldr: The authors study the ordered defects and structural changes in uranium oxides, particularly in uranium dioxide (UO2). They investigate the interaction between interstitial defects and the formation of clusters in the hyperstoichiometric phases U409 and U307. The research also explores the relationship between the fluorite structure and the orthorhombic structure in the uranium-oxygen system, providing insights into the oxidation behavior of UO2.
