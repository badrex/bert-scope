tldr: The article discusses the resistance of potato tissue to the growth of fungal pathogens, particularly Phytophthora infestans. It explores the mechanisms of resistance, including the hypersensitive reaction, and the role of phenolic compounds like lignin and terpenoid compounds in defending against infection. The study also highlights the importance of understanding the interactions between host factors and the growth and development of pathogens to improve disease resistance in potato plants.
