tldr: The author, Thomas Andrews, investigated the conflicting views on the constitution of ozone and conducted experiments to determine its properties. He found that ozone, regardless of its source, is one and the same substance and is an allotropic form of oxygen. Ozone is destroyed at a temperature of about 2370Â°C or when passed over peroxide of manganese, and it has a unique odor and bleaching properties.
