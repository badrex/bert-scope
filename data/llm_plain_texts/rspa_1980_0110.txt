tldr: The authors apply the Wigner-Eisenbud matrix theory to study inelastic collision processes between atoms and diatomic molecules. They develop a method to calculate the total cross sections at various energy points and compare it with conventional coupled-channel calculations, finding essentially exact agreement. The study contributes to understanding collisional relaxation processes and their role in various physical phenomena, such as pressure-broadened spectral line shapes and gas laser efficiency.
