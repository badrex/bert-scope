revised_title: 'Parasitic Dwarf Males in Oceanic Angler-Fishes'

  - Dwarf males
tldr: The author discovered that in certain species of anglerfish, the males become parasitic and attach themselves to the females. These dwarf males have a unique structure and lack some features of the adult fish. The connection between the male and female is external, and the author speculates that this unusual reproductive strategy may be useful for the survival of the offspring, although the exact purpose and mechanism remain unclear.
