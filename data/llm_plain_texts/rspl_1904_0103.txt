tldr: This study compares the sucroclastic action of acids and enzymes in hydrolyzing cane sugar. The authors found that both acid and enzyme action follow a similar pattern, with the change initially being approximately linear with time and later becoming a logarithmic function. The results support the association theory of hydrolysis, which explains the observed phenomena in acid and enzyme action. The influence of the products of the change on the reaction rate is also investigated, showing that the molecular effect of cane sugar is about twice that of glucose or fructose.
