tldr: The authors studied the magnetic properties of Apollo 12 lunar samples and found that the fines contain at least 0.7% by mass of native iron, mainly in the super-paramagnetic form at room temperature. The crystalline rocks possess an intermediate-stable natural remanent magnetization, indicating the presence of a magnetic field on the Moon at the time of rock formation. The Moon likely had an internal magnetic field 3400 million years ago, which has since decayed.
