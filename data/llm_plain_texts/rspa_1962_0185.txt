tldr: The authors studied the mechanism of chemiluminescent combination reactions involving oxygen atoms. They measured the intensities of chemiluminescent emissions in the reactions and found that the process proceeds via three-body processes. The results provide information about the formation of excited molecules in chemiluminescent reactions and help establish the role of third bodies in the reaction, particularly oxygen, which has a triplet ground state.
