tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the volume of emanation produced from a known weight of radium bromide and the quantity of helium resulting from the spontaneous change of the emanation. They used special apparatus and techniques to collect and analyze the gases, finding that the helium spectrum increased in brilliancy when cooled. The research helped to understand the connection between helium, uranium, and thorium and their radioactivity.
