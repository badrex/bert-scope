tldr: This article compares the fluctuations of the Earth's magnetic declination at Kew and Stonyhurst observatories during 1883 and 1884. The authors analyze the measurements to understand the relationship between the magnetic disturbances and their possible causes, such as true magnetic changes and secondary currents. They also discuss the methods used for comparing the observations and the implications of their findings.
