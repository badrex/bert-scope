tldr: The author examines the structure, physiology, and development of Antedon rosaceus, focusing on its nervous system and swimming mechanism. Through a series of experiments, the author confirms that the quinquelocular organ, located in the centro-dorsal basin, serves as the center of the nervous system, coordinating the movements of the arms. The author also refutes the idea that Ludwig's "nerve" is related to the swimming movements, as experiments show that it has no immediate connection to them.
