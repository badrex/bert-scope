revised_title: The Dual Origin of Mammalia and its Implications on Tooth Structure
semantic_tags:
  - Evolution
  - Mammalian dentition
  - Ornithodelphia
  - Sauropsida
  - Reptilian teeth
tldr: The author examines the tooth structure of Ornithodelphia, specifically Ornithorhynchus, and compares it to Sauropsida and other reptiles. They find that the teeth of Ornithorhynchus are distinctly mammalian, suggesting that the dual origin theory of mammals may be incorrect. The author also discusses the possibility of Monotremes being an example of degradation and reversion, rather than a separate evolutionary branch.
