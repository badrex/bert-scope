tldr: The author investigates the mechanism of diamond abrasion and finds that the ease of abrasion depends on the crystallography of the diamond. They propose a thermal theory to explain the anisotropy in abrasion resistance, suggesting that high sliding speeds introduce a thermally activated chemical effect. The author also studies the friction between diamond surfaces and examines the tracks produced by sliding diamond on diamond, providing evidence supporting the thermal abrasion mechanism.
