tldr: The author investigates the propagation of surface elastic waves in cubic crystals, specifically Rayleigh and Love waves. They find that these waves exist in certain symmetrical cases and demonstrate their properties, such as the motion of particles in a plane inclined to the direction of propagation. The study has implications for understanding seismic waves and the behavior of elastic media.
