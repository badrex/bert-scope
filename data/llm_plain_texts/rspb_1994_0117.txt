tldr: The article explores the process of depth perception using two eyes, known as stereopsis. It explains how the brain processes the slightly dissimilar images from each eye to create a three-dimensional view of the world. The author discusses the limitations of using binocular parallax for depth judgment and the importance of disparity in depth perception. The article also highlights the psychophysics of spatial vision and the methods used to study stereopsis.
