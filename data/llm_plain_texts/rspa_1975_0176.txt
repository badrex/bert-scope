tldr: The authors present a method called the 'composite flux' approach to simplify the solution of multi-radical, one-dimensional, premixed laminar flame problems. This method uses partial equilibrium or quasi-steady state assumptions to reduce the number of independent working conditions and avoid'stiffness' problems. The authors discuss the application of this approach in hydrogen and hydrocarbon flames, highlighting its potential to improve the understanding of flame structure and reaction kinetics.
