tldr: The authors studied the decomposition of nitrous oxide catalyzed by palladium-gold alloy wires. They found that the reaction is first-order and is influenced by the presence of oxygen. The study provides insights into the role of electronic factors in catalysis and offers a steady-state treatment for the dissociative chemisorption of nitrous oxide, which is in agreement with the experimental results.
