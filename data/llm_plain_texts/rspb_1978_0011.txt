tldr: The dorsal eye of the mayfly Atalophlebia is unique due to its sensitivity to ultraviolet light and the candelabra-shaped rhabdom structure. The crystalline cone is surrounded by a yellow pigment, which prevents the formation of a superposition image. Instead, the researchers suggest that ultraviolet rays are sharply focused on the cone tip and conducted by the retinula cell columns acting as light guides across the clear zone. This method enhances the sensitivity of the eye and is crucial for the mayfly's ability to capture females.
