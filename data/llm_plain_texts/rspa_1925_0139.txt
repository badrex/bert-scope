tldr: The authors used theoretical calculations to determine the physical properties of certain crystals, focusing on interatomic forces and the inverse power law. They found that neon-like ions repel according to an inverse 11th power, while argon-like ions repel according to an inverse 9th power. This research helps explain observed interatomic distances in crystals and provides a better understanding of crystal properties.
