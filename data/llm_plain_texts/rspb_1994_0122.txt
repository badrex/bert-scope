tldr: The article investigates the dynamics of a resistant and susceptible strain of a self-regulated host species in the presence of a directly transmitted pathogen. The strains trade off differences in pathogen transmissibility against differences in birth rate and/or resistance to crowding. Depending on parameter values, either strain may be eliminated, or the two may coexist with the pathogen. Coexistence requires a balance between the strains' advantages, and resistance is most likely to evolve in hosts with characteristics of many insect pests.
