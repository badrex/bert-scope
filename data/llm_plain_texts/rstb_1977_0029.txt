tldr: This article discusses the essential role of water in maintaining the structural integrity and function of proteins. It explores the various states of water molecules in proteins, including strongly bound, localized water and more labile, liquid-like water. The article also highlights the importance of the hydration shell, which is thought to play a significant role in protein stability and dynamics. Researchers combine experimental techniques to better understand the complex interactions between proteins and water, aiming to predict long-term properties of these systems based on molecular-level events.
