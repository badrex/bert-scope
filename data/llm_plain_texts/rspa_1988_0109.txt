tldr: The authors apply calculations in stochastic geometry to analyze the distribution of fission tracks in apatite crystals when information is available only by plane sampling. They focus on the effect of anisotropy, which is the dependence of track length on orientation. Using a realistic Poisson line-segment model, they obtain formulae for the density of line segments intersecting a plane and for the length distributions of confined tracks, semi-tracks, and projected semi-tracks in terms of the conditional distribution of length given orientation. These formulae help explain and quantify the anisotropic effect observed in experimental data from fission track annealing studies.
