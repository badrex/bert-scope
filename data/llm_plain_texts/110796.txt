tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the properties of substances that exhibit elliptic polarization when reflecting light. They examined various materials, including mica, decomposed glass, plumbago, and metallic plates, and observed changes in the form of the rings that corresponded to the increments in the retardation of the periodical colors of the films. The paper also describes the apparatus and methods used in the experiments.
