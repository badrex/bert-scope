tldr: This study investigates how particles disperse in the recirculation zone formed downstream of an axisymmetric sudden expansion. The results show that large eddies play a significant role in particle dispersion, while other factors such as particle transit time, centrifugal effects, and particle mass loading also influence the process. The study provides a framework for understanding and quantifying particle dispersion in various technological applications, including combustion in industrial burners and internal combustion engines.
