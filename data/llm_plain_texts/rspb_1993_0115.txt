tldr: The authors investigated how snail neurons regulate intracellular calcium levels using voltage-clamped neurons and calcium-sensitive microelectrodes. They discovered that calcium recovery after an increase coincides with a decrease in surface hydrogen ions. The calcium-hydrogen exchange is blocked by intracellular vanadate, suggesting that snail neurons mainly regulate intracellular calcium using a vanadate-sensitive Ca-H pump.
