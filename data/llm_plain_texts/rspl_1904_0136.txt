tldr: This article investigates the relationship between daily barometric heights at stations over 1000 miles apart, focusing on the influence of the time factor on their correlation. The author uses the method of correlation to predict barometric conditions at one station based on observations from another station. The study finds that the maximum correlation between stations occurs at different intervals during summer and winter months, and that the time factor plays a significant role in predicting barometric pressure.
