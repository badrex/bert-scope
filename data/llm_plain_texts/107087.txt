tldr: The author, Richard Walker, discusses the experiments conducted by him and Henry Cavendish on the production of artificial cold using muriate of lime. They found that mixing muriate of lime with snow could produce a temperature as low as -48 degrees Celsius. The experiments showed that muriate of lime could be used to freeze mercury and that it was more effective than nitrous acid and snow in producing cold. The author also provides instructions on how to prepare muriate of lime for use in producing artificial cold.
