tldr: The article investigates the electrophysiological behavior of plasma membranes in endosperm protoplasts from higher plants. It describes the characteristics of a non-selective monovalent cation channel with a single-channel conductance of 22 pS, which is activated by calcium and voltage changes. The channel plays a role in cell division and cellular polarity in plants.
