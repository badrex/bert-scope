tldr: This article discusses the distribution of stress in aeolotropic plates with hyperbolic notches under tension or flexure. The authors present a theoretical analysis and numerical calculations for a spruce wood plank, comparing the results with those of an isotropic material. The study aims to determine the type of failure expected near notches in stressed wooden members, which is essential for understanding the behavior of wooden structures in engineering applications.
