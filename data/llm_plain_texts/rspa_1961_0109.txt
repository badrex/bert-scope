tldr: This lecture by Sir Lawrence Bragg reviews the development of X-ray analysis from its beginnings in 1912 to the mid-20th century. He discusses the key advances and contributions that shaped the field, including the use of Fourier series, the phase problem, and the development of X-ray diffraction machines. Bragg highlights the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and the role of chance in scientific discovery.
