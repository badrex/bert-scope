tldr: The article discusses the functional architecture of the prefrontal cortex and its role in human cognition and the central executive. It argues that the prefrontal cortex has a generic function, which is the "on-line" processing of information or working memory, and that this process is iteratively represented throughout several subdivisions of the prefrontal neopallium. The different areas within the prefrontal cortex represent iterations of this function for different information domains, including spatial cognition, object cognition, and semantic processing.
