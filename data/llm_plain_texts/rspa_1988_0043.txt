tldr: This article presents a study on the kinetics of polymer crystallization, focusing on the growth of lamellar crystals by chain folding of polymer molecules. The authors describe the process using Markov rate processes and discuss the equilibrium distributions for hexagonal and square crystal structures. They also examine the continuum limit of these models and compare them to existing growth models.
