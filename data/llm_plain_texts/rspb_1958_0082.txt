tldr: The author discusses the cellular location of fat synthesizing enzymes in lactation. They suggest that the DPNH-utilizing system is located in the soluble fraction of the cell, while the TPNH-utilizing system is located in the microsomes. The author also mentions recent studies that show the inclusion of phosphate buffer in the homogenization medium can release enzymes from the mitochondria, which are required for fatty-acid synthesis.
