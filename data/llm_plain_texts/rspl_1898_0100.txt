tldr: This article investigates the types of wave motion in the vicinity of a theoretical Hertzian oscillator with damped intensity. The authors find that three waves of electromagnetic force are sent out from the oscillator, and they study the velocities and phases of these waves. They also discuss the effects of damping on the wave train and its influence on Hertz's interference experiments.
