tldr: This article discusses the complex composition of Southeast Asia, which consists of allochthonous continental fragments, subduction complexes, and small ocean basins. The author presents a review of the origin, processes, and accretion history of these continental terranes, which are derived from Gondwana-Land and assembled between the Carboniferous and the late Triassic. The article also explores the various terranes added to the cratonic core of Southeast Asia during the Mesozoic and the modifications that occurred due to plate tectonics.
