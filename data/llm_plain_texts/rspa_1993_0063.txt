tldr: This study investigates the dehydrations of potassium chrome alum and potassium aluminum alum, examining the kinetics and mechanisms involved. The authors found that the Avrami-Erofe'ev equations describe the reaction, and the dehydration process involves nucleation and growth. The retention of water in the vicinity of the reactant solid influences the course of interface generation and development during the early stages of dehydration. The findings contribute to the understanding of dehydration kinetics and the development of theoretical foundations for rate expressions used in solid-state reactions.
