tldr: This study investigates the effects of cerebral anemia and ligation of cerebral arteries on animal behavior and brain function. The research shows that immobilization in an erect posture can cause cerebral anemia, leading to convulsions, paralysis, and failure of respiration in rabbits. Dogs, cats, and monkeys are less affected due to better abdominal muscle tone. The study also demonstrates that the cortex cerebri remains excitable even after carotid and vertebral arteries have been tied, but the animals become demented, anaesthetized, and paralyzed due to the lack of blood supply. The research concludes that the functions of the brain can continue even with a significant decrease in blood flow, and efficient anastomosis can restore brain function.
