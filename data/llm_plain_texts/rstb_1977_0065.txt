tldr: This article discusses the importance of meteorological measurements and the development of models to understand the relationship between weather and agricultural systems in semi-arid lands within the tropics. The authors explore the use of statistical and heuristic models to analyze weather variables and their impact on crop yields, emphasizing the need for more research and better understanding of the complex relationships between weather, crops, and agricultural systems in these regions.
