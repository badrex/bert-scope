tldr: This article examines low-pressure regional metamorphism in the Pyrenees during the Hercynian orogeny. The study suggests that exceptionally high thermal gradients existed within the upper crust, with temperatures as high as 700°C attained at depths as shallow as 10 km, resulting in large-scale crustal anatexis. The tectonic setting best suited to explain the metamorphic phenomena in the Hercynian of the Pyrenees is that of rifted continental crust, with a transient, high-temperature heat source in the lower crust required to account for the observed metamorphic arrays.
