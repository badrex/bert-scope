tldr: This article suggests that cross-bridge attachment during muscle contraction may occur in two stages. The first stage is easily and rapidly reversible, while the second stage involves a limited range of relative positions between the cross-bridge and thin-filament site. This two-stage attachment process explains the decline in energy release at high contraction speeds, which was previously unaccounted for in one-stage attachment models.
