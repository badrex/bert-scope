tldr: The authors investigated the thermal conductivities of various organic vapours and found that some vapours showed a significant increase in conductivity with pressure, while others exhibited non-linear increases due to association to polymers. The results suggest that the differences in behaviour between the vapours are due to their association or non-association. The study provides insights into the relationship between gas imperfection, pressure, and temperature effects on thermal conductivity.
