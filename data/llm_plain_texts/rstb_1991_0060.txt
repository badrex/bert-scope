tldr: This study examines the effectiveness of various regimens of occlusion, including full-time and part-time reverse occlusion, on the recovery of vision in monocularly deprived kittens. The results show that certain intermediate occlusion times of the non-deprived eye led to recovery of normal acuities, contrast sensitivity, and vernier acuity in both eyes. The study also explores factors that contribute to the success of these regimens and their potential implications for the clinical treatment of amblyopia in humans.
