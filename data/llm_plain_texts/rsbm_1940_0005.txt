tldr: "The article is an obituary for William McDougall, a prominent figure in psychology and physiology. McDougall made significant contributions to the study of vision, particularly color vision, and was a part of the Cambridge Anthropological Expedition to the Torres Straits. He later worked on sense physiology and psychology, focusing on the psychological aspects of his research after 1912. Despite facing controversy and unorthodox views, McDougall's work laid the foundation for future research in the field."
