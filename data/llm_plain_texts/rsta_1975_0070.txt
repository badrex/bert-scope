tldr: This study examines the ultraviolet spectrum of the Be star Tauri to understand its atmospheric properties and mass ejection mechanisms. The analysis reveals strong absorption lines in the ultraviolet region, which help determine the star's atmospheric parameters. The findings also suggest that the extended atmosphere of Tauri, both the shell of a Be star and the envelope of a supergiant, can be indicated by these absorption features.
