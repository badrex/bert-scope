tldr: This study investigates the position at which a burning gas mixture would develop a detonation wave under certain fixed conditions. The authors examined the influence of the strength of the combustible gas mixture, the nature of the diluent gas, and the addition of small quantities of certain "antiknock" compounds. The research focused on acetylene and pentane gas mixtures, and the findings provide insights into the behavior of combustion and detonation in closed and open tubes.
