tldr: The author investigates the mathematical consequences of the theory of two magnetic poles within the Earth and explores the various features of terrestrial magnetism, such as the magnetic equator, vertical points, and isodynamic lines. The study aims to determine the accuracy of the dual pole hypothesis and its compatibility with observed phenomena, ultimately contributing to a better understanding of Earth's magnetic field.
