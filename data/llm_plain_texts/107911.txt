tldr: The author investigates the stability and perturbations of planetary systems, providing expressions for the variations of elliptic constants and demonstrating that eccentricity, major axis, and orbital inclination contain no time-varying terms. The study also considers the effects of a resisting medium on planetary motion and the resulting periodic inequalities.
