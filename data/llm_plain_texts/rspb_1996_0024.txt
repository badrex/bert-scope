tldr: 'This study investigates whether flocking has a navigational function for pigeons. The researchers manipulated the navigational experience of pigeons and found that locally inexperienced pigeons tended to follow experienced pigeons, while experienced pigeons were more likely to stay together. The results suggest that flocking may not have a navigational function, but rather, pigeons may use flocking to gather navigational information or learn from experienced individuals.'
