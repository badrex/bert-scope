tldr: This article presents a new approach to understanding optical activity in molecules using scattering matrix techniques. The authors apply this method to non-degenerate subsystems interacting in the dipole approximation and demonstrate that retardation effects are negligible. This theory provides a physically appealing interpretation of the 'coupled oscillator' terms in the expression and does not rely on the Rosenfeld equation for the rotation angle.
