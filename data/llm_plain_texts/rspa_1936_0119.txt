tldr: This article investigates the transition between the supraconductive and normal states in mercury, focusing on magnetic induction. The authors found that the transition occurs within a narrow range of magnetic field strength and temperature, and that the induced magnetic moment reaches a final value only after a considerable time in the transition region. This research contributes to the understanding of the behavior of metals in extreme conditions and the potential applications of supraconductivity.
