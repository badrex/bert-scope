tldr: This study investigates the rate of cosmic-ray bursts and the spread of showers in large lead thicknesses. The authors found that the burst-rate curves for lead show a gradual increase towards a second maximum at large thicknesses. The research also provides information about the average angular spread of showers and the increase in shower spread with increasing shower size.
