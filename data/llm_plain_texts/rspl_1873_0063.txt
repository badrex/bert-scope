tldr: This article discusses the author's experiments with sodium vapor using spectroscopy and the analysis of alleged lemming remains found in cave deposits in England. The author concludes that the remains are actually from a Pika, or tailless Hare, and not a Lemming. The spectroscopy experiments reveal the absorption and emission spectrum of sodium vapor, providing insights into the properties of the element.
