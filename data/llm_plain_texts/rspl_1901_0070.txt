tldr: This report presents the magnetical observations conducted at Falmouth Observatory for the year 1900. The observations include hourly readings of the photographic curves, which are corrected for diurnal variations. The results are deduced from magnetograph curves and are used to calculate the Declination, Horizontal Force, and Inclination. The data is analyzed to determine the magnetic diurnal variations and the Earth's magnetic field during that time period.
