tldr: This book review discusses the transformation of the Royal Society in the 19th century, as it shifted from a diverse group of individuals interested in natural knowledge to a society composed mainly of professional scientists. The author highlights the factors that contributed to this change, such as the formation of specialist scientific societies and the Society's role in providing expert advice to the government. The review also explores the consequences of this transformation and the impact on the broader interests of the Society and the role of science in society.
