tldr: The article discusses the application of Whitham theory to study nonlinear wave propagation in dispersive systems. The author explores various special cases, including unidirectional waves on deep water, and compares the theory's predictions with experimental results. The Whitham theory provides a valuable tool for understanding wave behavior in complex systems, but further research is needed to determine its range of applicability and to address the challenges posed by many-valued solutions.
