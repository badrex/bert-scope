tldr: The authors study the dynamics of a heavy classical system coupled to a classical or quantal fast system and derive the first-order velocity-dependent corrections to the lowest adiabatic approximation for the reaction force. They discover two first-order forces: geometric magnetism and deterministic friction. Geometric magnetism is related to the geometric phase, while deterministic friction arises from the chaotic motion of the fast system.
