tldr: The Osteno fossiliferous formation in Lombardy, Italy, contains a unique and well-preserved Jurassic-era fossil collection. The Sinemurian deposit's exceptional preservation is due to a metasomatic process that replaced organic material with colloidal calcium phosphate. The fossils, including crustaceans, cephalopods, polychaetes, and fish, provide valuable insights into the ancient ecosystem and sedimentary environment.
