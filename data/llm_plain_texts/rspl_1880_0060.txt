tldr: This article discusses the experiments conducted by Mr. Crookes on the decrement of the arc of vibration of a mica plate oscillating within a bulb containing different gas pressures. Professor Stokes analyzes the results and explains how the viscosity of gases can be determined by the log decrement of the arc of vibration. The study also confirms Maxwell's law, which states that the viscosity of a gas is independent of pressure.
