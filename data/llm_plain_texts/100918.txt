tldr: Dr. Kerkringius observed and described the presence of eggs in females, including their size, composition, and role in human development. He found that these eggs contain a glutinous liquid and are covered by two membranes. The discovery of these eggs in both married and unmarried women led to further inquiry into their use in the process of generation.
