tldr: The author, Joseph Priestley, conducted experiments on different kinds of air, focusing on fixed air. He discovered that fixed air is expelled by heat from lime and other calcareous substances, and is also present in alkaline salts and fermenting vegetables. Fixed air, when combined with water, gives it the properties of Pyrmont-water. Priestley also found that fixed air can be used to create a type of water that dissolves iron, potentially aiding in the prevention or treatment of scurvy.
