tldr: The authors conducted a three-dimensional X-ray study of the crystal and molecular structure of quaterrylene, a homologue of perylene. They found that the average length of the six peri-bonds is 1.465(5) Å, which can be divided into two chemically equivalent sets with an average length of 1.462(6) Å for the four outer bonds and 1.468(6) Å for the central pair. The crystal contains dimers consisting of two centro-symmetrically related molecules separated by a mean perpendicular distance of 3.0 Å, which is smaller than the corresponding separation in perylene and approaches the interlayer spacing in graphite.
