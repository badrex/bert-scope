tldr: The authors analyze the interaction energies between optically active molecules, focusing on dispersion and induction energies. They discuss the differences in interaction between dextro and laevo molecules and provide formulas for various types of interactions, including resonance interactions. The study has implications for understanding pairwise interactions and crystalline systems of optically active molecules.
