tldr: The author, Charles Lyttelton, discovered a unique petrified insect fossil in limestone pits at Dudley in Worcestershire. He submitted the specimen to the Royal Society for classification, as the fossil's appearance was not previously documented by British writers and only vaguely described by foreign lithographers. The fossil's classification remains uncertain, with some suggesting it is an Eruca or a Bivalve.
