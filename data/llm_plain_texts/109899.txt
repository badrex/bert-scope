tldr: The author, T.A. Knight, explores the function of heart wood in trees and suggests that it serves as a winter reservoir for organizable matter. He also proposes that the tree's bark provides the necessary fluid for this process. Knight argues against the idea that sap ascends through the heart wood and instead believes that it moves through the bark and convergent cellular processes.
