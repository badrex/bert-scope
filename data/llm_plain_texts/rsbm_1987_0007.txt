tldr: 'Frank Dickens was a prominent biochemist and organic chemist who made significant contributions to insulin production and medical research. Born in Northampton, he studied at Northampton Grammar School and Magdalene College, Cambridge. After working at Imperial College London, he joined Dr. E. C. Dodds at the Middlesex Hospital to develop a new method for insulin extraction and purification. This method laid the foundation for the commercial production of insulin. Dickens's expertise in organic chemistry greatly influenced his work in biochemistry, and he believed that biochemical research should be based on a solid chemical foundation.'
