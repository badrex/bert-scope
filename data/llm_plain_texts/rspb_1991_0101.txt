tldr: The authors analyze the maturation of the humoral immune response as an optimization problem, focusing on the efficiency of response to a single antigenic challenge. They demonstrate that a 'bang-bang' strategy, with discontinuous transitions from minimum to maximum mutation rate, is optimal for a fast production of high-affinity antibodies. This strategy is supported by mathematical theory and is in accordance with biological observations concerning the time of onset of the mutation process and the mutation rate during the immune response.
