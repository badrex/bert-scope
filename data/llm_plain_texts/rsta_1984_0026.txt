tldr: This article discusses the formation and transformation of clay minerals in rocks and soils through three mechanisms: inheritance, neoformation, and transformation. It explores how these mechanisms operate in different geological environments, such as weathering, sedimentary, and diagenetic-hydrothermal environments, and how they influence the mineralogy of clays. The article also highlights the importance of soil-solution chemistry and environmental factors in determining the formation of clay minerals and their implications in geology and paleoclimate studies.
