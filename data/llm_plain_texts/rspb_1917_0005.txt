revised_title: 'The Respiratory Process in Muscle and the Nature of Muscular Motion: A Reevaluation of the Inogen Theory'
semantic_tags:
  - Muscle physiology
  - Cellular respiration
  - Biochemistry
  - Muscle energy
  - Inogen theory
tldr: The author examines the respiratory process in muscles and challenges the widely accepted inogen theory, which states that muscular energy comes from the breakdown of a molecular complex containing oxygen. The author's experiments on isolated frog muscles show that the production of carbon dioxide does not increase during muscle contraction, contradicting the inogen theory. This study calls for a reevaluation of the understanding of cellular respiration and muscle energy.
