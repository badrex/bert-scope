tldr: The authors propose a mathematical model that combines a Hookean spring, an Eyring dashpot, and a rubber elasticity spring to describe the isothermal stress-strain curves in glassy thermoplastics. The model helps explain the large recoverable extensions observed in high polymers below their glass transition points and provides a better understanding of the deformation and fracture behavior of plastics.
