tldr: This article investigates second-order linear differential equations with two turning points, focusing on large values of a real parameter. The author applies the Liouville transformation to convert the differential equation into one of four standard forms with continuous coefficients. Asymptotic approximations are constructed using parabolic cylinder functions, which are valid for large values of the parameter and are uniform with respect to the parameter and the turning points. The paper also includes new properties of parabolic cylinder functions.
