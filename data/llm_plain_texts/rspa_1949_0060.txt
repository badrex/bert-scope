tldr: The authors studied the growth of cubic sodium chlorate crystals from aqueous solutions and measured the rates of advance of individual faces. They found that the concentration at the crystal surface is not always at saturation, and that the facial rate of growth depends on both diffusion and other factors. The results challenge the Nernst and Berthoud assumptions and provide insights into crystal growth processes.
