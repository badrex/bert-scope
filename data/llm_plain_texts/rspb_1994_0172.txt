tldr: 'Female zebra finches prefer to display more and for longer in front of males with symmetric chest plumage, according to a study by John P. Swaddle and Innes C. Cuthill. The researchers manipulated the asymmetry of chest bars in male zebra finches and found that females chose to display more around males with symmetric chest plumage. This suggests that females may use symmetry as an indicator of male quality when choosing a mate.'
