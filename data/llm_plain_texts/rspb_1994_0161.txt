tldr: The author discovered that a parasitic fungus, Entomophthora muscae, infecting yellow dungflies directly manipulates the host's perching behavior. Infected dungflies perch abnormally in a specific manner to help the fungus with spore dispersal and host infection. This is a remarkable example of a parasitic organism manipulating its host's behavior for its own benefit.
