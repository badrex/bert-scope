tldr: The Royal Society Expedition to North Borneo in 1961 focused on understanding the geological and botanical aspects of the region, particularly the rise of Mt Kinabalu. The discussion covered various theories, including the diapyrie theory of the mountain's formation. The biologists and geologists agreed that further investigation of older interior mountains in Borneo is necessary for a better understanding of the region's flora and fauna. The expedition also left behind an aluminum portable hut named "Burlington House" for future ecological studies.
