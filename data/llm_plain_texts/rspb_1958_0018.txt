tldr: The study examines the amino acid composition of the developing cuticle and puparium of the insect Calliphora vomitoria. It reveals changes in amino acid composition during development, with phenylalanine and para-tyrosine disappearing during puparium hardening, suggesting they combine with tanning quinone. The presence of ortho-tyrosine and the extraction of larval cuticles with water indicate that aromatic amino acids may be metabolized in the cuticle, giving rise to hydroxylated products.
