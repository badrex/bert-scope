tldr: The article presents in situ transmission electron microscope measurements of solid Al-solid Pb and solid Al-liquid Pb surface-energy anisotropy in rapidly solidified Al-5% Pb alloy. The experiments monitor the shape of Pb particles embedded in Al and use the Gibbs-Wulff theorem to determine the anisotropy of Al-Pb surface energy over a range of temperatures above and below the melting point of Pb.
