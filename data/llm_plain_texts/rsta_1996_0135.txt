tldr: The article studies the effects of surface-tension anisotropy on interface morphology during directional solidification of a binary alloy. The authors generalize the long-wave evolution equation to include anisotropic surface energy and analyze the pattern-selection problem for different growth directions. Anisotropy influences the existence, stability, and bifurcation criteria for various patterns, leading to changes in pattern selection and imperfect bifurcations.
