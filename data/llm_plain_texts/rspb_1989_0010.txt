tldr: This study compares the competitive responses of Atlantic salmon adopting different life-history strategies. The research shows that slow-developing salmon have a higher failure rate in competing for food when faced with a competitor, while fast-developing salmon remain unaffected. The findings suggest that slow-developing salmon may have a disadvantage in terms of survival and growth due to their lower competitive ability.
