tldr: The authors classify the states of the nuclear f-shell using group theory and quantum mechanics. They predict the ground states of even-even, even-odd, and odd-odd nuclei based on short-range forces. The results align with the shell model of nuclear structure proposed by Mayer and Haxel, Jensen, and Suess. The study suggests the possibility of isomerism in some nuclei.
