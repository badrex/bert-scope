tldr: The study investigates the effect of a metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist, ( + )-l-aminocyclopentane-trans-l,3-dicarboxylic acid (inms-ACPD), on excitatory post-synaptic currents (epscs) in neurons of rat visual cortex. The results show that ACPD presynaptically suppresses epscs, and this suppression is mediated by a 4-aminopyridine (4-AP)-sensitive mechanism.
