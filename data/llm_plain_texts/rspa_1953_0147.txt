tldr: The author investigates the production of mesons and the localization of field energy in high-energy collisions between nucleons. They analyze the distribution of a nucleon's mass between its proper mass and field mass, showing that this distribution plays a crucial role in determining the outcome of very energetic collisions. The study of meson production in high-energy encounters can provide a method of obtaining information on the contribution of the meson field to the rest mass of a nucleon and the localization of this energy in the meson field.
