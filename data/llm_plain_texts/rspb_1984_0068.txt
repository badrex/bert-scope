tldr: Researchers discovered a calcium-activated cation-selective channel in rat Schwann cells using the patch-clamp technique. The channel has a single-channel conductance of 32 and is equally permeable to sodium and potassium ions. The channel's activity is sensitive to voltage and is activated by high calcium concentrations. This finding contributes to the understanding of membrane properties in Schwann cells and their potential role in nerve regeneration.
