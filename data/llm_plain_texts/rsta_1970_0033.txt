tldr: The author conducted marine magnetic measurements across the axial trough of the Red Sea and found that the magnetic anomalies support a rifting origin for the trough. The study confirms previous hypotheses that strongly magnetic rocks underlie the axial trough and provides various seafloor spreading models that could account for the inferred motion. The results reveal a remarkable similarity between the axial trough and mid-ocean ridge crests.
