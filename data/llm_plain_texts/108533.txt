tldr: The author presents two cases where ovules were discovered in the Fallopian tubes of unimpregnated women who died during menstruation. This challenges the belief that ovules are only extruded during impregnation or sexual intercourse. The findings support the idea that ovules mature and are extruded independently of male seminal fluid during menstruation.
