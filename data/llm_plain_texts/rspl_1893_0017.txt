semantic_tags:
  - Gas densities
  - Measurement techniques
  - Barometers
  - Manometers
  - Gas properties
tldr: 'The author, Lord Rayleigh, describes improvements in measuring the densities of gases, focusing on the accuracy of the apparatus and techniques used. He discusses the design and use of a manometer to measure pressure and the importance of precise temperature and pressure settings. The author's work contributes to a better understanding of gas properties and their applications.'
