semantic_tags:
  - Electrochemistry
  - Surface tension
  - Electrocapillary phenomena
  - Lippmann-Helmholtz theory
  - Nernst-Planck theory
tldr: The authors examine the nature of electrocapillary phenomena and their relation to potential differences between solutions. They discuss the Lippmann-Helmholtz theory and its agreement with the Nernst-Planck theory, exploring the surface tension and potential differences in various experiments with electrolytes.
