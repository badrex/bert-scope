tldr: 'In January 1835, a volcanic eruption occurred at Cosiguina in Central America. The eruption was preceded by a slight noise and a column of smoke that turned into a large cloud. The eruption caused several earthquakes, and the surrounding areas experienced darkness, ashfall, and a fetid smell. The impact was severe, with thousands of cattle killed and many small birds suffocated. Two islands were also formed within the Bay of Fonseca due to the volcanic activity.'
