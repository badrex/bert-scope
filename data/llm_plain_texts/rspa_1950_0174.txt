tldr: The authors studied the reducing power and growth rate of Bact. lactis aerogenes bacterial cultures using different carbon substrates. They found that the reducing power remains constant despite variations in growth rates. This suggests that there is a rate-limiting step in the cell mechanism that consumes molecular oxygen, which is not affected by adaptation to new carbon sources.
