tldr: This study investigates the effects of cold acclimatization on finger numbness and tactile sensitivity in humans. The research was conducted in both cold environments and controlled cold-room settings. Results showed that indoor men experienced a greater numbing effect on their fingers compared to outdoor men. Cold acclimatization was found to have a cumulative effect, with finger sensitivity improving over time. Further research is needed to understand the role of resting finger blood flow in maintaining finger warmth and tactile discrimination.
