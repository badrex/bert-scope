tldr: The author investigates the artificial formation of organic substances, such as fibrin and chondrin, from albumen using various methods like passing oxygen and hydrogen gas through albumen. The experiments demonstrate how different conditions, such as temperature, pH, and the presence of certain chemicals, can lead to the formation of different substances. These findings could provide insights into the understanding of biological processes and the role of albumen in the body.
