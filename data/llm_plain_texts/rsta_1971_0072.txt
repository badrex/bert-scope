tldr: This article discusses solar studies with a focus on space observations, particularly the production of solar and stellar chromospheres and coronae. The authors explore the interplay of downward conductive flux, dissipation losses, and radiative losses in chromospheric layers. They also examine the mechanical flux at the base of the chromosphere and its role in heating the outer solar layers. The article highlights the differences in mechanical energy flux in magnetic and non-magnetic solar regions and the impact on chromospheric and coronal structures.
