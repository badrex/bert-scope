tldr: The authors derive the general static spherically symmetric solution in Einstein's unified field theory, considering both electric and magnetic fields. They find that the solutions have an infinity of singular surfaces and do not contain an arbitrary constant corresponding to the mass of the system. The electric field arises from a dispersed charge distribution containing both positive and negative electricity, while the magnetic field can be considered as arising from a point magnetic pole. The solutions are unlikely to have physical significance, as more likely solutions exist in the purely electric case.
