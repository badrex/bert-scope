tldr: The authors isolated and characterized the genes coding for four major cellulases produced by the cellulolytic fungus Trichoderma reesei. They expressed these genes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, resulting in the secretion of cellulases by these strains. The recombinant cellulases showed activity towards cellulosic substrates, and the information obtained from the cloned genes could lead to the development of new cellulolytic organisms and improved enzymes.
