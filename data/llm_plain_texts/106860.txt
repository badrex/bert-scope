tldr: The author proposes a plan to measure an arch of the meridian and a parallel of longitude, using the Observatory of Geneva as their common intersection. The plan aims to improve the accuracy of measuring the earth's dimensions and figure, which is essential for astronomy and navigation. The author suggests using the town of St. Jean de Maurienne as the southernmost point of the arch and discusses potential stations and triangles for the measurements.
