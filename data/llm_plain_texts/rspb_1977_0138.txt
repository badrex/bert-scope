tldr: This study investigates the dissociation of sheep and human haemoglobin using laser light-scattering methods. The results show that both haemoglobins have similar dissociation behavior, suggesting a similarity in their amino acid composition. The findings confirm and extend previous osmotic pressure and sedimentation equilibrium studies, providing valuable insights into the structure and function of haemoglobin systems.
