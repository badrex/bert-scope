tldr: The authors present a new method for measuring magnetic hysteresis using an electro-dynamometer. They compare their results with those calculated from cyclic B-H curves obtained by a ballistic electrometer and find satisfactory agreement. The authors also study the influence of tension on the hysteresis effects and discuss the limitations of the method.
