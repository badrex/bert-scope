tldr: The authors examine the effects of concentration-dependent diffusivity on a reaction-diffusion process with applications in chemical kinetics. They consider piecewise-classical solutions to an initial-boundary value problem and establish the existence of a family of permanent form travelling wave solutions. The development of the solution to the initial-boundary value problem is also discussed, showing that an interface will always form in finite time with its initial propagation speed being unbounded.
