tldr: This article explores the behavior of cnoidal waves and bores in fluid dynamics. It presents a new approach to understanding stationary gravity waves, using cnoidal wave-trains instead of sinusoidal ones. The study also investigates the relationship between wave resistance, wave length, and wave amplitude, and how these factors affect the formation of bores in flowing streams.
