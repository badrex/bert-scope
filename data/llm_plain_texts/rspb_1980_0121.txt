tldr: This article discusses the regulation of neuropeptide release in the central nervous system. It explores the release mechanisms of various neuropeptides, such as substance P, Met- and Leu-enkephalin, somatostatin, neurotensin, and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, in response to stimulation. The study shows that these neuropeptides can be released from neurons in the central nervous system and that their release is regulated by local chemical mechanisms involving presynaptic receptors. The article also highlights the role of GABA in regulating substance P release from presynaptic nerve terminals.
