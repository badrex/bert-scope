tldr: This article explores the volume effect in high-polymer solutions and its impact on the osmotic pressure. The authors calculate the average dimensions of a chain with interactions using a statistical method and examine the pair distribution function governing the probability of the distance between chain elements. They apply the theory to real-world systems, such as polystyrene-butanone, polystyrene-toluene, and polyisobutylene-cyclohexane, to demonstrate its practical applications.
