tldr: The authors developed an improved machining theory that takes into account the strain rate and temperature dependence of the work material's flow stress properties. They used this theory to predict the strain rate in the zone of intense shear during machining and found excellent agreement with experimental results. The study also showed that using a constant flow stress material in the machining theory leads to extremely large strain rates, highlighting the importance of considering variable flow stress properties.
