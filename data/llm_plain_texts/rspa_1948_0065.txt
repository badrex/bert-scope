tldr: The authors developed a method to measure intensity distribution in soft X-ray regions without assuming the photographic reciprocity law. They obtained characteristic blackening curves for photographic plates and examined the K emission bands of graphite, lampblack, diamond, and carborundum. This study provides a better understanding of the energy distribution of valence electrons in solids and improves the accuracy of soft X-ray spectroscopy.
