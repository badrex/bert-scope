tldr: This article discusses the numerical solution of partial differential equations using the finite-element method based on variational principles. It explores various basis functions and their applications in solving elliptic boundary-value problems, as well as the Ritz-Galerkin method for approximating solutions. The article also covers the use of Hermit functions, spline functions, and bivariate splines in one and two dimensions.
