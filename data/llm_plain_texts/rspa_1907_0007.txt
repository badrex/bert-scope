tldr: This article investigates the photoelectric fatigue of zinc, exploring how the metal's surface activity diminishes when exposed to light. The author finds that the decay of zinc's photoelectric activity can be expressed by a single exponential term after an initial rapid change. The study provides insight into the behavior of metals under the influence of light and the underlying mechanisms of photoelectricity.
