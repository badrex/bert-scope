tldr: The author conducted an electron microscopic study of Amoeba proteus to understand its fine structure and organelles. They described methods of fixation, embedding, and sectioning for electron microscopy and discussed the major structures of the amoeba, such as the nucleus, mitochondria, food vacuoles, and contractile vacuole. The study provides insights into the ultrastructure of the cell and its implications for various cellular processes.
