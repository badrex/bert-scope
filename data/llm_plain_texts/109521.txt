tldr: The author demonstrates the validity and usefulness of operations involving imaginary quantities in mathematics. They show that these operations follow strict logical rules and can be used to clarify ambiguous expressions and facilitate calculations. The author also argues that imaginary expressions are particularly helpful in deducing certain conclusions that would be difficult to obtain without them.
