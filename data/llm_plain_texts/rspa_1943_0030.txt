tldr: The authors conducted an experiment using coincidence counters to study penetrating showers and discovered a new type of radiation called N-radiation. They found that N-radiation is more penetrating than photons and suggested that it might consist of neutrons. This discovery expanded the understanding of cosmic radiation.
