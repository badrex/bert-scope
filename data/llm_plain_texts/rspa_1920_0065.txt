tldr: This article investigates the transmission of electric waves around the Earth, focusing on the decrease of the magnetic force's amplitude as the distance between the transmitter and receiver increases. The author presents a mathematical and physical analysis, discussing the effects of imperfect conduction and the importance of different residues in the transmission process.
