tldr: This article discusses the relevance of charge transfer for the 300 nm transition in unsaturated ketones. The author examines the electronic and structural properties of these compounds and their optical properties, concluding that charge transfer is of small importance for the 300 nm transition. The study also compares the orbital approach of Labhart and Wagniere with the interacting chromophore approach of Longuet-Higgins and Murrell, finding the latter more satisfying and less reliant on charge transfer.
