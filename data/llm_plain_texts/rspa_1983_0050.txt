tldr: This article investigates the impact of meteorological phenomena on the Earth's rotation, focusing on fluctuations in the total angular momentum of the atmosphere. The authors demonstrate that changes in length-of-day and polar motion can be attributed to atmospheric contributions, providing a theoretical basis for future research in meteorology and geophysics.
