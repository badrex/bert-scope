tldr: This study investigates the ultrastructure and characterization of anisotropic magnetic inclusions, or magnetosomes, found in magnetotactic bacteria. The magnetosomes are bullet-shaped and have a hexagonal shape in cross-section. They are made of the mineral magnetite and are organized in chains within the bacterial cells. This research has implications for understanding biomineralization processes, as well as for the study of palaeobiology, palaeomagnetism, and magnetostratigraphy.
