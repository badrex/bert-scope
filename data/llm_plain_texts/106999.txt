tldr: 'Caroline Herschel, assisted by her brother William, discovered a new comet using a 5-feet reflector telescope. They observed its position, movement, and characteristics, noting that it had no nucleus and appeared as an ill-defined haziness. The comet was visible to the naked eye and moved in a retrograde motion, passing between the head of the Swan and the constellation of the Lyre. This discovery highlights the contributions of early female astronomers and the importance of observational astronomy in understanding celestial objects.'
