tldr: The authors analyze the power spectral density of radiocarbon variations and find spectral lines at various periods, including 2300, 964, and 208 years. They suggest that some of these lines may have a solar source, connecting the Sun and climate through hydromagnetic and bolometric variations. The study also explores the connection between radiocarbon periodicities and atmosphere-ocean resonances, providing insights into Earth's climate history and the relationship between solar activity and climate change.
