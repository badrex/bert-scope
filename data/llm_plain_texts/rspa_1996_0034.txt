tldr: The authors apply the superspace formalism to describe the symmetries of incommensurate urea inclusion compounds. They analyze urea inclusion compounds containing n-alkane, diacyl peroxide, and di-bromoalkane guest molecules, focusing on the relationship between superspace symmetry, the various types of (dis)order in the guest subsystem, and the point-symmetry of the guest molecules.
