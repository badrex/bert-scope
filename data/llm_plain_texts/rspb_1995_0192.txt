tldr: 'Researchers compared the fracture strengths of the inner and outer surfaces of the eggshell in domestic fowl using a new testing method. They found that the inner surface is stronger than the outer surface, with an average fracture stress of 36.7 for the inner surface and 27.3 for the outer surface. This discovery could help improve our understanding of eggshell structure and strength.'
