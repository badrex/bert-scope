tldr: The authors studied the reaction of hydrogen and oxygen in a silver vessel and found that the reaction was a surface reaction, with no signs of chain propagation in the gas phase. The high chain-breaking efficiency of silver is attributed to the catalytic destruction of active species at the silver-silver oxide surface, which would normally propagate the chains.
