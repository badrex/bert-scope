tldr: The authors conducted experiments on octopuses to study their memory and learning capabilities. They discovered that octopuses can learn to avoid attacking a crab shown with a white square, and this memory can last for several days. The study found that the vertical lobe system plays a crucial role in memory retention, and the neural pathways involved in this process are complex and interconnected. The findings provide insights into the neural basis of learning and memory in cephalopods.
