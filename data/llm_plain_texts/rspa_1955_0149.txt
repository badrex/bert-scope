tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the micro-displacements between two bodies in contact under tangential forces. They investigated the effect of normal loads and oscillating forces on the contact surfaces, providing support for Mindlin's theoretical elastic analysis. The results showed that the degree of plastic strain occurring at the interface is governed by the stress distribution in the elastic hinterland.
