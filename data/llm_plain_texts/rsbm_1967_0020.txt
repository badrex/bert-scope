tldr: 'William Wilson was a British physicist and educator who made significant contributions to the fields of photo-electricity and quantum theory. He studied at the University of Leipzig, where he conducted early research on the photo-electric effect and developed the quantum conditions. Wilson later taught at King's College London and Bedford College, where he continued his research and made important connections between the theory of relativity and wave mechanics. His work and influence in physics education are still remembered today.'
