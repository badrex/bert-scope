tldr: The article investigates the utilization of labelled pyruvate, fumarate, and glucose in Kalanchoe leaves in the dark. The experiments show that these compounds are incorporated into acids of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and related amino acids. The results suggest that the infiltrated pyruvate is used in three ways: oxidation, carboxylation, and dark fixation of CO2. The study provides insights into the metabolic processes in acidifying leaves and the role of storage pools in the incorporation and release of acids for further metabolism.
