tldr: This article presents an experimental study on the heat developed during the plastic extension of metals. The authors measure the heat evolved during the stretching process and analyze the temperature rise in the metal samples. They find that the observed heat evolution is lower than the equivalent of the work done on the specimens, indicating that the internal energy does not have a direct relationship with the work done on the metal. The study provides insights into the mechanics of metal deformation and the development of heat during the process.
