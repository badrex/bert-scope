tldr: The authors analyze Chapman-Jouguet deflagrations, a type of high-speed combustion, and compare their theoretical findings with experimental data. They find that these deflagrations are similar to highly three-dimensional turbulent deflagrations in rough tubes and depend on the energetics of the reacting mixture rather than the flow structure. The study provides a theoretical analysis of a configuration consisting of a plane precursor shock wave driven by a plane CJ deflagration, which agrees well with observations.
