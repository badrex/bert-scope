tldr: This obituary honors the lives and contributions of Harold Bailey Dixon and Hugh Longbourne Callendar, both of whom made significant advancements in the field of combustion research and chemical dynamics. Dixon's groundbreaking discovery that prolonged drying of a mixture of carbonic oxide and oxygen with phosphoric anhydride renders it non-explosive when exposed to electric sparks opened up a new field of chemical investigation. Callendar's work on the measurement of temperature in high-speed gases and his development of the Callendar effect made significant contributions to thermometry and the understanding of heat transfer.
