tldr: The authors explore the role of marine cementation in the preservation of Lower Palaeozoic fossil assemblages. They argue that early marine cementation acted to retard taphonomic processes, leading to better preservation of fossil communities in carbonate shelf environments during the early Palaeozoic era. The cementation process had three main effects on fossil accumulation: forming hardground communities, producing mixed assemblages through incremental cementation, and preserving fossils in life position by immobilizing skeletons with cement fringes.
