tldr: Victor Moritz Goldschmidt was a prominent scientist who made significant contributions to the fields of mineralogy, geology, and geochemistry. His research on rock metamorphism, crystal chemistry, and the phase rule helped lay the foundation for modern inorganic crystal chemistry and geochemistry. Goldschmidt also studied contact and regional metamorphism, as well as the importance of metasomatism in ore deposits. His work has had a lasting impact on the scientific community and inspired many future researchers.
