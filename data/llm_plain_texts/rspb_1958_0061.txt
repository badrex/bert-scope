tldr: The absorption of 131I-labelled serum and colostral proteins by the gut of newborn calves was studied using tracer and electrophoretic techniques. The results showed that the newborn calf readily absorbs proteins from the serum and colostrum, with no evidence of selective absorption like that seen in young rats. The study also found that the serum albumin and /?-globulin left the circulation at a faster rate than the y-glo-bulins.
