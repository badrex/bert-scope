tldr: This case study tells the story of Nicolas Reeks, a boy born with feet turned inward, who was able to walk normally after sitting cross-legged for some time. Despite being deemed incurable by a surgeon, Nicolas' condition improved without any medical intervention. The healing was attributed to sitting cross-legged, and the case was documented by multiple witnesses.
