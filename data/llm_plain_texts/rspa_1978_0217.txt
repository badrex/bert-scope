tldr: The authors conducted a nuclear magnetic resonance investigation of solid tetraphosphorus trisulphide, exploring its unique molecular structure and properties. They found that the dipolar interaction plays a minor role in the nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum and spin-lattice relaxation. The study provides insights into the molecular motions and interactions in the solid-state, revealing the first solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum of the compound.
