tldr: The author, John Hunter, conducted experiments on animals and vegetables to study the effects of heat and cold. He developed a more accurate thermometer and discovered that animals and inanimate matter can have similar variations in heat and cold. The author also found that the human body can adapt to varying temperatures and that certain body parts, like extremities, are more susceptible to temperature changes.
