tldr: This study investigates the effects of selection and assortative mating on the ancestral and fraternal correlations in a Mendelian population. The results show that selection and assortative mating affect correlations in opposite directions, with selection having a more dominant effect in practical cases. The study also finds that the sibling correlation is not raised as much by assortative mating nor reduced as much by selection as the parental correlation.
