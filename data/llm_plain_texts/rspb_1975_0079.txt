tldr: The study investigates the re-innervation of axolotl limbs after cutting or crushing sensory nerves and their regeneration. The results show that while motor nerves can restore coordinated movement, sensory nerves do not show a special tendency to innervate their original skin areas. This implies that any modifiability of sensory innervation resides in the central terminations within the nervous system.
