tldr: The author, Peter Woulfe, conducted experiments to understand the composition of selenite and gypsum. He discovered that these minerals contain a mixture of acid of vitriol, calcareous earth, and clayey matter. Woulfe also found that tobacco-pipe clay is a rich source of alum and can be used to make alum with little art and expense.
