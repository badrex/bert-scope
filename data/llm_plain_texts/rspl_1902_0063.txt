tldr: This article discusses the effects of prolonged exposure to liquid air temperature on micro-organisms. The authors found that even after six months of exposure to temperatures around -190°C, the vitality of micro-organisms like B. typhosus, B. coli communis, Staphylococcus pyogenes aureus, and Saccharomyces remained unaffected. The study also shows that mechanical trituration at liquid air temperature abolishes the luminosity of photogenic bacteria, suggesting that luminosity is a function of the living cell and dependent on the intact organization of the cell.
