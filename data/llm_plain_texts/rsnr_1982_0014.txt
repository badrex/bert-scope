tldr: This article examines the correspondence between Faraday and Thomson regarding their discussions on diamagnetism. It highlights how Thomson's mathematical expertise combined with Faraday's experimental findings led to the development of the first rigorous field theory of magnetism. The author argues that Faraday's resistance to some of Thomson's ideas stemmed from his experimentalist's distrust of abstract mathematics. The article also discusses Faraday's changing attitude towards the role of mathematics in natural philosophy.
