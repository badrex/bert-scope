tldr: 'This article presents the first observations of the principal susceptibilities of cobalt ammonium sulphate and nickel sulphate heptahydrate as functions of temperature down to about 14K. The measurements confirm the law of Weiss and show that each of the principal susceptibilities deviate from the Curie law at temperatures obtainable with liquid hydrogen. The authors also suggest that the measurement of the principal susceptibilities as functions of temperature may serve to determine the structure of paramagnetic crystals, at least as concerns the positions of the paramagnetic atoms.'
