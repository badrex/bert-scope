tldr: This study examines the fine structure of layers I and II of the somatic sensory cortex in cats using electron microscopy. The researchers describe the distinct characteristics of neurons, dendrites, and axonal ramifications in each layer, providing a foundation for further experimental investigations on the cortical organization and extrinsic afferent pathways.
