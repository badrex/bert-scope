tldr: The author investigates the diffraction phenomena that occur when light is refracted at nearly the critical angle on the boundary between two media. They discovered an asymmetrical distribution of intensity in the diffraction pattern, which is not explained by the ordinary law of refraction. This finding has implications for understanding the behavior of light in optical devices like the Lummer-Gehrcke plate.
