tldr: The author, David Brewster, investigates the structure and action of the crystalline lens in various animals, including fish and quadrupeds, using polarized light. He discovers that the lens has a unique structure with different parts acting like two classes of doubly refracting crystals. This structure is essential for correcting spherical aberration in the eye.
