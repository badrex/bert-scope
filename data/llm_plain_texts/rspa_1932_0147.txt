tldr: This article presents a quantum theory of -particle collisions with atomic nuclei, considering the disturbance of the incident wave by the Coulomb repulsive field of the nucleus. The probability of -particle exchange is analyzed, showing it to be significant at resonance levels. The theory is also applied to the anomalous scattering of -particles by light nuclei and discusses its range of applicability to such cases. This theory could be used to accurately determine the radii of light nuclei.
