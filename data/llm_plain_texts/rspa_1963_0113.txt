tldr: This article presents an experimental study of charge transfer and ionization in positive ion interactions in the energy range of 60 to 450 keV. The authors used a unique method to measure the total slow ion current, enabling them to determine the effective charge transfer cross-sections. The results show good agreement with other high-energy data, demonstrating the effectiveness of their method and providing valuable insights into the behavior of positive ions in various interactions.
