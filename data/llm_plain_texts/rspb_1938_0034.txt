tldr: The authors investigated the starch-iodine coloration as an index of differential degradation by various amylases. They found that the changes in iodine coloration can be quantitatively measured and used to indicate the progress and type of starch breakdown by different amylases. This study helps in understanding the enzymatic degradation of starch and the properties of amylases from different sources.
