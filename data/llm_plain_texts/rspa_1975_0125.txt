tldr: This article discusses the use of three-bond spin-spin coupling constants in determining the structures and conformations of molecules in solution. The authors explore the relationship between these coupling constants and dihedral angles, and demonstrate their application in analyzing flexible molecules like choline derivatives and peptides. The study highlights the importance of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in understanding molecular conformations and their implications in biological recognition processes.
