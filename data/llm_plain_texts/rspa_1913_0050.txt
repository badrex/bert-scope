tldr: The article is an obituary for Samuel Hawksley Burbury, a prominent mathematician and physicist who made significant contributions to the kinetic theory of gases and statistical mechanics. Burbury collaborated with H.W. Watson on various works, including a treatise on the mathematical theory of electricity and magnetism. He was involved in a controversy regarding the uniqueness of the Boltzmann-Maxwell distribution and proposed an alternative assumption, known as "assumption B." Burbury's work laid the foundation for further research in statistical molecular theory and gas diffusion.
