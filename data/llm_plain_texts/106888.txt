tldr: During the solar eclipse, the author, William Herschel, observed the moon's mountains and their heights using telescopes. He found that even small mountains, less than a mile high, can be perceived and measured accurately with the right telescope and power. This observation helped in estimating the moon's mountains and understanding its surface better.
