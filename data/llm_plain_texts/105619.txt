tldr: 'James Porter, the British Ambassador in Constantinople, observed the Transit of Venus in 1761. He used a Hadley's reflector telescope and a pendulum clock to measure the event. His observations showed that Venus entered the Sun's disk earlier than expected and emerged totally after a certain time. This observation helped in understanding the celestial event and the position of the stars.'
