tldr: The author presents a study on the specific inductive capacities of various dielectrics and their refractive indices. The research uses a zero method, where electrified metal plates never touch the dielectrics, and the electrification is produced by an induction coil. The author provides a table of results, comparing the refractive indices of transparent dielectrics with the square roots of their specific inductive capacities.
