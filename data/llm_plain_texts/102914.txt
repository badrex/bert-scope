tldr: The author, William Derham, observed and documented the appearance and movement of sunspots over time. He also invented a new type of micrometer to measure the sun's spots more accurately, which could be useful for determining the sun's altitude and diameter. Although he could not observe a complete revolution of the sunspots, his work laid the foundation for future studies of solar activity and telescope technology.
