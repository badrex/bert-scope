tldr: 'This article compares the attitudes of William Bateson and Erwin Baur towards eugenics, a topic they both believed should be applied to human genetics. While both scientists agreed on the importance of genetics, they differed in their views on the role of the state in intervening in eugenics. Baur was concerned about the dilution of the German race by foreign elements and the need for eugenic reform, while Bateson focused on the impact of eugenics on society and the environment. The article highlights the historical context and the influence of their views on the scientific community of the time.'
