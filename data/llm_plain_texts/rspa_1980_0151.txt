tldr: This article presents a numerical method for solving the three-dimensional pipe flow boundary layer equations, focusing on the effects of surface irregularities on the flow. The study calculates some three-dimensional separated flows and discusses the challenges of the external triple-deck problem. The findings contribute to the understanding of boundary layer interactions and fluid dynamics in complex flow situations.
