tldr: The authors used deuterium NMR spectroscopy, gas chromatography, and mass spectrometry to study the products of 2-methylpropene reactions with deuterium over supported metal catalysts. They found that the distribution of deuterium atoms in the products provided evidence for associative and dissociative mechanisms in the reactions, with different metals showing varying contributions from vinyl or allyl species.
