tldr: This article describes the process of meiosis in female silkworms (Bombyx mori) and the role of the synaptonemal complex in chromosome pairing and alignment during oogenesis. The synaptonemal complex is found to persist until metaphase I, suggesting that it may substitute for chiasmata in ensuring regular disjunction of homologous chromosomes in the absence of crossing over.
