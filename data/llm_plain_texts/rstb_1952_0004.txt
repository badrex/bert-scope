tldr: This study examines the nervous system of Saccoglossus cambrensis, an enteropneust, focusing on its arrangement of nerve fibers, histology, and functioning. The research reveals a complex network of nerve fibers throughout the organism, with various nerve cords and bundles conducting signals for movement, reactions to stimuli, and other functions. The study also discusses the role of the proboscis and the presence of "giant nerve cells" in the neurocord.
