tldr: 'The article discusses the role of Rho and Rac GTPases in controlling cell growth and responses. Rho regulates the assembly of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers, while Rac is involved in actin polymerization at the plasma membrane and activation of a membrane-bound NADPH oxidase in phagocytes. These proteins play a crucial role in various cellular processes, including phagocytosis and cell signaling.'
