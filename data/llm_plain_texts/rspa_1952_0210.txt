tldr: The authors studied the thermal decomposition of potassium azide and found that it consists of an initial decay process followed by a linear process corresponding to an interface reaction. The presence of potassium vapor accelerates the decomposition, and the coloration complex in the azide is consistent with previous theories. The decomposition process is explained by the formation and decay of color centers, which involve trapped excitons and positive holes.
