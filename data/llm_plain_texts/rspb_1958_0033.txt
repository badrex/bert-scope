tldr: The author's experiments with hypertonic solutions reveal that heat production in a muscle twitch begins before the mechanical response of contraction. By soaking muscles in hypertonic solutions, the mechanical response is delayed or abolished, while a substantial part of the heat production remains. This supports the conclusion that chemical reactions triggered by a stimulus precede the mechanical response in muscle contractions.
