tldr: This article discusses the identification, provenance, and amalgamation history of terranes in the Caledonides. The authors use various criteria, such as sedimentary records and tectonic elements, to identify and analyze the terranes. They also explore the relationship between terrane accretion and the generation of sediment during the uplift and translation of terranes. The study provides insights into the complex history of the Caledonides and the processes involved in terrane formation and amalgamation.
