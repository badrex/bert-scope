tldr: 'Lise Meitner, a pioneering physicist, was a key figure in the discovery of nuclear fission and the study of radioactivity. Born in Vienna, she worked in Berlin with Otto Hahn, where they made significant contributions to the field of nuclear physics. Meitner faced challenges as a woman in a male-dominated field but continued to make important discoveries throughout her career. She later became the head of the physics department at the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry.'
