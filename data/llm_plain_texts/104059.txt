tldr: The author, Sir Conrad Sprengell, discusses the Plica Polonica, a condition commonly believed to be a disease affecting people in Poland. He argues that it is not a real disease but rather a result of poor hygiene and cultural practices. The author also mentions the connection between the Plica Polonica and the myth of Medusa, suggesting that the twisted locks of hair might have inspired ancient stories of snakes growing on the head.
