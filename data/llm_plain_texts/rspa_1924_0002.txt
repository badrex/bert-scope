tldr: The author analyzes the crystal structure of aragonite, a mineral with the same composition as calcite, and finds that it has a simple orthorhombic lattice. The study uses X-ray diffraction to determine the positions of calcium atoms and CO3 groups within the crystal structure, revealing similarities and differences between aragonite and calcite. This research contributes to the understanding of the structures of minerals and their properties.
