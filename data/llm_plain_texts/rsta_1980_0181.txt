tldr: This article discusses the origin and early evolution of galaxies, focusing on the search for optical evidence of galaxy evolution. The author explores the use of deep photographic plates for statistical studies of faint galaxies and the implications of their evolution on astrophysics and cosmology. The study of galaxy clustering and the correlation of positions can provide insights into physical models of clustering over large look-back times.
