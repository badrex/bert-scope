tldr: The authors study the process of small eddies formation from large ones in fluid dynamics, particularly in turbulent flow. They explore the connection between the statistical representation of turbulence and the dissipation of energy, and propose a mechanism for the grinding down of large eddies into smaller ones, which is essential in understanding turbulent motion and diffusion.
