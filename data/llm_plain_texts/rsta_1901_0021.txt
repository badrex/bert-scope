tldr: The authors conducted a detailed examination of the spectra photographed during the solar eclipse of January 22, 1898, and determined the wave-lengths of various lines in the solar spectrum. They found that the cusp spectra had a "washed-out" appearance compared to the Fraunhofer spectrum, and discussed the bright lines of the chromosphere and the flash spectrum. The authors also determined the depth of the chromosphere and the extent of various spectral lines.
