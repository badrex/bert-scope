tldr: This article discusses the development of methods to calculate the wavemaking resistance of ships in calm water using potential flow theory. The authors focus on the Neumann-Kelvin approach, which neglects the nonlinear effects of the free surface and uses a Kelvin wave source distribution technique. They compare experimental and theoretical predictions for various ship forms and find that accurate numerical methods are crucial for solving the Neumann-Kelvin problem. The article also presents advancements in computational tools and efficient algorithms for evaluating the Kelvin wave source potential.
