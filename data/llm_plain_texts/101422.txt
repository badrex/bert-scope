tldr: The article describes the process of extracting brimstone and vitriol from the mineral of Liege. The mineral is similar to lead ore and is mined underground. To produce brimstone, the ore is heated in clay crucibles, and the resulting liquid sulfur is collected and cooled with water. To produce vitriol, the ash from the brimstone production is mixed with water and boiled in lead kettles. The resulting liquid is then left to separate into copperas (vitriol) and water, which can be used for further production.
