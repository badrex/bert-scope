tldr: The article investigates the neuromuscular mechanisms of the extensor tibialis muscle in locusts, focusing on the three motor nerve fibers that supply the muscle. Using intracellular microelectrodes, the researchers study the electrical events and muscle contractions associated with each nerve fiber. The findings reveal the complex control of muscle tension in locusts, which is essential for various activities such as jumping, walking, and maintaining tonic contractions.
