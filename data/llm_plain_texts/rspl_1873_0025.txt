tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the division of sound-waves by layers of flame or heated gas. They demonstrated that a sound-wave cannot pass through non-homogeneous air due to its successive partial reflections at the limiting surfaces of layers of air or vapor of different densities. The author used a vibrating bell and a sensitive flame to visualize the action of the reflected sound-wave and showed that it is analogous to the division of light by a plate of glass.
