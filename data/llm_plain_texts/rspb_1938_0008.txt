tldr: The authors studied the effects of pro-gonadotropic sera on various gonadotropic extracts. They discovered that the serum of a sheep and a goat, both injected with pituitary extracts, had an augmenting effect on the activity of the pig pituitary extract. This finding suggests that normal sera can increase the effectiveness of pituitary extracts, and the authors discuss possible explanations for this phenomenon.
