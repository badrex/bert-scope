tldr: This study investigates the fine structure of return lightning strokes and their relationship to channel branches. The researchers analyzed camera photographs of 120 lightning flashes and found that the luminosity-time curve at any point along the channel has a complex fine structure, indicating the development of additional energy in the channel. The evidence suggests that most of these components are triggered by the branches on the channel, and the return stroke travels with a velocity of around 2 x 10^9 cm/sec, decreasing as the stroke moves upwards.
