tldr: This article explores the role of residuals and alloying elements in temper embrittlement, focusing on the chemical composition and segregation processes that occur in steel during tempering. The author discusses the effects of various elements, such as antimony, tin, nickel, chromium, and manganese, on the embrittlement process and their interactions with each other. The article also highlights the importance of understanding these processes to improve the properties of steel materials.
