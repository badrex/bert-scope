tldr: This study examines the interaction of hydrogen with micro-crystalline charcoal, focusing on the adsorption processes and the stability of the charcoal. The researchers found that the crystalline structure of the charcoal affects its adsorptive capacity, and that the surface properties of the charcoal remain stable during various treatments. The findings provide insights into the behavior of hydrogen and charcoal at low temperatures and pressures, which can be useful for understanding and improving various applications, such as gas separation and storage.
