tldr: The author, Daines Barrington, presents a mole from North America to the Royal Society. He compares the American mole to the European mole, highlighting the differences in their teeth structure. The American mole has two large cutting teeth in the center of the upper jaw, while the European mole has six cutting teeth in the upper jaw. This distinction shows the specific differences between the two species.
