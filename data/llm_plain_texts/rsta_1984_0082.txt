tldr: This article discusses the long-term changes in the Earth's rotation from 700 BC to AD 1980. The authors analyze various observations, including occultations of stars by the Moon and solar and lunar eclipses, to understand the variations in the Earth's rotation. They also explore the importance of accurate lunar ephemeris and tidal acceleration in measuring secular changes in time. The study provides a comprehensive understanding of the Earth's rotation and its historical variations.
