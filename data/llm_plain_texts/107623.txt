tldr: This article discusses an experiment conducted by Peter Barlow to determine the effects of iron on the rates of chronometers. Barlow found that the proximity of a mass of iron could change the rate of a chronometer, and that the direction of the balance in relation to the iron affected the rate. The findings suggest that the iron's action on the chronometer's balance is due to the balance acquiring a polar or directive quality, which causes an acceleration or retardation depending on its position.
