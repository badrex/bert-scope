tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the effect of an electric field on the viscosity of liquids. They found that non-polar liquids showed no effect, while polar liquids experienced a small increase in viscosity proportional to the square of the electric field. The results suggest that electrostriction cannot be responsible for the observed effect.
