tldr: The authors studied the physiological effects of various pure organic nitrites of the paraffin series on striated muscular tissue. They found that secondary and tertiary nitrites are more powerful than their primary counterparts due to their greater chemical instability and ease of decomposition. The research has important implications for the therapeutic use of nitrites in medicine.
