tldr: The authors used the Moslashller-Rosenfeld theory to approximate the binding energies of very light nuclei, such as the deuteron and hydrogen isotope (triton). They determined the meson mass and two other parameters by comparing their calculations with observed binding energies. The results showed fair agreement with cosmic-ray measurements and provided insights into the interactions within these nuclei.
