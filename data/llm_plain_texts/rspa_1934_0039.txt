tldr: This article compares experimentally measured wave-profiles and wave-resistances of a form with parabolic waterlines to calculated values. The study uses two models, one with vertical sides and a flat bottom, and the other with rounded sides. The results show that the calculated wave-resistance and wave-profiles generally agree with the experimental data, demonstrating the efficiency of parabolic forms for low speeds.
