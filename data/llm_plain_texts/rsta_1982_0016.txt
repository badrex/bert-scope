tldr: This article investigates the electrical resistivity of gold films and how it is influenced by surface scattering and grain-boundary effects. The authors produce epitaxial gold films and measure their resistances from 2 to 300 K. They find that previous studies, which often relied on Fuchs' theory, have failed to present convincing evidence for specular surface scattering. The authors demonstrate the necessity of combining morphological observations and measurements over a wide temperature range with a theoretical method that accounts for both grain-boundary and angular-dependent surface scattering.
