tldr: The authors prove two results related to the spontaneous breakdown of symmetry in axiomatic theory. First, they demonstrate that Goldstone's theorem can be proven in a Wightman theory with a conserved current that generates a broken symmetry. Second, they show that for such theories, there exist infinitely many Lorentz-invariant positive linear functionals leading to a theory with positive energy. This means that the vacuum functional is non-unique, and there are multiple physically admissible inequivalent representations in the theory.
