tldr: The authors investigated the gas-phase oxidation of hexene-1 at 263Â°C and found that the reaction rate is influenced by hydrocarbon pressure. They discovered that the maximum rate of pressure change is not a valid measure of reaction rate. The study provides insights into the reaction mechanisms and kinetics, confirming similarities in the behavior of lower and higher olefins during oxidation. The findings contribute to the understanding of olefin oxidation reactions and the role of peroxides in the process.
