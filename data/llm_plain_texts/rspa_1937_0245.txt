tldr: This study investigates the chemical properties and composition of five representative coals from the Collie Coalfield in Western Australia. The coals were extracted using solvents and oxidized by boiling alkaline permanganate to analyze their carbon content and identify the benzene carboxylic acids present. The results show a remarkable similarity in the fundamental chemical structure of the main coal substance, despite differences in the original flora from which they were derived.
