tldr: The author conducted experiments on the structure of nerves, particularly the optic nerve, to understand their internal structure and function. They discovered that the retina in the eye is transparent during life, and the optic nerve has a semi-transparent state. The author also discussed the limitations of previous theories on nerve structure and the importance of using appropriate microscopes for accurate observations.
