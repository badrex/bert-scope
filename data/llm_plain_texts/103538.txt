tldr: 'The article describes a new kind of hydrometer invented by Mr. Clarke and communicated by J. T. Desaguliers. The hydrometer is made of copper and is designed to measure the specific gravity of spirituous liquors, allowing users to determine if a spirituous liquor is proof, above proof, or under proof, and exactly how much above or under. This invention is useful for customs officers who examine imported or exported liquors. The hydrometer also has a brass wire and various weights to measure specific gravities in all proportions related to the mixture of spirituous liquors.'
