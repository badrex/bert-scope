tldr: This article discusses the nonlinear effects in boundary-layer transition, focusing on spikes and spots. The authors present a strongly nonlinear theory and compare it with experimental findings. They explore the evolution of spots, their internal properties, and interactions with global dynamics. The research aims to provide a better understanding of turbulent flow and turbulence modeling.
