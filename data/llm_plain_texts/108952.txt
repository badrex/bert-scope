tldr: The author, William Huggins, conducted prismatic examinations of the light from various nebulae, observing their spectra and determining the brightness of the emitted light. He found that some nebulae have continuous spectra, while others have spectra with one, two, or three bright lines. By comparing these spectra with known spectra of elements like nitrogen, hydrogen, and barium, Huggins concluded that some nebulae have a gaseous constitution. This research helped in understanding the nature of nebulae and their relation to other celestial bodies.
