  - Bone preservation
  - Polymerase chain reaction
tldr: The authors explore the analysis of DNA from ancient bones and its applications in archaeology and molecular evolution. They demonstrate the extraction and amplification of mitochondrial DNA sequences from bones several hundred years old, and discuss the factors affecting DNA preservation and recovery. The study has significant implications for understanding human history and evolution.
