tldr: This article investigates the molecular surface-energy of esters and its variation with chemical constitution. The authors determine the densities of the liquids and their vapours in the saturated state, and find that the molecular surface-energy is a linear function of temperature for non-associating compounds. The study adds eight more compounds to the list of six previously studied, confirming the law's validity within wide temperature limits.
