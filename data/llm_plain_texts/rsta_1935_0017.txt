tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the adsorption of indium and thallium atoms on tungsten oxide surfaces. They used a thin oxide layer formed on tungsten when heated in air, which allowed them to maintain a uniform temperature and accurately measure it. The results provide insights into the adsorption processes on oxide catalysts and contribute to understanding thermionic sources of positive ions in high vacuums.
