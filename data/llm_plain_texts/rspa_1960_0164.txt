tldr: The authors investigate the bond lengths in large conjugated molecules, specifically cyclic polyenes C<sub>18</sub>H<sub>18</sub>, C<sub>24</sub>H<sub>24</sub>, and C<sub>30</sub>H<sub>30</sub>. They find that the bonds alternate in length, which affects the electronic levels and absorption frequencies of these molecules. This bond alternation is supported by the Huckel theory and helps explain the discrepancies between the calculated and observed absorption frequencies.
