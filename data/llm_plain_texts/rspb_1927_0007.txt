tldr: This study investigates the effects of X-rays on the ovaries of mice when exposed to radiation at or before birth. The results show that X-rays cause the majority of oocytes to degenerate, and the ovaries to be devoid of follicles. However, some follicles grow and form corpora lutea atretica, which persist in the ovary. The study also demonstrates that although irradiation before birth destroys most oocytes, some can grow and form follicles, which may produce corpora lutea atretica in adulthood.
