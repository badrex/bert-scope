tldr: The authors investigate the innervation, ultrastructure, and immunohistochemistry of the ventral eclosion muscle of Glossina, a type of fly. They discovered that two neurons in the thoracic ganglion control the muscle's degeneration, with one neuron activating an immunocyte involved in the muscle's dismantling. The study provides insights into the neural control of muscle degeneration in insects during development.
