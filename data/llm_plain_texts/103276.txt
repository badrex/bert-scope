tldr: 'Fr. Hauksbee conducted an experiment using pitch as an opaque material and discovered that it could become transparent under vacuum and attrition conditions. This experiment confirmed a previous experiment using sealing wax and showed that some opaque materials can become transparent under specific circumstances, such as a change in external conditions. This discovery was surprising and opened up the possibility of finding other unusual properties of materials through further experimentation.'
