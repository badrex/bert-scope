tldr: This article explores the role of organic-inorganic reactions during the progressive burial of sediments in enhancing porosity and permeability in sandstones. The authors focus on the temperature interval between 80 and 200°C, which includes the boundary between diagenesis and catagenesis of organic constituents in source rocks and the zone of porosity enhancement in sandstones. They propose a conceptual model for the reaction pathways of a sand-shale package in an aqueous environment undergoing progressive diagenesis.
