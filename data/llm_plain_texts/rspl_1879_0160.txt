tldr: The author examines the organization of fossil plants in coal measures, specifically the Lepidodendron and Sigillaria species. They argue against the classification of these plants as a cryptogamic Lycopod and a gymnospermous Sigillaria, respectively, and provide evidence for their shared origin and characteristics. The study also discusses the unique features of Stigmarian rootlets and the development of vascular bundles in these plants.
