tldr: The authors investigated the carbamate reaction of carbon dioxide with glycyl-glycine using a new electrode method. They found that the carbamate reaction is kinetically biphasic, with a rapid primary stage and a slow secondary stage. The results show that the carbamate compound of glycyl-glycine is a stronger acid than carbonic acid, and the ionization constant of the terminal groups of amino acid chains of proteins is within the same range as glycyl-glycine. This study provides a simple model for studying carbamate reactions in the more complex case of haemoglobin.
