tldr: 'Reginald George Stapledon was a pioneering agriculturist and ecologist who made significant contributions to the fields of plant and animal nutrition, grassland management, and agricultural research. Born into a family of Devon landowners and farmers, Stapledon was influenced by his mother's love for nature and her self-taught education. After studying at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, he pursued a career in agriculture and became an assistant at the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester. There, he worked with Edward Kinch, who inspired him to focus on grassland research. Stapledon's work on analyzing the botanical composition of pastures and his ecological outlook led to groundbreaking discoveries in the field of agriculture.'
