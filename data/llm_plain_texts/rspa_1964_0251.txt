tldr: The authors used Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) to study the conformational equilibria in fluorinated alkenes. They found that there are two rotameric forms with significant population for each isomer and calculated the enthalpy differences between rotamers. The study also revealed that long-range F-F coupling constants are large when the interacting nuclei are in close proximity. This research provides valuable information on the classification of coupling constants in fluorinated alkenes and their characterization.
