tldr: The author demonstrates a correspondence between the particle and wave aspects of mesons and photons, providing a unified approach to understanding their properties. This allows for the inclusion of nuclear interactions in the Kemmer formulation and extends the particle formulation to particles with zero rest-mass, such as photons. The author also derives a general formula for the spur of a product of any number of matrices, which can be useful in future calculations.
