revised_title: Reconciliation of Meteoric and Nebular Theories of Cosmogony
semantic_tags:
  - Meteorites

  - Kinetic theory of gases
tldr: The author suggests that the meteoric theory can reconcile the apparent divergence between the nebular hypothesis and the meteoric theory of the origin of planetary systems. By considering the impacts of meteorites as the source of fluid pressure, the author examines the mechanics of a swarm of meteorites, with a specific numerical application to the solar system.
