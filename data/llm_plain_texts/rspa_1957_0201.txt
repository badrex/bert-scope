tldr: The authors study the etching patterns on diamond octahedral cleavages and demonstrate a remarkable degree of matching and coincidence between the patterns on opposite cleavage faces. They establish that etch pits are distributed in three ways and that there is a one-to-one correspondence between centers of isolated pits and linear patterns. The etching reveals the growth history of the diamond and provides insights into the behavior of cleavage lines and crystal imperfections.
