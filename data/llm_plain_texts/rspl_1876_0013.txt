tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the absorption spectra of iodine in solid, liquid, and various solutions. They discovered that the absorption of light by iodine depends on its state and the nature of the liquid it is dissolved in. The study found that the absorption spectra of solid and liquid iodine, as well as solutions in different liquids, are similar, with the least amount of absorption occurring for light with a wavelength of about 650. The author also observed that the absorption spectra of iodine in bisulphide of carbon is continuous and extends further towards the less refrangible end of the spectrum.
