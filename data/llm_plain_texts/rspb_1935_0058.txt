tldr: The author discusses the principle of humoral transmission of nervous impulses and its role in the nervous system. They explain the release of substances like acetylcholine and adrenaline-like substances during nerve stimulation and how these substances are involved in the transmission of signals between neurons. The author also touches upon the possibility of humoral transmission in the central nervous system and its implications for understanding the functioning of the nervous system.
