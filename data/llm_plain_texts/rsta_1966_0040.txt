tldr: This article discusses the problem of rain erosion in aircraft and missiles, which can cause damage to components and affect their performance. The authors review the factors affecting rain erosion, such as material type, surface finish, and rainfall intensity, and provide empirical data for various materials. They also explore methods to extend the rain erosion 'life' of materials, including protective coatings and design improvements. The article highlights the importance of understanding and addressing rain erosion in the design and operation of high-speed aircraft and missiles.
