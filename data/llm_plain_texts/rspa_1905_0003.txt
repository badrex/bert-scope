tldr: The author presents a method for finding the conductivity of heat, especially in bad conductors, using a heated wire in a cylinder and measuring the difference in temperature at known distances from the wire. The method involves detailed accounts of the apparatus used and the mathematical problem of heat diffusion in an infinite solid. The author also discusses the time required for the steady state to be reached and provides a list of materials tested using the method.
