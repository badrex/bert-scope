tldr: This article explores the biochemistry and genetics of the complement system, focusing on the C4 gene. The author discusses the challenges posed by the C4 molecule's complexity and variability, as well as its close linkage to other complement loci within the MHC system. The author presents different models of inheritance for the C4 gene and highlights the importance of DNA techniques in understanding its genetic control and potential role in disease susceptibilities.
