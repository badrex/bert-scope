tldr: This study investigates the relationship between the morphology and feeding behavior of hoverflies. The research found that hoverflies' proboscis shape and size are correlated with the proportion of time spent feeding on nectar and pollen. Additionally, increased body size is associated with more time spent feeding on nectar, and a decrease in the proportion of time spent in flight with increasing body size. The findings suggest that species with similar size and shape feed on similar types of flowers and take similar foods.
