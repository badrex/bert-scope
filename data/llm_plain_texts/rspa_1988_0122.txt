tldr: The article presents a theoretical analysis of the sound produced when a field of vorticity interacts with an airfoil in low-Mach-number flow. A general formula is derived for the acoustic pressure when the airfoil is rigid and the chord is acoustically compact. The study focuses on the influence of an axial velocity defect within the core of a rectilinear vortex, which determines an azimuthal component of vorticity. The findings can be applied to problems involving discrete or localized vortex elements, such as helicopter noise during landing maneuvers.
