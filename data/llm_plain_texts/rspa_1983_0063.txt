tldr: The authors present new solutions for non-stationary boundary layers created by planar, cylindrical, and spherical Chapman-Jouguet detonation waves. They find that the Prandtl number has a significant influence on the boundary-layer flow structure and that their analysis agrees well with experimental heat-transfer measurements. This lends confidence to the new results on boundary layers induced by cylindrical and spherical detonation waves.
