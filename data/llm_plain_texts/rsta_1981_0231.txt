  - Long-Wave Limit
tldr: The authors study the behavior of periodic water-waves and show that they converge to solitary waves in the long-wave limit. They use an integral equation formulation to prove this convergence and discuss the properties of these waves, including their maximum angle of inclination and mean velocity.
