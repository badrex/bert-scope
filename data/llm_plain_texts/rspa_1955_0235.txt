tldr: This study investigates the diffusion of electrolytes in a cation-exchange resin membrane using a constant-flow diffusion apparatus. The experiments support the main tenet of the theory that transport of ions in resin occurs in an internal aqueous phase. The authors suggest improvements to the theory, including considering counterion binding by the resin and the electrophoretic effect in diffusion. The results provide valuable data for understanding the behavior of electrolytes in cation-exchange resin membranes.
