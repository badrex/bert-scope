tldr: 'Peter Barlow and Captain J. P. Wilson studied the secondary deflections in a magnetized needle placed within an iron shell. They discovered that when one end of the needle was weakened, the needle would approach or move away from the shell. This phenomenon supported the theory that the magnetism of an iron shell is induced by the action of the Earth. The researchers also provided numerical estimates for the amount of secondary deflection caused by a given extent of deterioration in the needle.'
