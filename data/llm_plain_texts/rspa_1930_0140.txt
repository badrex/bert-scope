tldr: This article discusses the application of Osborne Reynolds' theory of heat transfer and its limitations. The author critiques the assumptions made in Reynolds' theory and highlights the need for a more accurate understanding of heat transfer in turbulent flow. The article also presents an alternative method for calculating heat transfer in cases where Reynolds' theory may not be directly applicable.
