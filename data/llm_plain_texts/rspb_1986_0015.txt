tldr: The author discusses the chemosynthetic base of deep-sea ecosystems around hydrothermal vents, which produces organic carbon independent of sunlight. They address criticisms of this process and explain how it supports the existence of eukaryotic organisms in the absence of light. The author also highlights the role of anaerobic bacteria in these ecosystems and the importance of considering different electron acceptors in microbial physiology.
