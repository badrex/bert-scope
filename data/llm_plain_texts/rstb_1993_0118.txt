tldr: The authors used an atmosphere-ocean model to simulate the climate of the Late Permian era, considering detailed land-ocean boundaries, topography, and inland lakes and seas. They found that mountains and plateaus intensified monsoon circulations, while extensive inland seas and lakes dampened seasonal temperature ranges. The simulated climate-biome distribution showed good agreement with botanical evidence from the Late Permian period.
