tldr: Researchers investigated the relationship between the anterior pituitary body and the gonads in ferrets. They discovered that administering preparations containing gonad-stimulating principles from the anterior pituitary body could induce ovulation in anoestrous ferrets. This study provided insights into the regulation of the ovary and the potential for controlling reproductive cycles in animals.
