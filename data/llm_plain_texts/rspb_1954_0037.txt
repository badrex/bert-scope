tldr: The article investigates the competitive growth of lactose-positive and lactose-negative strains of Bact. coli mutabile when mixed and subcultured in a glucose-ammonium sulfate medium. The results show that the strains compete for predominance, with one strain outgrowing the other, and the outcome is influenced by the degree of general adaptation of the strains to the medium. The study highlights the importance of understanding the factors affecting bacterial population dynamics and growth.
