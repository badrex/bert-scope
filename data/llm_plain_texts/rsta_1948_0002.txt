tldr: This article introduces the fundamental concepts of a mathematical theory for large elastic deformations in isotropic materials. It discusses stress-strain relationships, strain definitions, and the elastic energy stored in deformed bodies. The authors also explore the assumptions of incompressibility and the neo-Hookean elasticity model for a wide range of elastic materials.
