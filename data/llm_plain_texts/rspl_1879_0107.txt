tldr: The author discusses the challenges faced in dynamo-electric machines and proposes a new design to improve their steadiness and efficiency. By reducing the resistance on the rotating helix and increasing the resistance on the magnets, the new machine provides a steadier light with greater average economy of power. This design also simplifies the regulator for electric lamps, making it more reliable and efficient.
