tldr: This article explores the evidence for the strength and arrangement of magnetic fields in interstellar clouds. The author concludes that magnetic fields pervade the entire interstellar medium, including low and high-density gas clouds. Magnetic fields play a significant role in astrophysical phenomena, such as gravitational collapse of clouds and star formation. The study also indicates that the magnetic field direction is preserved during cloud collapse.
