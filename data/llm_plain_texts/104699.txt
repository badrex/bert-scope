tldr: Dr. Bevis and James Short observed a total solar eclipse of the Moon on December 2, 1750, in London. They used a reflecting telescope with 40x magnification and a refracting telescope with 12x magnification. Their observations showed that the eclipse began about 8 minutes earlier than predicted by Dr. Halley's tables. The accuracy of the calculations was attributed to leaving out three of the seven equations of the Moon published by Sir Isaac Newton.
