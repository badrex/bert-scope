tldr: This article reports the observation of both whole-beam and transverse optical bistability in thin uncoated cadmium sulphide (CdS) platelets at milliwatt power levels when a continuous wave laser is tuned near the band gap. The observed whole-beam bistability is thermally induced and can be relatively fast due to the high thermal conductivity of CdS at low temperatures. The transverse bistability measurements were made with larger samples immersed in superfluid helium, and very large transverse effects were observed in the far field.
