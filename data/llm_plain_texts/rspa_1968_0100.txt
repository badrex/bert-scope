tldr: The authors calculate the dispersion energy contribution to the intermolecular potential in a benzene crystal and find that it is close to the experimental latent heat of sublimation. They also estimate the lattice energy and suggest that the molecule-molecule approximation is valid for benzene. The study provides a comparison between theoretical and empirical estimates of the attractive energy in benzene.
