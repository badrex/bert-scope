tldr: The authors developed a method to create controlled uniform drop size aerosols from pure liquids, specifically tetralin, to study the effect of drop size on the combustion properties of liquid-in-air suspensions. They discovered that the mechanism of flame propagation changes within the drop-size range of 7 to, with smaller drops behaving like a vapor and larger drops burning individually in their own air envelope. This transformation affects the lower concentration limit of inflammability and the burning rate.
