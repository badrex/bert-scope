tldr: This article investigates the mechanism of surface flow and polishing in metals and glasses. The authors find that high local temperatures at the points of contact between surfaces play a significant role in the process. They demonstrate that metals with lower melting points lose more weight during polishing, suggesting that surface melting or softening is a major factor. The authors also show that the relative melting point of the polisher and the solid is crucial for surface flow, polish, and the formation of the Beilby layer.
