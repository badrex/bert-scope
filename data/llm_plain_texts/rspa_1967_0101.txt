tldr: This article investigates the radiation chemical reactions in nitrous oxide solutions containing hexachloro-anions of iridium and platinum. The study focuses on the radical and molecular yields, and how they are affected by changes in solute concentration, pH, and the presence of other chemical species. The findings provide insights into the mechanisms of radiation-induced reactions in these systems and the role of solutes in affecting the yields of radicals and molecules.
