tldr: This article explores the nature of the pole and its residue in the two-body Green function due to a discrete intermediate state. The authors derive the form of the pole term for interacting Hermitian scalar fields with unequal mass particles and discuss its implications for the structure of the Green function. The findings have implications for understanding the behavior of particles in quantum field theory and particle physics.
