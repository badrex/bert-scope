tldr: The author, David Brewster, examines the effects of pressure on substances like animal jellies and isinglass jelly. He discovers that pressure can cause these substances to depolarize light and exhibit complementary colors in the images they form. This phenomenon is similar to the optical properties of crystallized minerals.
