tldr: This article investigates the magnetic susceptibility and related properties of rare-earth crystals. The authors analyze the effects of crystalline fields on magnetic ions and discuss the implications of these findings for understanding the energy spectra of ions. They also explore the potential of specific heat data and absorption spectra measurements in providing further insights into the structure of energy diagrams. The results challenge some existing interpretations of energy spectra and highlight the importance of considering anisotropy and deviations from cubic symmetry in the study of rare-earth crystals' magnetic properties.
