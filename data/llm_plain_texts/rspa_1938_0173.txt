tldr: This article investigates the classical equation of state for gaseous helium, neon, and argon, focusing on the interatomic interactions and the Lennard-Jones potential. The authors analyze the second virial coefficient and propose a method to determine the parameters of the potential, providing average values for helium, neon, and argon based on experimental data.
