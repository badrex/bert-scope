tldr: The authors, W. J. Russell and Nevil Story Maskelyne, conducted experiments to form and study double salts of silver and other nitrates. They discovered that double salts can form when the ratio of silver nitrate to potassium nitrate is increased, and that the composition of the solution changes depending on the composition of the mixture used. They also studied the crystal structure and optical properties of these double salts, finding that they belong to the oblique system and have negative optical character.
