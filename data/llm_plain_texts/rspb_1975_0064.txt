tldr: This article discusses the sources, distribution, degradation, and ultimate fate of fossil fuel hydrocarbons in marine animals. It explores the importance of pollution as a source of these hydrocarbons and the potential for their biosynthesis in marine organisms. The article also examines the transfer of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons through the marine food web, considering recent evidence for their uptake and release by various marine animals and the question of whether they are excreted unchanged or as metabolites.
