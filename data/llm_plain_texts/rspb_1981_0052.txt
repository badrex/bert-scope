tldr: This study investigates the relationship between primordial germ cells (p.g.cs) and the substrate they migrate on in early Xenopus laevis embryos. The authors examine the shape and cytoarchitecture of both p.g.cs and coelomic epithelial cells (c.e.cs) and find that c.e.cs provide a firm, orientated support and possible guide for p.g.c movement. The results suggest that p.g.cs move by forming direct adhesion plaques with c.e.cs.
