tldr: The author presents a mechanical model of growth in regular sea urchins, using thin shell theory to predict their shapes and associated forces. The model specifies two shape parameters, apical curvature and the ratio of the mimicked vertical pressure gradient to internal coelomic pressure, which define a developmental morphospace for studying constraints and macroevolutionary dynamics in urchins.
