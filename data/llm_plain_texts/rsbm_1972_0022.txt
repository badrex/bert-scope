tldr: The article provides a detailed account of The Svedberg's life and his significant contributions to the field of colloidal chemistry. Svedberg is known for his work on the preparation of organosols, the study of colloidal solutions, and the use of ultramicroscopy to observe Brownian motion. He also conducted research on isomorphic coprecipitation of radioactive compounds and was the first to suggest the complexity of chemical elements concealed under their chemical identity.
