tldr: The article discusses the process of cell lineage and commitment in early amphibian development using the single cell labeling technique with the laser dye tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC). The authors demonstrate that animal and vegetal pole cells are pluripotent at the early blastula stage, while vegetal pole cells are committed to form endoderm by the early gastrula stage. The study also shows that primordial germ cells, which arise from the vegetal part of the early embryo, remain pluripotent at the swimming tadpole stage.
