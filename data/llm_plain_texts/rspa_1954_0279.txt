tldr: The authors present a method for evaluating transition amplitudes for bound electrons in heavy atoms in second-order perturbation theory. They focus on the coherent scattering of gamma-rays by K electrons and provide a detailed explanation of the method, including the derivation of differential equations and the final integrals involved in the calculations.
