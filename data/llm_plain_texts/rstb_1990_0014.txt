tldr: The article discusses the role of DNA methylation and genomic imprinting in regulating gene expression during development. It highlights the differences in the roles of maternal and paternal chromosomes and how they influence cell proliferation and differentiation. The study suggests that maternal chromosomes are more important when embryonic cells are totipotential or pluripotential, while paternal chromosomes are needed for the proliferation of progenitor cells of differentiated tissues.
