tldr: This article extends a deductive theory of turbulence to hydromagnetics, deriving a pair of differential equations for the scalars defining the correlation in velocities and magnetic field intensities at two different points and times. The author introduces correlations between the components of velocity and magnetic field, and assumes that these correlations depend only on the difference in time and the distance between the points. The resulting equations provide a basis for an elementary theory of hydromagnetic turbulence.
