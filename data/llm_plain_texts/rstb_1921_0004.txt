tldr: The author examines the composition and structure of Irish eskers, which are hills of sand and gravel typically in the form of ridges. They analyze the Ballyduff and Newtownlow esker systems and conclude that the formation of these landforms is inconsistent with the glacial river theory. Instead, the author suggests that the material was accumulated from the adjacent front of a melting ice sheet and deposited by sheets of water.
