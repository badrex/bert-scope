  - Strain Effect
tldr: The author investigates the effects of light and electric radiation on matter, proposing a theory that these effects are due to molecular strain. They describe various methods to measure the impact of radiation on substances, such as changes in adhesive or cohesive power, chemical activity, electric potential, and conductivity. The author also discusses the influence of factors like previous history, temperature, and pressure on the response of substances to radiation.
