tldr: This study investigates the nucleation and growth of rare-gas crystals (argon, krypton, and xenon) using in-situ electron microscopy. The saturation density of nuclei is measured as a function of temperature and gas arrival rate. The results show that nucleation theory holds within a factor of 3 for krypton and all temperatures and arrival rates studied. The growth of three-dimensional crystals is found to occur after a strongly bound monolayer of adsorbed gas atoms covers the substrate.
