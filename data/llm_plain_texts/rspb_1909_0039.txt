tldr: The author examines the possible ancestors of domesticated horses and their evolutionary history. They discuss various species, such as Equus sivalensis, Equus stenonis, and Equus gracilis, and their differences in teeth, face structure, and limb bones. The author suggests that these ancestral species played a role in the development of modern horse breeds, and further research may reveal more connections between these ancient species and current breeds.
