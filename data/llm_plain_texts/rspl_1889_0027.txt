tldr: The author discovered that skatole, a compound previously found only in animal feces and bacterial decomposition of albumen, also exists in the wood of the Celtis reticulosa tree. Skatole, which has a strong faecal smell, was found to be a Pr-3 methyl indole, a type of indole derivative. This discovery expands the known sources of skatole and may have implications for understanding its formation in plants and animals.
