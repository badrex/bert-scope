revised_title: 'Bacteria as Proper Subjects for Cancer Research: Discovering New DNA Repair Pathways'
semantic_tags:
  - Cancer Research
  - Bacteria as Model Organisms
  - DNA Repair Mechanisms
  - Mutagenesis
  - Epigenetics
tldr: The author discusses the role of bacteria in cancer research and explores the organization of cell renewal in epithelia. By attaching multiplying bacteria to filters, the author discovered new DNA repair pathways that also appear to operate in mammalian cells. This research has implications for understanding cancer development and potential treatments.
