tldr: The authors study the response of an oscillatory system to excitation by a transient displacement. They show that the response is the same as that due to excitation by a transient force, simplifying the solution of vibration problems involving time-dependent boundary conditions. The concepts of effective modal stiffness and effective modal mass are also elucidated.
