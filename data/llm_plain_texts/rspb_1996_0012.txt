tldr: The study reveals that the zodariid spider Habronestes bradleyi exploits the chemical alarm signals of the meat ant Iridomyrmex purpureus to locate and prey on them. The spider is attracted to the airborne alarm pheromone 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one produced by injured or alarmed I. purpureus workers, demonstrating a novel cost of producing alarm pheromones.
