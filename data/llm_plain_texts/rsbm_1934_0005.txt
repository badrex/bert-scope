tldr: Pierre Paul Émile Roux was a prominent French microbiologist and bacteriologist who worked closely with Louis Pasteur. He made significant contributions to the fields of clinical bacteriology, vaccine development, and microbiology. Roux's work on puerperal septicaemia, fowl-cholera, anthrax, swine-erysipelas, and rabies helped advance our understanding of infectious diseases and led to the development of vaccines. His research on attenuated living microbes and the use of vaccines in preventive medicine laid the foundation for modern medical practices.
