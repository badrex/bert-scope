tldr: 'This article investigates the effects of temperature changes on the modulus of torsional rigidity of metal wires. The author conducted experiments on various pure metals, measuring the torsional oscillations and comparing the results with previous studies. The research aimed to confirm the relationship between metals' temperature coefficients of torsional modulus, coefficients of expansion, and melting points.'
