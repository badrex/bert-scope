tldr: The author describes pendulum experiments conducted in the Harton Colliery to determine the mean density of the Earth. The experiments aimed to compare the attraction of gravity at the top and bottom of a deep mine, using pendulums and clocks. The author discusses the challenges faced during the experiments and the improvements made over time, ultimately leading to a more accurate determination of the Earth's mean density.
