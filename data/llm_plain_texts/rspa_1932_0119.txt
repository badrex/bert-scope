tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the ionisation in the upper atmosphere and the critical penetration frequency. They discovered two ionised regions in the upper atmosphere, the Kennelly-Heaviside layer and a higher, richer ionised region. By measuring the equivalent height of reflection for various wavelengths, they determined the critical penetration frequency and its effects on wireless wave propagation.
