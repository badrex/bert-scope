tldr: This article investigates the nature and artificial production of voiced and unvoiced consonants. The author discovers that the distinction between these sounds is based on resonance in the mouth, with or without a difference in air pressure. The study also shows that the essential difference between voiced and unvoiced consonants is produced in the pharyngeal or laryngeal regions.
