tldr: This study investigates the effects of odd zonal harmonics and atmospheric oblateness on the lifetime of satellites in orbit. The research shows that these factors can change the lifetime of a satellite by up to 35%, and when combined, they can produce changes of up to 60%. These effects need to be considered for accurate estimates of satellite decay dates in the last few months of their lives.
