tldr: This article explores the existence of standing waves in exothermic systems near critical conditions of thermal ignition. The authors analyze the original Frank-Kamenetskii problem and discover a new stationary state in the form of a standing wave of reaction. Although unstable, this solution plays a crucial role in determining the critical local disturbance of the temperature field necessary for thermal ignition.
