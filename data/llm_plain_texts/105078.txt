tldr: Dr. Bianchini and his team conducted a series of experiments to investigate the effects of medical electricity on the human body. They tested various substances, such as sulfur, camphor, and opium, and found that the effects of these substances were not noticeable when applied through electricity. The experiments aimed to determine the truth behind previously published claims about medical electricity and its effects on the human body.
