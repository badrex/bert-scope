tldr: This article discusses the challenges and potential of using microbial inocula to control soil-borne plant pathogens. Despite over 60 years of research, only two control agents are widely used in commercial practice. The author suggests that future biocontrol strategies should target small pathogen populations and combine microbial inocula with management practices to minimize disease losses. Recent studies on the biocontrol of take-all disease by the fungus Microdochium bolleyi are presented, highlighting promising strategies for its control.
