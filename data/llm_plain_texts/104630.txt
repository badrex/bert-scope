tldr: In this letter, Henry Miles shares his observations of a very cold day in June and a very hot day in July 1749. He also discusses the agreement of thermometers in London and Tooting. Miles and his friend John Canton made similar observations and compared their findings, concluding that the temperature difference between the two places is imperceptible to the senses.
