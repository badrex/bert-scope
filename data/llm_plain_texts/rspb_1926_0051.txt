tldr: The authors investigated the antiseptic properties of various amino derivatives of styryl and anil quinoline compounds. They found that some compounds had strong antiseptic action on Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus coli, while others were less effective. The study also showed that certain chemical modifications, such as the presence of tertiary amino groups or acylation of the amino group, could increase the antiseptic potency of these compounds. The findings contribute to the understanding of the development of new antiseptics and antibiotics.
