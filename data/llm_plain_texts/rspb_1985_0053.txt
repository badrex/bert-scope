tldr: 'The authors discovered that oil shale extracts contain metalloporphyrins that promote barnacle settlement. They isolated and characterized these metalloporphyrins, finding that they significantly increased the settlement of Balanus balanoides and Elminius modestus cyprids. The study aimed to understand the components of oil shale responsible for inducing barnacle settlement and could have implications for marine ecosystems and oil shale research.'
