tldr: The authors study the oscillatory ignition limits in the oxidation of carbon monoxide in an open system. They develop a simplified kinetic mechanism and use stability analysis to predict the oscillatory ignition limits and the oscillatory period between ignition pulses. Their findings can be applied to other isothermal, branched-chain reactions in open systems.
