tldr: This study examines the hydrological processes in a tropical rainforest in Sabah, Malaysia, focusing on throughfall, stemflow, overland flow, and throughflow. The researchers found that 80.7% of the annual precipitation reached the forest floor as throughfall, and 1.9% as stemflow, resulting in an interception loss of 17.4%. The study also highlights the impact of forest disturbance on runoff and soil loss, and the importance of understanding these processes for the conservation and management of tropical rainforests.
