tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the friction of wood and its relation to moisture content. They found that the friction of wood arises from adhesion and deformation, and the moisture content can significantly affect the friction. The sliding friction depends on the moisture content of the wood and the chemical nature of the other surface, while rolling friction is due to internal friction or hysteresis losses in the wood. The study emphasizes the importance of surface structure in the adhesion term of friction in contrast to the deformation term, which is a bulk phenomenon.
