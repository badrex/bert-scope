tldr: This article compares geomagnetic secular variation as recorded by historical, archaeomagnetic, and palaeomagnetic measurements. It discusses the experimental basis of secular variation studies, the geomagnetic dipole, the non-dipole field, and the time variation of the axial dipole magnitude. The study finds that combining results from different approaches can lead to better models of geomagnetic field behavior and extend the record of the Earth's magnetic field far into the past.
