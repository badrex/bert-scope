tldr: The authors present a new approximate method for solving laminar boundary layer equations, which they apply to the flow past a circular cylinder. They compare their method with other existing methods and find that it provides a more accurate solution for the position of separation. The new method is also tested with an accurate solution of a particular problem, showing fairly good agreement.
