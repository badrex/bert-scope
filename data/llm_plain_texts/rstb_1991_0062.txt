tldr: This article examines the ultrastructure and process of spermatogenesis in Antalis entalis, a species of Mollusca. It provides detailed observations and analysis of the changes that occur during spermatogenesis, including the formation of the proacrosome, nuclear condensation, and the role of mitochondria. The study contributes to the understanding of reproductive biology in Mollusca, specifically Scaphopoda.
