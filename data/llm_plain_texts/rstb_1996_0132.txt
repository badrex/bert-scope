tldr: The study investigates the role of the prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex in attention and dual task performance. It shows that these areas are engaged during new learning and problem-solving but not when tasks become automatic. The research also demonstrates that there is more interference when subjects generate verbs than when they repeat nouns during dual task performance.
