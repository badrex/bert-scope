tldr: The authors develop a theory to explain the orientational ordering in uniaxial liquid crystals composed of molecules with alkyl chains. They use the rotameric state model to describe the conformations of the alkyl chains and assume that the potential of mean torque can be represented by a sum of contributions from each rigid group in the molecule. The theory predicts the order parameters for the methylene and methyl groups in the alkyl chains and the conformational distributions for the isotropic and nematic phases of the mesogens. The results do not support the notion that the orientational order of such molecules can be described by a single, cylindrically symmetric ordering matrix.
