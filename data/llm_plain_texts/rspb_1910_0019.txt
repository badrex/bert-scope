tldr: The author's experiments show that living cancer cells can induce active resistance to the implantation of cancer, while mechanically disintegrated cells do not. Disintegrated cells, whether through freezing, grinding, or other methods, do not create immunity or resistance to cancer. This discovery highlights the importance of living cells in cancer immunotherapy and the need for further research on cancer treatments.
