tldr: This study investigates the changes in magnetic properties of meteoric iron and artificial nickel-iron alloys when exposed to varying temperatures. The author demonstrates how these changes can be used to understand the composition and structure of meteoric iron and provide insights into the behavior of nickel-iron alloys. The thermomagnetic method is established as a valuable tool for studying these materials.
