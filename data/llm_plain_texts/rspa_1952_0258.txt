tldr: The study investigates the growth characteristics of yeast when haploids combine and when haploids separate from diploids. The findings show that diploids generally have greater potential for growth than haploids, but the more complex organization needed to exploit these potentialities may be more challenging to establish. The research also suggests that some galactose-negative yeast strains have a secondary galactose-utilizing mechanism that can be developed under appropriate conditions.
