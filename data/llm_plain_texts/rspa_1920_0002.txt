tldr: The author investigates the secondary spectrum of hydrogen and its relationship with helium. They discover that the presence of helium in vacuum tubes significantly alters the intensity and appearance of hydrogen's secondary spectrum, allowing for the segregation of lines into physically related groups. This finding sheds light on the complex nature of the secondary spectrum and its differences from the more well-known Balmer series.
