tldr: 'Peter M. Roget invented a new instrument that performs mechanical involution and evolution of numbers using the principle of the common sliding-rule. The instrument allows for quick calculations of powers and roots, making it useful for various applications, including compound interest, population growth, and temperature reduction. The author also discusses different forms the instrument can take, such as a spiral or other modifications of the common logometric line of Gunter.'
