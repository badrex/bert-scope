tldr: This article presents a method for solving engineering problems related to the flexure and extension of flat elastic plates using biharmonic analysis and relaxation techniques. The authors apply this method to four different cases, discussing the theoretical basis, practical details, and results of their calculations. This approach offers a more efficient alternative to traditional methods, which often require laborious computation and experimental methods like photo-elasticity.
