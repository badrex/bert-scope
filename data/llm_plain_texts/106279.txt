tldr: John Ingenhousz conducted experiments to measure the diminution of bulk when common air mixes with nitrous air. He also studied the magnetism of platinum particles and found that they all have magnetic properties, though weaker than iron. The gold-colored particles of platinum can be turned into round balls resembling real gold through heating.
