tldr: This article describes a new method for determining the viscosity of water using a unique apparatus with rotating cylinders. The experiments show that the force required to turn the inner cylinder is proportional to the velocity and the square of the velocity, with the latter being a small component. The results agree closely with Poiseuille's experiments on the flow of liquids through capillary tubes.
