tldr: The author discusses the importance of functional metabolism in plant growth and energy production. They explain how plants convert carbon dioxide and water into sugar through photosynthesis and use this sugar for growth and energy. The author also highlights the role of respiration in providing energy for vital activities and the differences in metabolic processes between plants and animals.
