tldr: This article investigates the effect of solvents on the reaction velocity between persulphate ions and iodide ions. The authors found that the reaction velocity changes significantly depending on the type of solvent used. They also studied the impact of ionic strength on the reaction and observed that the reaction velocity increases with the increase in ionic strength. The findings provide insights into understanding the role of solvents and ionic strength in chemical reactions.
