tldr: The authors studied the far ultra-violet absorption spectra of various hydrides, deuterides, and methyl derivatives of sulfur, selenium, and tellurium. They found well-developed Rydberg series and identified electronic transitions from non-bonding orbitals. The study provides insights into the effect of alkyl substitution and the changes in electronic structure of these molecules.
