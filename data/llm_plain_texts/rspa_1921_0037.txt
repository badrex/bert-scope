tldr: The author investigates the possibility of enhancing the fuel values of brown coals and lignites through heat treatment at temperatures below 400Â°C. They found that a chemical change occurs in the coals during this process, eliminating steam and carbon dioxide without producing significant amounts of condensable oils or gaseous hydrocarbons. This research could aid in utilizing potential lignite coal resources and improve the fuel situation in various countries.
