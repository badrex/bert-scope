tldr: The author conducted a morphological analysis of various types of Spirochets, including Spirochceta, Cristispira, Treponema, and Saprospira, to determine their systematic position within the classification of living organisms. The author concluded that Spirochets do not belong to the Flagellata or Protozoa, but share similarities with certain forms of Cyanophyceae. The study provides a detailed analysis of the morphology, structure, and life history of these organisms, which is essential for their accurate classification.
