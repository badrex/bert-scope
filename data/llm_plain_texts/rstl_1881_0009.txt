tldr: The author investigates the effects of tidal friction on a planet with multiple satellites, considering the changes in their distances and the planet's rotation over time. The study focuses on the importance of tidal friction in the evolution of planetary masses, particularly in the solar system and its subsystems. The author also discusses the potential impact of mutual perturbations on satellite systems and the possibility of satellites coalescing or colliding.
