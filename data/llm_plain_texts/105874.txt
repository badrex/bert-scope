tldr: This article describes a new species of scaly lizard discovered in the East Indies. The lizard has unique features, such as hard, sharp scales and the ability to kill an elephant by twisting its trunk. It is classified as an ant-eater due to its long, round tongue used to catch ants. The lizard is distinguished from other species by the number of toes and the covering of hair or scales.
