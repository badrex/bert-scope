tldr: The authors developed a detailed theory for the effects of covalency on the magnetic properties of cobalt complexes surrounded by a regular octahedron of ligands. They applied the theory to electron spin resonance measurements on a crystal and compared their results with other authors' findings on different iron group ions. This study provides a deeper understanding of the magnetic behavior of cobalt complexes and their covalent bonding.
