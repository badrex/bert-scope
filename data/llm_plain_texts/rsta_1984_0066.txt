tldr: The Gypsy verification environment is a computer program that supports the development of software systems and formal, mathematical proofs about their behavior. It uses the Gypsy language, based on mathematical foundations, to construct rigorous proofs about specifications and implementations of software systems, providing an objective, scientific way to predict system behavior. This approach aims to improve software engineering predictability and reduce the probability of human error.
