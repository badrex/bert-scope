tldr: The authors investigated the paramagnetic resonance spectrum of copper acetate and found it to be anomalous, resembling that of an ion with spin 1. They proposed that isolated pairs of copper ions interact through exchange forces, forming a lower singlet state and an upper triplet state. This explanation accounts for the unusual susceptibility and paramagnetic resonance spectrum of copper acetate.
