tldr: The authors develop a WKB approximation for Bloch electrons with a periodic potential and a slowly varying potential field. They introduce a pair of auxiliary functions that satisfy a pair of coupled first-order differential equations, which are used to calculate interband tunnelling probability. This method extends the effective-mass approximation for the case of varying energy in allowed bands.
