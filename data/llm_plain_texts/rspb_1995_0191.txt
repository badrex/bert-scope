revised_title: 'Female Pied Flycatchers' Mate Choice Preferences'

  - Bird behavior

  - Sexual selection
  - Ornithology
tldr: 'Female pied flycatchers prefer males with larger song repertoires and more versatile songs, as demonstrated through an experiment where females were given a choice between two males with different song qualities. This preference may be due to the correlation between song complexity and male quality in pied flycatchers, suggesting that females benefit from choosing males with complex songs.'
