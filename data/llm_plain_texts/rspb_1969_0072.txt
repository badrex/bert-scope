tldr: The authors discovered that acetate inhibits the utilization of various sugars, such as glucose and glycerol, by cultures of Aspergillus nidulans. This inhibition occurs due to the end-product of glycolysis, acetyl-coenzyme A, which controls the entry of carbohydrates into the cell. The study shows that Aspergillus nidulans can regulate the rate of sugar uptake and metabolism, providing insights into the organism's ability to adapt to different carbon sources.
