tldr: This study investigates the layered ultrabasic rocks of Rhum Island, Inner Hebrides, and their formation. The rocks are part of a Tertiary igneous complex and are found in a ring-shaped fracture separating them from Torridonian sediments. The research describes the characteristics and composition of the layered series, which is comparable to other basic layered intrusions like the Bushveld, Skaergaard, and Stillwater. The study concludes that the layered rocks formed through the crystallization of magma and the interplay of various factors such as mineral composition, deposition rates, and the presence of interstitial liquid.
