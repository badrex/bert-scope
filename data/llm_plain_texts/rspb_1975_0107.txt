tldr: The study investigates the mesencephalic nucleus of the fifth nerve in selachian fish, focusing on its anatomy and function. The researchers found that these neurons have two functions: as primary sensory cells and as interneurons. They also discovered that the cells in the optic tectum are driven directly by peripheral nerve stimulation, and the sensory nucleus of the fifth nerve is involved in a synaptic pathway. This information provides insights into the neural pathway and reflex organization in these fish.
