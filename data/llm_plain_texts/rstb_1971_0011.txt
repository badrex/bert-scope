tldr: The authors conducted a preliminary survey of Aldabra's vegetation, finding it mostly composed of evergreen or semi-deciduous scrub or scrub-forest, with open areas of grass or sedge meadows. They identified 200 species, with 47 considered exotics, mainly Casuarina, which poses a significant threat to the native vegetation. The authors recommend minimizing the introduction of exotic plants and eventually removing those already present to protect the island's ecosystem.
