tldr: In a letter to Dr. William Hunter, John Boddington describes the discovery of petrified bones in the Rock of Gibraltar. The bones, found while constructing a wall, are identified as belonging to a quadruped and are encased in a brownish-colored calcareous crystallization. The fossilized bones provide valuable insight into the geological history of the region.
