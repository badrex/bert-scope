tldr: The authors use wave mechanics to explain how a spherical wave can produce straight tracks in a Wilson cloud chamber. They consider the -particle and the gas in the chamber as one system, and by analyzing the wave function, they show that straight tracks can only form if the atoms being ionized are in a straight line with the radioactive nucleus. This study helps to understand the behavior of particles in nuclear processes.
