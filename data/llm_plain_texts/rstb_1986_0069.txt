tldr: This article discusses the British contribution to the SCOPE Programme on the Ecology of Biological Invasions, focusing on factors that determine whether a species will become an invader, site properties that make an ecosystem prone or resistant to invasion, and the development of management systems to address these issues. The program's findings have implications for the conservation of natural ecosystems and the management of invasive species in various regions.
