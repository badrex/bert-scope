tldr: The author describes a new instrument that combines the features of a maximum and minimum thermometer, invented by James Hicks. The device uses a mercury-filled vertical tube and a horizontal tube filled with spirits of wine to measure temperature changes. The instrument is capable of registering both maximum and minimum temperatures and provides a check against potential errors. It is a valuable tool for scientific research and weather monitoring.
