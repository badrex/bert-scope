tldr: The author examines the development of excitation between atomic or molecular energy levels under the influence of monochromatic laser radiation, focusing on strictly homogeneous line broadening. The study calculates the ratio of excited atoms or molecules to the total number, providing exact expressions for the situation when the radiation frequency is equal to the transition frequency. Numerical calculations are made for non-zero detuning, and approximate expressions are derived for future research on mixed homogeneous and inhomogeneous line-broadening.
