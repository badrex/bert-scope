tldr: The article examines the seasonal cycle and interannual variability of Southern Ocean sea-ice coverage using satellite passive-microwave data from 1978 to 1987. It highlights the large seasonal cycle with a nearly fivefold increase in ice extents from February to September and significant interannual variations. The study also explores the impacts of these changes on the Antarctic environment, oceanic and atmospheric circulations, and marine life.
