tldr: The author, C. Wheatstone, describes Fessel's gyroscope and its ability to demonstrate combined rotary motions. The gyroscope consists of a beam that can move freely around a horizontal axis, with a rotating disc at one end. The equilibrium of the beam can be disturbed by shifting a weight, causing the disc to rotate and the beam to move as well. Wheatstone explains the principles behind these rotations and how they can be manipulated, providing a deeper understanding of the phenomena of combined rotary motions.
