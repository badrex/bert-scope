tldr: This article presents a comprehensive review of the current understanding of sulphur bacteria, their role in the sulphur cycle, and their impact on the environment. It highlights recent advancements in microbiological and biochemical studies, including the diverse oxidized sulphur compounds that can be reduced to sulphide, and the complex interactions of autotrophy, lithotrophy, heterotrophy, and mixotrophy. The article also discusses the need for further research on oxic-anoxic interface environments and the microbiology of zoocoenoses involving sulphur bacteria.
