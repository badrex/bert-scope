tldr: This article discusses the ultrastructure and cytochemistry of the autonomic nervous system, focusing on large granular vesicles and the storage and release of neurotransmitters, particularly noradrenaline. The author presents findings on the distribution of these vesicles in different types of nerve fibers and the effects of reserpine on their contents. Additionally, the article explores the use of high-resolution autoradiography to study the cytochemistry of noradrenaline in sympathetic neurons.
