tldr: The authors present an analytical solution for the reflection and transmission of waves on a membrane in a compressible fluid wedge of arbitrary angle. They use the Maliuzhinets special function to solve the inhomogeneous difference equation and deduce the membrane wave reflection and transmission coefficients. This study is relevant to structural acoustics, electromagnetism, and other fields involving wave propagation and diffraction.
