tldr: The author investigates the origins and development of the Calcutta cyclone of 1867 by analyzing wind patterns, atmospheric pressure, and temperature data from various locations in the Bay of Bengal. They found that a region of slight barometric depression existed from Sumatra to Arakan, with a minimum to the west of the Nicobars. The author concludes that the cyclone was likely formed due to the diversion of wind currents towards the area of low barometer, and suggests that similar wind patterns may play a role in the production of other cyclones in the region.
