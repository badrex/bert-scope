tldr: This study examines the brain morphology of Aboriginal Australians, focusing on the cerebral structure and its potential relationship to intellectual capacity and racial differences. The research explores the anatomical patterns and their functional significance, as well as the challenges in determining exact homology between sulcal patterns and histologically defined areas. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the brain's structure and its potential implications for cognitive abilities and cultural evolution.
