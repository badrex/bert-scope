tldr: The author examines the arteries of the brain in the spiny anteater (Echidna aculeata) to understand the principles of arterial distribution. They found that the distribution of arteries is precise and that the final areas of arterial supply correspond to structural areas of functional value. The study emphasizes the importance of using correct nomenclature and criteria for homology in understanding arterial distribution.
