tldr: This article discusses the executive and cognitive functions of the prefrontal cortex, comparing the marker hypothesis of Shallice and Burgess to Damasio's somatic marker hypothesis. The authors highlight differences and similarities in the types of representation carried by markers and the degree of obligatoriness in accessing these representations.
