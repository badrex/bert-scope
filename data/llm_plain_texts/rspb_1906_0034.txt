revised_title: 'Enzyme Action and Lipase in Castor-Oil Seeds'
semantic_tags:
  - Enzyme action
  - Lipase
  - Fats hydrolysis
  - Castor-oil seeds
  - Biochemistry
tldr: Dr. Maurice Nicloux and Professor W. D. Halliburton studied the enzyme action in castor-oil seeds, specifically the lipase responsible for breaking down fats. They discovered that the active substance in the cytoplasm of the seeds, which they called "lipase'idine," is not an enzyme but is destroyed by water. This research helped to understand the process of fat breakdown in seeds during germination.
