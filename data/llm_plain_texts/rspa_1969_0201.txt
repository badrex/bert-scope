tldr: The authors analyze one-dimensional approximations to the quantum mechanics of electrons in chain and ring systems, focusing on the effects of electron confinement and the Schrödinger equation. They develop a formalism using a special set of coordinates to demonstrate the impact of confining electron motion near a smooth curve in space and explore the validity of one-dimensional Schrödinger equations in these scenarios.
