tldr: 'The authors conducted calculations of wave functions and energy values for potassium X-ray terms using the self-consistent field method. These calculations provide quantitative data on the alteration of outer wave functions when an electron is removed from an inner group and enable proper calculations of X-ray energy levels. The results can be applied to other X-ray phenomena, such as the Auger effect and X-ray dispersion.'
