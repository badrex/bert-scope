tldr: The author examines various specimens of a unique fossil discovered in Dudley, which resembles an aquatic scutated creature. They compare it to other known invertebrates and crustaceans, but find it to be most similar to M. Klein's insect. The author calls it Scolopendrae aquaticae scutatae affine animal petrifactum, and provides detailed descriptions and illustrations of the fossil's features.
