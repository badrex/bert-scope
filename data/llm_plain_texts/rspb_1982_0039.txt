tldr: The authors conducted clonal analysis on cultured mammary epithelial cells from human milk and discovered that three main types of colony-forming cells, elongated, cuboidal, and open, can maintain their morphological phenotype. They found that the open cell type can differentiate into cuboidal and elongated cells, while the cuboidal type can only differentiate into elongated cells. This study provides insights into the differentiation pathway of mammary epithelial cells and their relation to mammary cancer cells.
