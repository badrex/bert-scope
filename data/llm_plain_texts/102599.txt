tldr: Dr. Cay shares his experience with Dr. Lister about the potential medicinal properties of Ostracites, a type of shell, in treating nephritis. He discusses the effectiveness of the medicine as shared by Dr. Home, who has used it to treat patients with gravel or small stones. The medicine is not a quick solution and requires consistent use, but it has shown promising results in alleviating pain and dissolving small stones. Dr. Cay also mentions the possible uses of other shells and fossils, suggesting that they may have valuable properties yet to be discovered.
