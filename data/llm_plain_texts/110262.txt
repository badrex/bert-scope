tldr: The author conducted experiments on batrachian reptiles to understand the effects of heat on their muscles and nervous systems. They discovered that when the animals were exposed to moderately high temperatures, their muscles contracted and became rigid, leading to the conclusion that the death of the animal was not due to asphyxia but a positive agency affecting the nervous and muscular systems.
