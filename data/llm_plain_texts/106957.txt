tldr: The author conducted experiments on grafting trees to determine the factors affecting their health and fruit production. They found that the health of the parent stock plays a significant role in the success of grafting and the growth of the new tree. The author also observed that trees propagated from seeds tend to have better health and growth than those propagated from cuttings or layers. This research can help improve fruit tree cultivation and increase the success rate of grafting.
