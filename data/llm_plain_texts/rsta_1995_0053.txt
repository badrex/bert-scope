tldr: This article discusses the importance of understanding and predicting the microstructure of high-temperature materials during the solidification process. It presents a macroscopic modeling approach and a stochastic cellular automaton model for simulating grain structure formation in solidification processes. The models help predict the microstructural features and crystallographic textures of high-temperature materials, such as superalloys, used in aerospace applications.
