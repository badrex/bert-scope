tldr: The author investigates the intensity variations of the night sky light when analyzed by color filters. They compare the intensities and their variations in a series of observations at different stations across the globe, using crystals of potassium uranyl sulphate as a standard. The study aims to understand the light emitted by the night sky and its relationship with the colors and filters used in the observations.
