tldr: The authors studied the change in the absorption spectrum of cobalt chloride in aqueous hydrochloric acid solutions as the temperature increased. They found that the transformation from red to blue is limited even with a large increase in temperature, and the absorption spectra of the solutions at different temperatures are similar to those with increasing concentration of hydrochloric acid at constant temperature. This indicates that the final complex produced is the same, and the absorption of the complex increases slightly with increasing temperature.
