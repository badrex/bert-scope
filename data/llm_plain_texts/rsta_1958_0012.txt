tldr: This study investigates the storm surges in the North Sea from 11 to 30 December 1954. The authors analyze the effects of wind patterns and pressure changes on sea levels, finding that winds from the west of the British Isles play a significant role in these events. The research also explores the influence of the Straits of Dover and the existence of seiches, or standing waves, in the sea.
