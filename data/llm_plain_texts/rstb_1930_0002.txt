tldr: This study investigates the development of simple ascidians from a functional perspective, focusing on their physiology and embryology. The research covers various aspects of ascidian development, including hatching mechanisms, perivitelline structures, and the role of outer follicle cells in egg floatation. The findings contribute to a better understanding of tunicate development and marine biology.
