tldr: The author, Edward Sabine, presents the results of magnetic observations made during the Antarctic Expedition led by Captain Sir James Clark Ross. The observations were conducted on board the ships Erebus and Terror, and the data collected was used to determine the constants a and b for calculating the corrections of the declination. The author also discusses the differences in the values of these constants when the ship was sailing from lower to higher latitudes and vice versa, and proposes a table for the correction of observations during this period.
