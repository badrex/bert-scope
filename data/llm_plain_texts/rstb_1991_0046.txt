tldr: The authors describe an experimental approach to study protein folding and stability using protein engineering and kinetic measurements. They focus on barnase, an RNAse from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, to analyze the folding pathway and the role of individual side chains in stabilizing the folded, transition, and intermediate states of the protein. The findings provide insights into the essence of enzymic catalysis and the structure of folding intermediates.
