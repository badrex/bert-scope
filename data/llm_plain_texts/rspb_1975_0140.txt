tldr: The study investigates the otolith-controlled response of first-order neurons in the bullfrog's labyrinth to changes in linear acceleration. The experiments reveal that these neurons respond to tilting movements, showing an output related to the direction and velocity of the movements. The results contribute to understanding the complex mechanics and nonlinearities of the otolith organ and its receptor units in the bullfrog's vestibular system.
