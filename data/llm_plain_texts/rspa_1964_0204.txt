tldr: 'The authors used the Ariel I satellite to study the energy spectrum of heavy primary cosmic rays. They employed a Cerenkov counter to differentiate between protons and heavy nuclei, finding that the integral spectrum shows a well-defined slope near the rigidity interval of 1.6 x 10^13 V, indicating the upper limit of the solar modulation process at that time. The results provide valuable information on the large-scale configuration of the interplanetary magnetic field and its variations with solar activity.'
