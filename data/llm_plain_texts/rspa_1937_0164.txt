tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the condensation of potassium and sodium on tungsten surfaces and their effects on contact potentials. They investigated the contact potential differences using the contact-potential method and discussed the importance of experimental conditions for accurate measurements. The study provides insights into the adsorption of gases and the mechanism of chemical reactivity at such surfaces.
