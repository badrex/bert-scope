tldr: This study investigates the brittle-ductile transition in silicon through experiments and observations. Researchers determined the fracture stresses of silicon specimens containing semicircular surface cracks over a range of temperatures and strain rates. The results showed a sharp transition in the material's behavior, associated with the sudden growth of well-defined dislocation arrays from the precursor flaw before fracture. The experiments suggest that a "nucleation" event precedes the generation of dislocation avalanches, and static tests reveal that dislocations can be made to move from crack tips at lower stress values. Above the transition region, general plasticity occurs, with slip being concentrated around the precursor flaw.
