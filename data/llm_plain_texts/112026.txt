tldr: The author conducted experiments on various animals and observed humans to study the functions of the cerebellum. They discovered that the cerebellum, along with the cerebrum, plays a crucial role in voluntary motor control and coordination. The cerebellum is responsible for maintaining balance and adjusting muscle movements, while the cerebrum controls more impulsive, conscious movements. The experiments also showed that the cerebellum does not affect common sensations, sexual propensity, or involuntary muscle actions.
