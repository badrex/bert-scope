tldr: The author, Peter Barlow, describes the construction and testing of a refracting telescope with a fluid concave lens, which has a larger aperture than other telescopes in the country. The telescope is mounted on a revolving stand and can be used for observing stars, planets, and the moon. Barlow also discusses the protective observatory he built for the telescope and the adjustments made to minimize the secondary spectrum.
