tldr: The author studied the habits and structure of the Anaspidid crustaceans from Tasmania, providing insights into their anatomy, habitat, and breeding habits. The Anaspidid species have unique characteristics that set them apart from other Malacostraca, leading the author to propose a new classification for this group, the Syncarida. The author also discovered that Anaspidids lay their eggs individually, a behavior not seen in other crustaceans.
