tldr: Researchers discovered that female-to-male sex change in a coral reef fish, the bluehead wrasse, can occur without the need for gonads. By surgically removing the ovaries of female fish and making them socially dominant, the fish still exhibited male behaviors such as courtship and spawning. This finding challenges the idea that gonadal influences are necessary for behavioral sex change in vertebrates.
