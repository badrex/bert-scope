tldr: The author investigates the propagation of gravitational waves as discussed by Einstein. They find that genuine gravitational waves, called transverse-transverse waves, travel at the speed of light, while other types of waves, such as longitudinal-longitudinal and longitudinal-transverse waves, do not have a fixed velocity. The author also examines the source of these waves and concludes that they arise from secondary disturbances in the distribution of matter.
