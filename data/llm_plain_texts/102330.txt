tldr: 'A boy suddenly died from vomiting, and an autopsy revealed a large polypus in the left ventricle of the heart, inflamed pleura, and a worm in the stomach. The boy's sudden death was likely caused by these abnormalities. The author refers to the works of Malpighi and others for further explanation on polypus formation.'
