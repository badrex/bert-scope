tldr: This article presents a mathematical model that explains how pea moths navigate to pheromone traps in a crop field. The model takes into account the physical effects of the crop on the pheromone plume and the role of the crop in absorbing and re-emitting pheromones. The model helps predict the behavior of pea moths and can be used to improve the placement of pheromone traps in crop fields.
