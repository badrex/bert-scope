tldr: The author analyzed nine photographs of the corona taken during a solar eclipse in Tunisia to study the distribution of blue and violet light. They found that the intensity of the corona decreases inversely as the fourth power of the average distance from the sun's limb. This research helps to understand the luminosity of the corona and its relation to solar radiation.
