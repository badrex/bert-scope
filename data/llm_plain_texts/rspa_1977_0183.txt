tldr: The authors demonstrate the use of holographic interferometry to study the flow of stratified fluids, such as those found in atmospheric and oceanic phenomena. They towed horizontal cylinders through linearly stratified fluids and observed the resulting isopycnic patterns, which are equivalent to streamlines under these conditions. The technique provides high-resolution mappings of isopycnic lines in steady, two-dimensional stratified flows, revealing the detailed structure of the flow and allowing for comparison with theoretical models.
