tldr: This article presents specific heat measurements of pure metals (Cu, Ag, Pt, Al, Ni, Fe, Co) at low temperatures using a new calorimeter. The authors analyze the results to detect lattice and spin wave contributions to the specific heat and evaluate the nuclear contribution and effective field for cobalt. The experimental precision is improved by refining techniques, particularly thermometry, following the implementation of the 1958 4He temperature scale.
