tldr: This study investigates the upper frequency limit for the binaural localization of a pure tone by phase difference. The research shows that at medium frequencies, up to about 1000 Hz, definite shifts in the apparent position of a sound source can be produced by phase differences alone when the intensity at the two ears is equal. Above this frequency, localization by phase difference becomes more uncertain, and above about 1400 Hz, it entirely fails. The study concludes that the basis of normal auditory localization for medium frequencies is the time interval between the arrival of corresponding phases in each cycle of the sound wave at the two ears.
