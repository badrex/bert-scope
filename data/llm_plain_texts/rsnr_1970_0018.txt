tldr: 'The article discusses the scientific endeavors of Colin Campbell and Alexander Macfarlane in Jamaica during the 18th century. Both Campbell and Macfarlane were educated at the University of Glasgow and were elected as Fellows of the Royal Society. Campbell attempted to establish an observatory in Jamaica, while Macfarlane later acquired Campbell's collection of astronomical instruments and built his own observatory. Although they made some observations, their scientific activities did not yield significant results or publications.'
