tldr: 'The article describes the development of an aerial application system for controlling Desert Locusts in eastern Africa. The system was designed to meet the challenges of surveying locust populations, finding effective regulators, and applying them on a large scale. Aerial survey proved to be the most efficient method for locating both hopper infestations and locust swarms, allowing for targeted control measures and reducing the reliance on standard pest management practices like spraying crops.'
