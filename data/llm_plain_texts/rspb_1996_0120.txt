tldr: 'The study examines the effects of 8-Br-cGMP and carbon monoxide on odour responses of salamander olfactory receptor neurons. The results show that 8-Br-cGMP strongly down-regulates the odour sensitivity of the cells, with a Ki of 460 nM. This adaptation-like effect can be mimicked by CO, an activator of soluble guanylyl cyclase, with a Ki of 1 pM. The study proposes that cGMP helps to prevent saturation of the cell's response by adjusting the operational range of the cAMP cascade and contributes to olfactory adaptation by decreasing the sensitivity of olfactory receptor cells to repeated odour stimuli.'
