tldr: The author conducted experiments using the electric coherence method to study adsorption from liquids and gases on plane metallic surfaces. They found that the net heat of desorption is proportional to the moment of the adsorbed molecules and the specific inductive capacity of the film. This supports the dipole theory of adsorption, which suggests that molecules are attracted to and held on the surface by the electrical image of their dipoles in the surface.
