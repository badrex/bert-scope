tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the factors affecting the amount of infection obtained by aphid transmission of the virus Hy. They found that the efficiency of infection depends on various factors such as the susceptibility of the plants, the concentration of the virus, and the means of infection. The study used tobacco plants and Hyoscyamus plants to compare their susceptibility and efficiency as sources of infection. The results showed that tobacco plants were slightly more susceptible than Hyoscyamus plants, and there was no significant difference in efficiency between the two plant species as sources of infection.
