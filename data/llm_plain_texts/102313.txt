tldr: The author, Hans Sloane, discovered four types of strange beans frequently washed ashore on the Orkney Isles. These beans were also found in Jamaica, leading Sloane to theorize that ocean currents brought them from the Caribbean to Scotland. The beans were used to make snuff boxes and had various names, such as "Cocoons," "HorseEye-Bean," and "Ash-coloured-Nickar." Sloane also discussed the possibility that these beans played a role in Christopher Columbus's motivation to discover the New World.
