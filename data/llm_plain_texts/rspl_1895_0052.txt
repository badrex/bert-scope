tldr: The author presents a method for calibrating the capillary electrometer, which measures rapid variations in potential difference. The process involves capturing photographs of the electrometer's excursions and analyzing the resulting polar curves to determine the acting potential difference and sub-normal values. This method allows for the calibration of various types of dead-beat elements and can be applied to different capillaries, making it a valuable tool for measuring electromotive changes of short duration.
