tldr: The authors compare the gastric organs of Spirula, Nautilus, and various Gastropods, finding similarities in their stomach structures. They suggest that these primitive structures indicate a common ancestor for both Cephalopods and Gastropods, and that the different modifications in specialized mollusk groups can be traced back to the Cambrian period.
