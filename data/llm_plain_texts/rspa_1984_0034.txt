tldr: The article discusses space-times with two-index Killing spinors and their properties. It shows that these space-times are conformally related to metrics with separable Hamilton-Jacobi and scalar wave equations. The study also explores conditions for non-scalar wave equations to have separable solutions with relations between components of opposite helicity.
