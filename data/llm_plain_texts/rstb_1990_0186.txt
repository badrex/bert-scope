tldr: This article discusses the evolution of population regulation and dynamics in ecology, from Gilbert White's initial inquiry in 1778 to the development of models like the Lotka-Volterra and Nicholson-Bailey models. It highlights the importance of understanding the interplay between local populations and the environment, as well as the role of chaos theory in explaining population fluctuations. The author emphasizes the need for long-term, comprehensive studies to monitor populations and detect the impact of environmental changes.
