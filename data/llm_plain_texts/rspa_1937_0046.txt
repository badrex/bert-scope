tldr: The article investigates atmospheric oscillations and their relationship with tidal forces. The author proposes a theory that the atmosphere has two modes of free oscillations with periods of 10 and 12 hours, depending on the temperature distribution. This theory conflicts with the resonance theory, but it can explain the observed pressure oscillations and the earth's magnetic field variations. The study also discusses the forced tidal oscillations of a horizontally uniform atmosphere and the effects of conductivity and viscosity on the vertical distribution of motion.
