tldr: The authors provide a comprehensive survey of experimental techniques, results, and theoretical interpretations of self-dissociation and protonic charge transport in water and ice. They discuss the differences in proton transport between water and ice, explaining the mechanisms of structural diffusion and charge transfer within hydrogen bonds. The findings have implications for understanding reaction kinetics in protolytic systems and biological problems.
