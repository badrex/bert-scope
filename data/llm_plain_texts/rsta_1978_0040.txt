tldr: This article discusses the relationship between terrestrial heat and magma generation, with a focus on the lunar core hypothesis. The authors present transfer functions based on seismic surface wave theory for a 3-layer Moon with varying core conductivities. They explore the possibility of a lunar metal core and provide revised data on core sizes and conductivities.
