tldr: Sir David Brewster examines the phenomena of parallel bands of light and shade exhibited by reflection at the plane surface of a diamond. He concludes that they result from the reflections of the edges of veins or laminas, which are inclined at different angles to the general surface. He also discusses analogous facts observable in other crystals, particularly those of carbonate of lime.
