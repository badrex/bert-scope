tldr: The study investigates the influence of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT; serotonin) on the neural network underlying swimming during early post-embryonic life in Xenopus tadpoles. The results show that the sensitivity of the swimming rhythm to exogenous 5HT follows a strict rostrocaudal gradient, suggesting that a functional endogenous 5HT system may have an important role in the ontogeny and subsequent modulation of Xenopus swimming motor output.
