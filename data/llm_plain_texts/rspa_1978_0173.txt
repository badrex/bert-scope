tldr: The article investigates an incompressible laminar flow over a spinning blunt body of revolution at incidence, considering the Magnus effect. The study uses three-dimensional boundary layer theory and provides complete numerical solutions for an ellipsoid of revolution at incidence and two spin rates. Spinning causes asymmetry, which introduces the Magnus force, affecting crossflow, skin friction, and displacement thickness. The Magnus forces due to crossflow skin friction and centrifugal pressure are determined, showing partial compensation for each other. At lower spin rates, the frictional force is larger, resulting in a positive Magnus force, while at high spin rates, the opposite occurs.
