tldr: The authors developed a new method to measure intraocular pressure using a specially designed needle. They found that the average intraocular pressure is higher than previously thought, and it is not affected by changes in general venous pressure. The intraocular pressure is related to arterial pressure and is influenced by factors such as carotid artery ligation, abdominal aorta compression, and spinal cord section.
