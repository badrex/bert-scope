tldr: The authors investigated the properties of silver-cadmium alloys for use in creating uniform trial plates for testing the fineness of silver coin and wares. They found that these alloys were more suitable than silver-copper alloys due to their homogeneity and ease of assay. The authors also detailed the process of creating these alloys and their properties, such as their ductility and whiteness.
