tldr: The author explores prepotentials and potential integrals in physics, focusing on three main cases: prepotential-plane, potential-plane, and potential-surface. The study of these integrals helps in understanding the distribution of matter and forces in various physical scenarios, such as the attractions of ellipsoids.
