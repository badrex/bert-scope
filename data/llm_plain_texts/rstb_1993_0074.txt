tldr: The authors isolated and characterized cDNAs encoding proteins that interact with SRF (serum response factor) and form a ternary complex with p62/TCF at the serum response element (SRE). This study provides insight into the role of the ternary complex in SRE function and suggests a mechanism by which the complex links activation of transcription to signals from the cell surface.
