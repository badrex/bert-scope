tldr: The author explains the significance of electrode potential and its relation to metal basigenity. They introduce the concept of electron affinity and use it to derive a formula that connects electrode potential with the basigenic properties of metals. The study of electrode potential and its relation to metal properties can help improve our understanding of electrochemical processes and the behavior of metals in various environments.
