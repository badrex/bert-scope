tldr: This article examines the extensional and compressional tectonics associated with convergent plate boundaries, focusing on the Aegean Arc and the Andean Cordillera. The study reveals that the compressional deformation in the crust above subduction zones is strongly controlled by stress conditions along convergent boundaries, and extensional tectonics are associated with subduction zones.
