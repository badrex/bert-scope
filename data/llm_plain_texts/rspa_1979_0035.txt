tldr: The authors studied the resonance line of 553.5 nm of barium using Doppler-free spectroscopy and a dye laser. They measured the isotope shifts and hyperfine structure in the line to high precision, providing data to reduce uncertainties in the extraction of nuclear data from optical measurements. The results were combined with other data to extract changes in the mean square radius of the nuclear charge distribution and to determine the quadrupole moment of the nucleus.
