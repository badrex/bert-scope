tldr: 'The author investigates the process of drug resistance in the fungus Penicillium roqueforti Thom. They find that the organism can acquire high resistance to various toxic substances, such as phenylmercuric acetate, proflavine, and brilliant green, through repeated subculturing. However, the resistance is generally unstable, and the organism quickly loses it when grown in drug-free medium. The author concludes that the process of resistance in fungi, bacteria, and yeasts is similar, and that a mutation theory would require an improbably high mutation rate to explain the observed resistance patterns.'
