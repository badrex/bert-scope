tldr: 'George Davidson discovered a new species of the Bark-Tree in the island of St. Lucia, which possesses the virtues of the Jesuit's Bark. The new species is a Cinchona, but not the Cinchona officinalis of Linnaeus. It has an emetic quality, a different bark texture, and a bitter taste resembling Gentian. The tree grows in a specific environment and has medicinal properties, making it a valuable find for potential medical uses.'
