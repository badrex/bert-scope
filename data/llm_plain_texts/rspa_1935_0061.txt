tldr: The authors conducted a thorough examination of the fine structures in the spark and arc spectra of iodine to determine the nuclear spin of iodine. They found that the nuclear spin is 5/2 by analyzing the fine structure term multiplicity and comparing the interval factors of different terms. This study provides a better understanding of iodine's atomic structure and contributes to the field of atomic physics.
