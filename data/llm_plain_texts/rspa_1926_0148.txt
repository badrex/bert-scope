tldr: The authors study the homogeneous decomposition of gaseous propionic aldehyde and find it to be a unimolecular reaction. They discover that the reaction is almost completely homogeneous and that the velocity constant falls off at pressures below 80 mm Hg. The decomposition products consist mainly of methane, ethane, and carbon dioxide, with small amounts of other more condensed products. The reaction is found to be more nearly of the first order than any other order, and the influence of foreign gases is found to be negligible.
