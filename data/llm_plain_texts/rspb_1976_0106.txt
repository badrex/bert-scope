tldr: This article discusses the prospects of developing male contraceptives, focusing on hormonal interference and spermatogenesis suppression. The authors explore the use of androgens, progestagens, and oestrogens, either alone or in combination, to temporarily interrupt male fertility. They also discuss the potential of compounds that selectively suppress FSH levels, which may enable spermatogenic suppression without affecting androgenic function. The article highlights the need for further research to develop safe and effective male contraceptives.
