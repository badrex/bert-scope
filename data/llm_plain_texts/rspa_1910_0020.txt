tldr: The authors present a method to approximate the solution of physical problems involving differential equations using finite differences. They apply this method to calculate the stress function in a masonry dam. The process involves replacing analysis with arithmetic, representing continuous functions with numbers, and using central differences for differentials. The error due to finite central differences can be made small, and more exact values can be extrapolated.
