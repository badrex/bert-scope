tldr: This article discusses the effects of gravity on the human circulatory system and how the body adapts to weightlessness. It explains how hydrostatic pressure differences and reflex responses affect the circulation, and how the body makes adjustments to maintain adequate blood flow to the brain. The article also explores the implications of weightlessness on the cardiovascular system and the potential for cardiovascular deconditioning in astronauts.
