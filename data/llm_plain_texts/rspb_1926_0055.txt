tldr: The authors conducted experiments to improve the diagnosis of Kala Azar, a disease caused by Leishmania parasites. They tested two existing methods, the "aldehyde reaction" and the "globulin precipitation test," and found them to be effective in identifying the disease in 92.9% and 98% of cases, respectively. They also studied the effect of human blood on the parasites and found that it can immobilize and destroy them. However, they discovered that this "destruction" might be more apparent than real, as some parasites can withstand the effects of the blood. The authors also investigated the complement levels in Kala Azar patients and found no significant increase compared to healthy individuals. They suggested that a complement fixation test using an infected hamster spleen antigen might be useful in diagnosing the disease.
