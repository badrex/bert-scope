revised_title: Ordered Bicontinuous Films and Biological Membranes: Curved Surfaces in Chemical Structure
semantic_tags:
  - Bicontinuous Films
  - Amphiphiles
  - Triply Periodic Minimal Surfaces
  - Biological Membranes
  - Surface Curvature
tldr: This article explores the ordered bicontinuous films of amphiphiles and their relation to biological membranes. It examines the complex topologies of these films, specifically triply periodic minimal surfaces, and how they separate space into two infinite subspaces without self-intersection. The analysis shows how local order constrains global order and how these structures can be found in both liquid crystals and biological systems.
