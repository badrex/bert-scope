tldr: The authors developed an apparatus to measure the photochemical rate of uptake of sulphur dioxide by styrene solutions and studied the kinetics of the copolymerization of styrene and sulphur dioxide. They found that the reaction involves mutual termination of two radicals and examined possible structures for the complex radical. The thermal reaction and uncatalyzed photo-reaction of the system were also discussed.
