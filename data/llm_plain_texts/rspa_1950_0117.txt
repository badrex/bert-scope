tldr: This article investigates the electrical resistivity of beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, and barium at low temperatures. It discusses the experimental methods, results, and the behavior of these alkaline earth metals. The study also examines the effect of magnetic fields on the resistance of magnesium and the phenomenon of resistance increase at very low temperatures.
