tldr: The author conducted experiments on dogs and monkeys to study the effects of partial thyroidectomy. They found that removing the parathyroid glands caused symptoms similar to those produced by removing the entire thyroid gland. The author also observed eye symptoms in some animals, such as narrowing of the palpebral fissures and recession of the eyeballs. These findings suggest that the parathyroid glands play a significant role in the body's function and health.
