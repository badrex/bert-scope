tldr: The Royal Society Expedition to southern Chile aimed to study the ecology and biogeography of the region. The team focused on ecological primary surveys and collected data on the vegetation, marine life, and invertebrate fauna. The expedition provided valuable insights into the distribution of species and the relationships between different regions, contributing to the understanding of biogeographical patterns in the southern temperate zone.
