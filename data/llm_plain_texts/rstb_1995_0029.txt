tldr: The authors describe the discovery of articulated halkieriid fossils from the Lower Cambrian of North Greenland, which played a significant role in early protostome evolution. They propose that these early animals are related to the annelids, brachiopods, and molluscs, providing new insights into the diversification of life during the Cambrian explosion.
