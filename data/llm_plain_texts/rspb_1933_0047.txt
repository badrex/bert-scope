tldr: The authors studied the antiseptic and trypanocidal properties of anil and styryl derivatives of 4 amino quinaldine. They found that some compounds had strong antiseptic actions on staphylococci, while others showed trypanocidal effects. The study highlights the importance of chemical structure in determining biological action in closely related compounds.
