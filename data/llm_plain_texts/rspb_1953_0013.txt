tldr: The author discusses the Pauling-Corey models for protein structure, focusing on their application to fibrous proteins. They explore the a-helix model and its compatibility with various protein structures, including a-keratin, haemoglobin, and synthetic polypeptides. The author also addresses criticisms and alternative models, ultimately supporting the a-helix as a significant and versatile structure in biology.
