tldr: The authors examined the reflecting materials in the tapeta lucida of three teleost fish species: bay anchovy, gizzard shad, and pigfish. They identified the reflecting materials as different substances in each species, including triglycerides, guanine, and a reduced pteridine. This study provides insights into the variety and common characteristics of retinal reflectors in teleost fish eyes.
