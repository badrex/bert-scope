tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the influence of nitrogen on plant growth and decay. They found that seeds with a higher nitrogen content germinate faster, and plants with more nitrogen in their roots and stems tend to decay faster. The author also discovered that the chemical composition of plants changes as they grow, with nitrogen playing a crucial role in their functions and health.
