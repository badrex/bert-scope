tldr: The authors investigated the crystal structure and molecular arrangement of isatin using X-ray diffraction. They found that the molecules are arranged in pairs with an O-N distance of 2.8 Ã… and are oriented in a way that suggests the presence of hydrogen bonds or "amino" bonds between molecules. The study provides insight into the structure of isatin and related compounds.
