tldr: The author, David Brewster, discovered new properties of light and optical phenomena in mother of pearl and other bodies with similar surface structures. He found that the two surfaces of mother of pearl have opposite poles and that the angle of aberration increases with the angle of incidence. The author also observed that the transmitted extraordinary ray is bent towards the same pole as the extraordinary reflected ray. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the interaction between light and materials with specific surface structures.
