tldr: The author, Sir Everard Home, conducted experiments to determine the coagulating power of the secretion from the gastric glands in various animals. He found that the gastric glands possess the power to coagulate milk and communicate this property to adjacent parts. This research helps to understand the process of digestion and the role of gastric glands in it.
