tldr: This article discusses the concept of frequency-dependent selection in bacterial populations, which can result in either the maintenance of stable polymorphisms or the purging of variation and the persistence of monomorphic populations. The author presents examples of disruptive and stabilizing frequency-dependent selection in bacteria, such as the production of allelopathic agents and the detoxification of toxins, and reviews the results of theoretical and experimental studies on these phenomena.
