tldr: The author demonstrates that the two-dimensional free-fermion model is equivalent to a checkerboard Ising model, which is a special case of the general '-invariant' Ising model. Expressions for the partition function and local correlations are given in terms of those of the regular square lattice Ising model. The self-dual Potts model is also discussed, and the application of the methods to the three-dimensional Zamolodchikov model is considered.
