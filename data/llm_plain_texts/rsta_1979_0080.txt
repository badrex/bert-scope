tldr: This article discusses the use of mass spectrometry in analyzing complex mixtures of lipids, or geolipids, found in aquatic sediments, both recent and ancient. Mass spectrometry has proven to be an essential tool in understanding the composition and history of these lipids, which can act as biological markers or "chemical fossils" that reflect their environment of deposition and the geological processes they have undergone. The article highlights the importance of mass spectrometry in studying the fate of organic compounds in aquatic environments and the potential for new techniques to reveal previously unknown complexities in these mixtures.
