tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the infra-red absorption spectra of pyrone derivatives. They used a Paschen galvanometer and two Hilger infra-red spectrometers to analyze the absorption bands of various pyrone compounds. The study aimed to explore the possibilities of infra-red spectra in organic chemistry and to elucidate the problem of the molecular refractivity of pyrone compounds. The results showed that some pyrone compounds possess unique properties, such as being basic and forming salts, acids, and possessing a rare oxygen atom that is presumably quadrivalent. The authors also discussed the challenges faced during the experiments, such as controlling the sensitivity and temperature fluctuations, and the methods used to overcome them.
