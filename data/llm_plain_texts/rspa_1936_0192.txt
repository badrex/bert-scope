tldr: 'This article presents calculations that reveal 1041 zeros of the Riemann Zeta-function between 0 and 1, all lying on the line. The author thanks Dr. L. J. Comrie for planning and supervising the calculations, which were carried out using various machines. The results provide encouragement for those who believe in the Riemann Hypothesis, but some features of the table may still be of interest to those who do not.'
