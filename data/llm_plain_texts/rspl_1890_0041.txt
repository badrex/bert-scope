tldr: The author presents a method for analyzing tidal observations of high and low water using harmonic analysis. The method involves taking means over specific periods to account for the complex interactions between the moon, sun, and Earth, and provides a way to reduce a series of observations without prior knowledge of tidal theory. The author demonstrates the method using a three-month series of observations at Bombay.
