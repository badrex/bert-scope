tldr: This article discusses the relationship between the Earth's climate and the variability of the Sun over recent millennia. Geophysicists, archaeologists, and other experts explore the potential links between climate changes, solar activity, and human migration. They also examine the use of various methods, such as tree rings and ice cores, to study these connections and understand the Earth's past and future climate trends.
