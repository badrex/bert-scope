tldr: The article presents a unifying theory for effective field models in magnetism, focusing on the problem of interacting magnetic sub-lattices. The new approach allows for the incorporation of crystal field effects, isotropic and anisotropic exchange, and non-collinear exchange within a three-dimensional framework. The theory covers various effective field models, including the Neel model of ferrimagnetism and the generalized molecular field model.
