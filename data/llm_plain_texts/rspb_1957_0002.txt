tldr: The author discusses the biochemical organization and structure of the bacterial cell, highlighting its unique features such as the cell wall, cytoplasm, and the lack of a clear nucleus. The bacterial cell is a single biological unit that synthesizes all components of protoplasm in an organized and controlled fashion. The cell wall provides strength and rigidity, while the osmotic pressure within the cell is maintained by high concentrations of essential nutrients and metabolites.
