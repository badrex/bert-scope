tldr: This article discusses the thermodynamics of multi-phase chemical systems that can sustain non-hydrostatic stresses. It introduces mechanical coordinates to measure work done on the system due to strain and chemical actions. The author develops a Gibbs function that can be used to determine the conditions of equilibrium for various processes, such as solid/liquid interfaces, coherent phase transformations, and diffusion into a solid. The theory is applied to examples like quartz transitions and crystal twinning systems.
