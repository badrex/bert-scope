tldr: The authors studied the dissociation of water vapour in dilute argon mixtures behind shock waves. They used a short-duration flash absorption technique to follow the growth of OH concentration and constructed profiles of OH concentration for various conditions. The results indicate that water decomposition proceeds by a specific reaction, and the rate constants for this reaction were determined over a temperature range. This provides an assessment of the recombination rate of OH radicals, which is essential for controlling heat release in flame systems.
