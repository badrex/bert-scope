tldr: The author discusses the mechanisms and evolutionary origins of variable X-chromosome activity in mammals. This phenomenon, known as X-chromosome inactivation, allows males and females to have the same gene dosage of X-linked genes. The author explores the medical implications of this mechanism, such as genetic counseling and understanding cancer, and examines the differences between eutherian mammals and marsupials in terms of X-chromosome inactivation. The main focus of the paper is on understanding the theoretical interest of X-inactivation as a system for regulating gene activity in development and its evolutionary origin.
