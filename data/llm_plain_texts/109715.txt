tldr: Humphry Davy investigates the chemical properties and combinations of oxymuriatic gas and oxygen. He discovers that oxymuriatic gas has a strong affinity for inflammable bases, forming binary compounds. Davy also explores the reactions of oxymuriatic gas with various metals and their oxides, and discusses the need for a new nomenclature for oxymuriatic gas and its compounds.
