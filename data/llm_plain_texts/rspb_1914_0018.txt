tldr: The authors conducted experiments on dogs to study the restoration of paralyzed muscles through nerve anastomosis. They found that when the nerve supply of one muscle group is eliminated, the nerve supply of its antagonistic group can be used to supply both groups, allowing for coordinated movements to be restored. The research also showed that recovery of function is slower when one nerve supply is eliminated compared to nerve-crossing experiments, and that the brain adapts to the new conditions in both cases.
