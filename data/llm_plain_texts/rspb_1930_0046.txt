tldr: The corpora lutea of mice were studied during the oestrous cycle to understand fat accumulation and its role in the cycle. The authors found that fat begins to accumulate in the lutein cells after a certain period of growth and functional activity. The outer parts of the corpus luteum have less efficient vascularization, which may be due to developmental conditions. The study provides insights into the complex fat and lipoid changes in the corpus luteum during the oestrous cycle.
