tldr: The article investigates the dynamic behavior of impulsively started axisymmetric flow between a porous injector and an impermeable substrate. The authors provide approximate analytical solutions for short-time dynamics and analyze the intermediate and long-time dynamics using numerical methods. Inertial oscillations are observed in the flow near the impermeable substrate, with the nature of these oscillations depending on the Reynolds number. The implications of inertial oscillations for electrochemical materials processing are discussed.
