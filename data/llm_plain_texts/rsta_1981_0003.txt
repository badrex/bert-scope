tldr: This article presents a theoretical model for the sliding of glaciers in the absence of cavitation. The authors analyze the flow and temperature problems in the basal ice and bedrock, and propose a relation between the basal velocity and the resistance to motion by the bedrock. The model considers the effects of bedrock roughness and regelation, and provides estimates for the sliding law. The study highlights the importance of further research to improve the model's accuracy and incorporate additional factors, such as moisture in the ice.
