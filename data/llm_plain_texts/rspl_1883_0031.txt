tldr: The author describes a new type of arenaceous Rhizopoda, Syringammina fragilissima, found in the Faroe Channel during the "Triton" cruise. The fragile organism has a test composed of fine sand with little to no inorganic cement, and its unique structure and habitat make it an important discovery in the field of marine biology.
