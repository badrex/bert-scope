tldr: The authors analyze the dynamics of cyclones and anticyclones as atmospheric vortices, considering the motion of air under balanced forces and the effects of the earth's rotation. They discuss the gradient wind equation and the relationship between pressure gradients and the "deviating force." The study concludes that cyclones and anticyclones are local modifications of the circumpolar rotation, with vorticity being enhanced or diminished in these systems.
