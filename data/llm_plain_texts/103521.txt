tldr: The author, Isaac Greenwood, describes two instances of deadly effects of vitiated air on animal life and conducts experiments to study the properties of damps. He observes the effects of damps on lights, flames, and animal life, and discusses the elasticity and moisture of the air in the well. The author also mentions a sudden subterranean vapor incident in a well in Schoolhouse-Street, Boston, and its effects on two workers. These experiments and observations contribute to the understanding of the dangers of toxic gases and environmental hazards.
