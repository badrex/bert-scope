tldr: This article explores the oscillatory motion of fluids in circular tubes, focusing on the effects of viscosity and pressure on the fluid's behavior. The authors develop a theoretical framework to understand and predict the oscillations, which can be applied to various practical situations, such as viscometry and fluid dynamics in pipes.
