tldr: The authors analyze the absorption spectrum of naphthalene vapour and explain the structure and activation of the naphthalene molecule. They identify three types of absorption spectra based on the quantification of electronic, atomic, and molecular motions. The study contributes to understanding the behavior of molecules and the mechanism of absorption spectra.
