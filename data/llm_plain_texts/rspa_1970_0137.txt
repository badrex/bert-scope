tldr: This article presents a detailed study of the chemical exchange effects in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of quadrupolar nuclei, focusing on the aqueous trichloride ion system. The authors apply the modified Bloch equations to analyze the exchange processes and obtain closed expressions for three-site and four-site cases. They also discuss the temperature and concentration dependence of the line broadening parameter, which helps in determining the kinetic data of the system.
