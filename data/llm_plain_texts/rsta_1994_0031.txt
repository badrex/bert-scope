tldr: The authors present an alternative approach to statistical energy analysis called wave intensity analysis, which models the directional dependence of the vibrational wave intensity in each structural component using a Fourier series. This method improves estimates of the vibrational energy levels in engineering structures, especially in cases where the directional filtering effect of structural junctions leads to non-diffuse wavefields. The authors apply the method to various plate structures and demonstrate a significant improvement over conventional SEA.
