tldr: This article investigates how biological interactions affect the patchiness of plankton populations in the sea, considering the role of physical processes such as turbulence and diffusion. The authors develop a general model to understand how biological interactions modify spatial patterns and discuss the comparison with terrestrial environments. The study highlights the importance of understanding the coupling between biology and physics in the ocean.
