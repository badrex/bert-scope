tldr: The authors studied the absorption spectra of alkali metal vapors, specifically potassium, rubidium, and caesium. They discovered 15 new lines in the potassium spectrum, 20 in the rubidium spectrum, and 11 in the caesium spectrum. The study aimed to test various formulas for the wavelengths of series lines, including the Rydberg formula, and to understand the behavior of the absorption spectra under varying conditions.
