tldr: The author discusses the importance of understanding tides and their impact on coastal areas. They present observations and calculations to determine the establishment of a port, the fundamental hour, and the constant that contains the mass of the moon. This information can be used to create accurate tide tables for predicting high and low water levels, which is crucial for navigation and coastal management.
