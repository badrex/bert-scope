tldr: The authors conducted experiments to provide direct evidence for the downward atmospheric reflection of electric rays. They found that signal intensity variations, known as "fading," are caused by interference between direct and reflected rays from the upper atmosphere. This phenomenon is more pronounced at night and can be explained by the Heaviside layer's behavior.
