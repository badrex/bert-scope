tldr: The article discusses a structure/function analysis of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase, a key enzyme in gene expression regulation. The authors review genetic and biochemical data that reveal the structural details of RNA polymerase and how they encode function. They also explore the implications of these findings on the quaternary structure of RNA polymerase and its role in gene regulation in more complex systems.
