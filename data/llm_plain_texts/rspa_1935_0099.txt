tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the nuclear transformations of beryllium and boron by bombarding them with protons and heavy hydrogen ions. They discovered two distinct groups of particles emitted during the transformations, which they identified as hydrogen nuclei (H2) and helium-4 (He4) particles. The findings challenged the mass-data at the time and led to a reevaluation of the mass of He4, providing a better understanding of the light elements' masses.
