tldr: 'This study investigates the influence of temperature, reactant mixture composition, and reaction vessel size and shape on the ignition limits and reaction rates of hydrocarbon oxidation. The results show that thermal factors are not significant in large vessels, and an isothermal olefin mechanism can explain the observed experimental relations. The research also explores the induction period, maximum rate of non-isothermal pressure rise, and temperature rise accompanying ignition.'
