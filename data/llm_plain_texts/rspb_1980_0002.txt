tldr: 'The authors, Sir Cyril Clarke and E. B. Ford, reassess the intersexuality in the moth Lymantria dispar, focusing on the work of R. Goldschmidt. They find discrepancies between Goldschmidt's results and their own, and discuss the potential for testing the accuracy of the Goldschmidt hypothesis using the heterochromatin body in the larva as a marker for chromosomal sex in the adult.'
