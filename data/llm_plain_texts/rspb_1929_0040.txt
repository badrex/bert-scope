tldr: The study investigates the effects of anterior pituitary preparations on female rats experiencing anoestrus due to vitamin B deficiency and inanition. The results show that the pituitary preparations can stimulate oestrin production and follicular maturation in atrophied ovaries, leading to the resumption of normal reproductive functions. This suggests that both vitamin B deficiency and lowered calorific intake contribute to ovarian atrophy and anoestrus.
