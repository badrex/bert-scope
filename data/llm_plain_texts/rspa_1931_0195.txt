tldr: The authors studied the normal vibrations of carbonate and nitrate ions using Raman spectroscopy and infra-red data. They found that certain modes of vibration appear only in the infra-red spectrum, while others appear only in the Raman spectrum. By analyzing the vibrations, they were able to determine the structure of these ions and their properties.
