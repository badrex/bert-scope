tldr: This study investigates the ability of locusts to differentiate between sound pitches using their auditory organs. The research demonstrates that locusts can distinguish between different pitches at the level of the tympanic nerve and the metathoracic ganglion, suggesting that the central nervous system receives information about pitch from the hearing organ. The findings contribute to the understanding of insect hearing and auditory processing.
