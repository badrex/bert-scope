tldr: The author examines the growth and morphology of the gonads in mice, focusing on the development of follicles and the relationship between follicle size and oocyte growth. The study reveals that the majority of follicle growth occurs after the oocyte reaches its maximum size, and that the growth of the oocyte is directly related to follicle size until a certain point. After this point, the oocyte growth becomes independent of the follicle, and the follicle continues to grow without significant oocyte growth.
