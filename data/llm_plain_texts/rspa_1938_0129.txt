tldr: The authors describe a new method for exploring the atmosphere using radio-sounding balloons equipped with meteorological instruments. The instruments, which include a barometer and thermometer, control the modulation frequency of the radio transmitter, allowing for continuous recording of pressure and temperature during the balloon's ascent. This method provides a more accurate and efficient way to gather aerological data compared to previous techniques.
