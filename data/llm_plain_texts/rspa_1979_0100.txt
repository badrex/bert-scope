tldr: This paper studies the asymptotic behavior of solutions to the zero rest mass scalar wave equation in the Schwarzschild space-time, including parts of future and past null infinity. The authors find that the behavior of scalar fields in Schwarzschild space-time is different from that in a flat space-time, and that the source term modifies the asymptotic behavior in an essential way. The paper also discusses the intrinsic properties of Schwarzschild space-time and the conformal structure.
