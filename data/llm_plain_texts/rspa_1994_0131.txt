tldr: This article presents a microstructurally sensitive model of fatigue crack growth that considers the effects of microstructure on the early stages of crack growth. The model incorporates variables such as grain size, precipitation, and dispersion hardening, strain hardening, and misorientation between grains. It aims to improve the understanding and prediction of short fatigue crack behavior and provide a basis for designing new crack-resistant materials.
