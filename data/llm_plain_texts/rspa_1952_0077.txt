tldr: This study investigates the cross-section and angular distribution of the deuterium-deuterium reaction using thin gas targets with bombarding energies between 15 and 50 keV. The results show a significant deviation from the simple Gamow theory of penetration through a Coulomb barrier, which can be explained by the contribution of waves with non-vanishing angular momentum. The findings provide insights into the role of spin-orbit coupling in the transitions.
