tldr: The article presents three medical cases: 1) a child born with the bowels hanging out of the belly, 2) a woman with a suppression of urine due to menstrual blood blocking the urethra, and 3) a young girl with a stricture in the middle of her stomach dividing it into two bags. The author, Claudius Amyand, shares his observations and treatments for these cases.
