tldr: This article discusses the author's observations of aneurysms and arterial divisions in the thigh, as well as his experiments on animals to study the effects of surgical interventions. The author describes a case where a patient's femoral artery was divided into two trunks, and he explores the implications of this finding for aneurysm treatment. He also shares the results of an experiment on a dog, where the femoral artery was ligatured, and the animal's recovery and mobility were monitored.
