tldr: This article presents experiments on the adsorption of non-polar gases, such as argon, oxygen, and nitrogen, on alkali halide crystals like potassium chloride (KCl). The authors discuss the theoretical developments in applying quantum statistics to adsorption problems and evaluate the heats of adsorption for these gases on KCl. The results provide valuable data for further theoretical advancements in the field of surface chemistry.
