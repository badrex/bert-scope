tldr: This article discusses the possible interactions of muons at high energies, focusing on weak interactions. The author speculates on various scenarios for the muon's interactions, including electromagnetic coupling, coupling to a neutral particle, and coupling to and. The author also discusses the potential for discovering new particles and the development of lepton accelerators to study these interactions further.
