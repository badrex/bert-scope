tldr: The authors discovered that adding boiled and filtered yeast-juice to glucose fermentation by yeast-juice significantly increases the alcoholic fermentation. They found that the active component in the boiled and filtered yeast-juice is not destroyed by heat and can be separated by dialysis. This discovery led to the understanding that yeast-juice contains two fractions: an inactive residue and a dialysate that can activate the residue.
