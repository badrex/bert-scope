  - Dirac Equation
  - Green Function
  - Perturbation Theory
tldr: The authors present an expansion of the propagator of a relativistic electron in a static central potential using angular momentum. This expansion is useful in describing the behavior of the electron in intermediate states of physical processes and has applications in problems concerning heavy atoms.
