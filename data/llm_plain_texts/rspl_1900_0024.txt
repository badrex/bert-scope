tldr: This article describes an experimental investigation into the flow of marble under pressure. The researchers subjected marble columns to various pressures and observed the deformation and changes in the marble's properties. The results showed that the marble's strength decreased after deformation, and the rate of deformation affected the resulting rock's strength. The study provides insights into the processes that cause rock deformation in Earth's crust.
