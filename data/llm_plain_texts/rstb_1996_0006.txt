tldr: The author conducted a comprehensive character analysis of 95 species of Sacoglossa (Mollusca, Gastropoda, Opisthobranchia) to determine their phylogenetic relationships. The study found that the shelled Sacoglossa is a monophyletic group, while the non-shelled Sacoglossa is also a monophyletic group. The author proposed a classificatory framework based on shared derived characters and discussed various classification issues within the Sacoglossa.
