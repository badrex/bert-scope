tldr: The authors studied the thermal decomposition of gaseous benzaldehyde and found that the predominant reaction is a homogeneous decomposition. They discovered that the uninhibited reaction is nearly of the first order with respect to benzaldehyde concentration, while the inhibited reaction has a different order, varying between one and two. The results indicate that the thermal decomposition of benzaldehyde occurs through a chain reaction mechanism, which is different from the mechanism of acetaldehyde decomposition.
