tldr: This article discusses the increasing demand for energy and the need to explore non-conventional hydrocarbon sources, such as oil shale, tar sands, and liquefied and gasified coal, due to the decreasing supply of conventional hydrocarbons. The author emphasizes the importance of developing synthetic fuels in North America to reduce pressure on world oil supplies and meet the energy needs of Western nations. The article also highlights the potential of tar sands, oil shale, and coal as resources for synthetic fuel production and the challenges and technologies involved in their extraction and processing.
