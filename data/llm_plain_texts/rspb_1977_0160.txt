tldr: The article investigates the ultrastructure and function of gravity-perceiving cells in plant roots, specifically the root cap's statocytes. The researchers discovered that the sedimentation of amyloplasts (statoliths) onto the distal endoplasmic reticulum (ER) complex plays a crucial role in graviperception. The stress exerted by the amyloplasts on the ER complex may influence the structural and functional state of the ER membranes, leading to a differential stress on the ER complexes that could be the basis of graviperception. The findings contribute to our understanding of how plants sense and respond to gravity.
