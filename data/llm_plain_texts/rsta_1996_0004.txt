tldr: The authors present a new global palaeomagnetic database of lava flows and intrusive bodies suitable for studying palaeosecular variation and the time-averaged geomagnetic field. They review existing palaeosecular variation models and suggest that current models are inadequate due to data distribution and quality. The need for revised models of the time-averaged field structure for both normal and reverse polarities is emphasized before reliable models for palaeosecular variation can be made.
