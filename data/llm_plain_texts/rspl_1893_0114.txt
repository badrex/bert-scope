revised_title: Effects of Mechanical Treatment and Impurities on Electrical Conductivity
semantic_tags:
  - Electrical Conductivity
  - Mechanical Treatment
  - Impurities in Metals
  - Specific Resistance
  - Liquefied Atmospheric Air
tldr: The author investigates the effects of mechanical treatment and impurities on the electrical conductivity of metals. They found that mechanical treatment does not affect the electrical properties of metals, while even a small impurity significantly reduces conductivity. The author also discusses the freezing of liquefied atmospheric air into a solid state, leaving further research to determine its composition.
