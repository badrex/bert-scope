tldr: The author discusses the organization of a memory system in the octopus, suggesting the existence of memory units and proposing that the octopus's nervous system is an anatomy for making inductive inferences. The study of memory in the octopus may provide insights into the physical nature of memory and its role in higher nervous functions, such as learning and decision-making.
