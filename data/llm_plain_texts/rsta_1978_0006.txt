tldr: This article discusses the micromechanisms of flow and fracture in the Earth's crust and mantle, focusing on the dominant mechanisms of deformation and their relevance to geophysical modeling. It outlines the effects of pressure, temperature, and time on the deformation of materials and provides a summary of the material properties for olivine, a key component of the Earth's upper mantle. The article also highlights the importance of understanding and modeling phenomena such as the flow of the Earth's mantle, ice body deformation, and salt dome formation.
