tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the attractive powers of mineral acids and their reactions with various metals. They found that the solubility and properties of metals in acids depend on their degree of dephlogistication. The author also discovered that different acids have varying affinities for water and phlogiston, which affects their reactions with metals.
