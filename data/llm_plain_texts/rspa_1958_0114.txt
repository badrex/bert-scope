semantic_tags:
  - Explosives
  - Shock initiation
  - Liquid break up
  - Detonation
  - Pressure measurement
tldr: This article discusses the initiation and growth of explosions in solids, focusing on the initiation of liquid explosives by shock and the importance of liquid breakup. The authors explore the factors that contribute to ignition and detonation, including the formation of foam, pressure changes, and the role of the surrounding air. They also examine the experimental methods used to study these phenomena.
