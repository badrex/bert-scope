tldr: The authors examine the rate of energy loss of high-energy cosmic ray muons by comparing observed depth-intensity relations with predictions from the known sea-level energy spectrum of cosmic ray muons. They assess the evidence for various parameters and estimate the sea-level muon spectrum up to 10,000 and the depth-intensity relation down to 7,000 m.w.e. The study concludes that there is no evidence for a significant anomaly in the energy loss processes for muons of energies up to 10,000.
