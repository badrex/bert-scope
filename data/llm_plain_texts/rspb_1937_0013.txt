tldr: The authors studied the nervous system of the cockroach and discovered the synaptic transmission of impulses in the last abdominal ganglion. They found that some fibers from the cercus directly pass through the ganglion, while others synapse with a smaller number of fibers that run forwards in the cord. These giant fibers have large action potentials and run through the next five abdominal ganglia. The study provides insights into the functioning of the invertebrate nervous system and sensory processing.
