tldr: This article investigates the occurrence and nature of twins in graphite crystals. The twins are regions misoriented from the crystal by a rotation of about a direction in the basal plane, and the twin boundaries are shown to be simple tilt boundaries of a particular angle. The dislocation structure of the twin boundary is deduced, and the effect of twins on the mechanical properties of graphite crystals is considered.
