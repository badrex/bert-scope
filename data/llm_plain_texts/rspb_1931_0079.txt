tldr: The authors conducted a study on the crustacean heart muscle, specifically in Maia, to understand its activities and functions. They found that sea-water, despite having a different osmotic pressure, can maintain the heart's beating condition. The study also showed the influence of pressure on the heart's rate and the importance of perfusion in maintaining regular beats.
