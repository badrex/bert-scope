tldr: This article analyzes the irreducible representations of the unitary unimodular group in three dimensions, focusing on the ranges of hypercharge and isobaric spin. The author determines the dimension formula, invariants, and identities relating the generators of the group, providing a systematic study of these representations and their properties.
