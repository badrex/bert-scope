tldr: This article discusses the acquisition and dissolution of language, focusing on disorders of semantic memory. It explores three main issues: category specificity, modality specificity, and the distinction between access and representation disorders. The authors present evidence for category-specific impairments in knowledge of living things and man-made objects, as well as finer-grain and broader dissociations. They also investigate the role of action names and verbs in semantic memory disorders.
