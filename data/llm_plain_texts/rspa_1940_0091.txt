tldr: This study investigates the quenching efficiency of various molecules in sodium's resonance radiation. The results show that unsaturated molecules have a higher quenching efficiency, while saturated hydrocarbons have a lower efficiency. The findings suggest that the energy discrepancy between molecules is not the main factor controlling quenching efficiency.
