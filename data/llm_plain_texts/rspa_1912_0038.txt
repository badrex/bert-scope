tldr: The authors investigated the X-ray radiation emitted by elements with high atomic weight, such as tungsten, gold, platinum, lead, bismuth, thorium, and uranium. They discovered two types of radiation: a hard characteristic radiation and a soft radiation. The authors also found that the intensity of scattered radiation increases with the atomic weight of the element, making it difficult to distinguish the homogeneous radiation from the scattered radiation. They developed a method to correct for the scattered radiation and studied the absorption properties of these elements.
