tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the distortion of brass and iron crystals to understand the mechanism of distortion in crystals with a body-centered cubic lattice. They found that the slip-plane in brass tended to be closer to a {110} plane, while in iron, the slip-planes were of type {123}. The study provided insights into the effect of lattice structure on the distortion of crystals and the role of slip-planes in the deformation process.
