tldr: The authors measured the charge spectrum produced by the isomeric decay of 131Xe and used a theoretical estimate to calculate the internal conversion coefficient of the 163-ray in the outermost electron shell. They found that the majority of the conversion events occurred in the outermost shell, with a calculated internal conversion coefficient of 0.29.
