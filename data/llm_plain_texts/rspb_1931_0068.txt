tldr: The authors studied the therapeutic effects of styryl quinoline derivatives on trypanocidal action. They discovered that certain isomerides of these compounds can interfere with the therapeutic effects of their active counterparts. This highlights the importance of careful synthesis and analysis when developing chemotherapeutic agents.
