tldr: The authors investigate the effects of a rotating central body on planetary orbits using Whitehead's theory of gravitation. They calculate the advance of perihelion of a planetary orbit in the equatorial plane of a rotating sphere and find that the results agree closely with those obtained using Einstein's linearized law of gravitation. The study also shows that Whitehead's law of gravitation gives the same first-order perturbations of Newtonian orbits as Lense and Thirring's results for Einstein's theory.
