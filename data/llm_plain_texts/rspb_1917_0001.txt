  - Heat production
  - Body weight
  - Movement cost
tldr: This study investigates the efficiency of human work and the cost of associated movements. The authors found that efficiency is directly related to body weight, with heavier individuals having a higher efficiency in work performance. The study also highlights the importance of considering individual factors, such as clothing and body type, when examining efficiency in work and movement.
