tldr: The authors present a new method to solve the conformal transformation problem using an electrical tank. They demonstrate the accuracy of this method by applying it to the torsion problem in a twisted prism with an equilateral triangle cross-section. This method offers a practical and theoretical approach to solving potential and hydrodynamic problems.
