tldr: This article discusses the atomic scattering factor for X-rays and its behavior in the region of anomalous dispersion. The authors explain the influence of anomalous dispersion on the scattering factor and its implications for understanding the interaction of X-rays with atoms. They also explore the connection between anomalous dispersion and quantum mechanics in chemical reactions.
