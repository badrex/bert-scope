tldr: The authors analyzed energetic particle measurements from Ariel I satellite after the Starfish nuclear explosion. They discovered that the explosion created a shell of electrons around Earth, fed by fission fragments near Johnston Island. The study also found that the explosion disrupted some outer belt electrons into the atmosphere and led to a softer spectrum of additional electrons at high L values.
