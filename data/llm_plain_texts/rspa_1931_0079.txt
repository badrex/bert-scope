tldr: The author investigates the effect of chemical combination on X-ray absorption edges and emission lines in various sulphur compounds. They observe changes in the relative intensities and sharpness of the X-ray lines, indicating that the surrounding atoms cause a redistribution of electrons and energy within the atom. The study also highlights the suppression of certain X-ray lines in some sulphur compounds, such as silicon oxide and caesium sulphate.
