tldr: The author argues that detectable polymorphism in host resistance and parasite host range is a poor guide to the true specificity of a host-parasite interaction. They propose the matching-allele model, which is based on the currently favored elicitor-receptor model for the biochemistry of plant-pathogen recognition, as an alternative to the gene-for-gene model. The matching-allele model can lead to inferred patterns of resistance and virulence that appear similar to the gene-for-gene specificity, making it difficult to reconstruct both specificity and population history from patterns of resistance among host-parasite pairs in a sample.
