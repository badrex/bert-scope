tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the effectiveness of atoxyl, vaccines, cold, X-rays, and leucocytic extract in treating animals infected with trypanosomes. They found that small doses of atoxyl prolonged the life of the host and stimulated division of the parasites, while large doses cleared the parasites from the peripheral blood temporarily. Vaccines showed mixed results, and the authors concluded that atoxyl is not a specific treatment for trypanosomiasis and may be toxic to the body cells.
