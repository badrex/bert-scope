tldr: This article explores leaf energy balances and their applications in understanding the effects of temperature on plant organs and microhabitats in forests. The authors develop models to predict leaf temperatures during clear nights and examine the influence of factors such as soil thermal conductivity, leaf size, orientation, and height. They also investigate the potential bias in whole-tree transpiration rates measured with large ventilated chambers and propose methods to estimate transpiration rates more accurately.
