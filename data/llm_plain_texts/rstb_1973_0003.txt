tldr: This article discusses the history and recent developments in vertebrate smooth muscle physiology. It outlines the classification of smooth muscles into two groups, one resembling cardiac muscle and the other skeletal muscle. The author also presents two experiments demonstrating the effects of stretching and contraction on smooth muscle, suggesting potential implications for controlling vascular tone and regulating air passage width in muscles subject to periodic changes in length.
