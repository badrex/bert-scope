tldr: The study examines the sperm efficiency in marsupials, particularly in the Virginia opossum, Didelphis virginiana. It reveals that despite a low number of spermatozoa stored in the epididymis, these marsupials have a high efficiency in terms of spermatozoa ascending to and surviving in the oviduct. The effectiveness may be due to two unique features: head-pairing phenomenon and spermatozoa storage crypts in the oviduct's isthmus. This finding suggests that where mechanisms protect the sperm in the female tract, a lower sperm production level can be maintained without compromising fertility.
