tldr: The article examines the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs group in the context of nuclear topology, focusing on the problem of finding irreducible representations. It explores the connection between the topology and the possible spins of elementary particles, suggesting that the extra representations in the nuclear topology may describe'scattering' states, while the remaining ones may correspond to bound states of elementary particles.
