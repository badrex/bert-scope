tldr: The authors conducted experiments to analyze the spectrum of radium emanation, discovering numerous green, blue, and violet lines, as well as a slightly refrangible line in the red. They also found that the emanation's spectrum fades and is replaced by the spectrum of secondary hydrogen. The authors used different types of electrodes to study the absorption of emanation and observed new lines belonging to the emanation spectrum.
