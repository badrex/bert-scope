tldr: The authors discovered three types of abnormalities in the pituitary glands of frogs: proliferation of cells in the pars nervosa, formation of non-ciliated vesicles, and formation of ciliated vesicles. These abnormalities were analyzed through histological and anatomical examinations, providing insights into the structure and function of the frog's pituitary gland.
