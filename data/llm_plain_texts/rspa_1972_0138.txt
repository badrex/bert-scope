tldr: This article presents a study on the ground states of molecules, specifically ethane, using the Mindo (2) potential surface. The authors calculate force constants and molecular vibrations, comparing their results with experimental data. The study supports the use of the INDO (2) method in calculating potential surfaces and reaction paths for chemical reactions.
