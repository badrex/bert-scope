tldr: This article investigates the kinetics and mechanism of styrene polymerization sensitized by molecules in the triplet state. The authors confirm that the triplet state of anthracene is responsible for the sensitization and find that both triplet and unexcited singlet anthracene copolymerize with styrene. The study also extends to the polymerizations sensitized by pyrene and chrysene, and the unsensitized photopolymerization of styrene. The results support the initiation mechanism involving the initial formation of a triplet-monomer complex.
