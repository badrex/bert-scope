tldr: This article presents a corrective note by De La Rue, Stewart, and Loewy to their previous paper on solar physics research. They correct the erroneous date given for one of Professor Wolf's maxima and discuss the effects of this correction on their findings. Additionally, the authors describe their experiments on the action between copper and nitrate of silver in solution, observing the deposition of a thin layer of metallic copper on silver crystals under specific conditions.
