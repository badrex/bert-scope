tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the scattering of alpha particles in helium using the annular ring method. The results showed that the amount of scattering was twice that expected on classical theory, as predicted by Mott's calculations based on quantum mechanics. This provided evidence for the failure of classical theory in explaining particle scattering and the importance of quantum mechanics in understanding atomic interactions.
