tldr: The authors analyzed human bone samples for strontium-90 concentrations to understand its entry into the human body and bone turnover. They found that the highest strontium-90 levels were in children aged 1 to 2 years, while adult levels increased progressively. The study also showed that the first year of life has nearly complete bone turnover, while adolescents experience new bone accretion, and adults have varying rates of bone replacement depending on bone type.
