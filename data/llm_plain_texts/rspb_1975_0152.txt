tldr: 'The study investigates the uptake of lead by human volunteers who inhaled motor exhaust. The exhaust lead was tagged with a radioactive marker to distinguish the deposition in the lung, uptake to blood, and excretion of the inhaled dose. The results showed that the percentage deposition in the lung depended on the length of the respiratory cycle, and about half of the amount deposited in the lung was in the blood at 60 minutes after inhalation. The findings can be used to predict the average contribution of exhaust lead to blood lead levels after continuous exposure.'
