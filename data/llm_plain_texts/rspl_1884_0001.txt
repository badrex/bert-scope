tldr: The author's study on the cortical connections of the optic nerves reveals that the optic tract is directly connected to various parts of the cerebral hemisphere. The research also discusses the origins of the optic nerves, the role of Meynert's commissure, and the evolution of the brain's optic centers. The findings suggest that cortical fibers play a role in connecting motor and other centers of the cortex in response to visual stimuli.
