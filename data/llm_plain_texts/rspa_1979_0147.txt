tldr: This article investigates the nonlinear stability of boundary layers in fluid dynamics, focusing on disturbances of various sizes. The study considers the largest size of disturbance that can be dealt with, near the lower branch of the neutral curve, and explores the implications of decreasing the disturbance size. The findings have implications for understanding the behavior of boundary layers in various flow situations.
