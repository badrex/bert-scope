semantic_tags:

  - Corona
tldr: This article discusses observations of the quiet Sun in the extreme ultraviolet region, focusing on the chromosphere, transition region, and corona. The authors examine the structure of the network, the distribution of intensities in cell interiors and network elements, and the effects of periodic oscillations and non-periodic brightenings. They also discuss the center-to-limb behavior of transition region and coronal lines, and the construction of coronal models based on these observations.
