tldr: This article discusses experiments conducted to determine the limit of high flying when breathing oxygen. The experiments involved animals and humans in pressurized chambers, and the results showed that about 85 mm Hg is the pressure at which severe symptoms occur for various animals. The study also confirmed previous findings on human tolerance to oxygen at high altitudes and led to the development of special oxygen-breathing apparatus for pilots, doubling the possible height of flying.
