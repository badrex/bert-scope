tldr: The study investigates the electroreceptive capabilities of the platypus and its role in feeding behavior. The platypus is sensitive to electrical waveforms that mimic the electromyogenic potentials of fleeing prey, and it responds with a directionally tuned reflex. The research also discusses the integration of electro-sensory capacities into foraging strategies and platypus husbandry.
