tldr: The author conducted an experiment comparing the reproductive output of isolated, self-fertilizing snails with paired, predominantly cross-fertilizing snails from two laboratory populations of Biomphalaria glabrata. The results showed that isolated snails had reduced reproductive output compared to paired snails, suggesting that an absence of social facilitation, rather than inbreeding depression, may play a role in reducing reproductive output of isolated snails.
