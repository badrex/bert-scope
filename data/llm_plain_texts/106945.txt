tldr: In 1795, Sir William Hamilton observed the eruption of Mount Vesuvius and its effects on the surrounding area. He described the lava flow, the thickness of the lava, and the impact on the town of Naples. The author also mentioned the petroleum floating on the sea surface and the ash fall in Naples. The eruption caused significant damage to the town, and a body of soldiers was sent to help the victims. The author also discussed the geological aspects of the eruption, such as the height of the ash clouds and the crater of Vesuvius.
