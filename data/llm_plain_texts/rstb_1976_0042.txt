tldr: The authors studied the anatomy of three types of neurosecretory neurons (Dark Green Cells, Yellow Cells, and Yellow-green Cells) in the central nervous system of the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis. They used the Alcian Blue-Alcian Yellow stain to analyze the cells' axonal morphology and traced their projections to neurohaemal areas. The results showed that these cells play a role in ion and water exchange and may be involved in kidney function. The study provides evidence that these cells release their secretory products into the bloodstream.
