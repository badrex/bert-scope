tldr: This article investigates the volumetric relations of ozone and the effects of electrical discharge on oxygen and other gases. The authors discovered that when oxygen turns into ozone, a significant condensation occurs, making it almost incompatible for ozone to exist as an allotropic form of oxygen in the gaseous state. The authors also found differences in the action between spark and glow discharges on various gases.
