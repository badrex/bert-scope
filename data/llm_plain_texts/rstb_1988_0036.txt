tldr: The article discusses the process of protein import into mitochondria, focusing on the unfolding of proteins as they pass through the mitochondrial membranes. The authors found that ATP and GTP are required for this process, and that the extent of unfolding may be crucial for successful import. They also discovered that the mitochondrial "import machinery" may play a role in unfolding proteins before they cross the mitochondrial membranes.
