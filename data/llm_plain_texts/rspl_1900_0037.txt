tldr: The authors discovered three new gases, argon, krypton, and xenon, in the atmosphere. They studied their physical properties, such as refractivity, density, and compressibility, and found that they are monatomic gases. These gases form a series in the periodic table between fluorine and sodium, and their spectra show distinct colors. The researchers also attempted to separate helium from neon using liquid hydrogen but were unsuccessful in obtaining pure helium.
