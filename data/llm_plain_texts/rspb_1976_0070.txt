tldr: The authors discovered a calcium-dependent electrical response in twitch muscle fibers of the frog when using chloride-free saline with tetraethylammonium sulfate. This response involved an initial depolarization followed by a delayed spike, which was abolished by removing external calcium or adding cobalt or D-600. The study suggests that calcium entry might be associated with a step between membrane depolarization and muscle contraction.
