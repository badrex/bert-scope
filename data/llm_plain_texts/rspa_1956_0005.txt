tldr: The authors conducted experiments on silver-palladium and silver-cadmium alloys to study their thermal and electrical conductivity at low temperatures. They found that the alloys' thermal conductivity has both electronic and lattice components, and the electrical resistance increases with palladium content. The results provide insights into the scattering of lattice waves by electrons and the interaction between phonons and conduction electrons.
