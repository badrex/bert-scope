tldr: The article describes the unique echinoderm Astrophiura, which exhibits characteristics of both Asteroidea and Ophiuroidea. This organism is considered an intermediate form that helps bridge the differences between the two orders. Further research is needed to understand its exact position in the evolutionary tree, but Astrophiura's unique features make it an important subject for study in the field of zoology.
