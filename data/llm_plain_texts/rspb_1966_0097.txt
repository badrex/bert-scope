tldr: The authors investigated the relationship between the structure of conifer wood cell walls and the initial Young modulus, a measure of elasticity. They found that the Young's modulus increases from the pith to the bark in Sitka spruce wood. The authors developed two mathematical models to explain the relationship between the microfibrillar angle and the Young's modulus, providing insights into the mechanical properties of wood. This research contributes to understanding the structure-property relationship in plant materials.
