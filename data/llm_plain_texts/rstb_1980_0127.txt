tldr: The authors study the functional and adaptive morphology of deep-sea species of the Arcacea (Mollusca: Bivalvia) from the Atlantic. They describe the progression in form from an epibyssate nestling habit to an infaunal endobyssate habit in these species. They also discuss the morphological changes related to the environment and the lack of glands in mantle tissue, reduced palps, and the absence of sorting areas in the stomach, which are adaptations to the small quantity of suspended food present in the deep sea.
