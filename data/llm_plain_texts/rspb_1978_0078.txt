tldr: The authors analyzed the pigment composition of the organism Cyanophora paradoxa and its endosymbiotic cyanelles. They found that the photosynthetic pigments include P-carotene, chlorophyll a, zeaxanthin, and two bilichromoproteins, allo-phycocyanin (AP) and c-phycocyanin (CP). The study provides insights into the localization and biochemical properties of these pigments within the cyanelles and their molecular structure.
