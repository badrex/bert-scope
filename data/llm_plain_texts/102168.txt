tldr: The author conducted a series of experiments to study the process of generation in dogs. They discovered that sperm can survive in the female reproductive system for several days and that conception may not always occur immediately after mating. The author also found that the uterus is the primary site for sperm and fertilization, contradicting the widely held belief that eggs are sucked from the ovaries. The author's findings challenge the prevailing theories of the time and provide valuable insights into the reproductive process.
