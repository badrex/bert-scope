  - Metal dissolution
  - Dielectric properties
  - Interface phenomena
tldr: The article explores the irreversible interactions between metals and electrolytes, focusing on the kinetics of metal dissolution and the formation of double layers. It demonstrates that when a metal is dipped into an electrolyte, a double layer is established, and the initial rate of dissolution is calculated. The article also discusses how dielectric properties of the electrolyte affect the dissolution process and how the strength of the double layer and its formation time are estimated.
