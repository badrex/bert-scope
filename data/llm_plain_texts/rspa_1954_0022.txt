tldr: The authors observed and analyzed the decay of heavy mesons in photographic emulsions, identifying the charged secondary particles and determining their mass and energy. They found that the secondary particles could be either -mesons or -mesons, and discussed the importance of further evaluating the scattering parameter for more accurate results. This research contributed to the understanding of particle physics and nuclear interactions.
