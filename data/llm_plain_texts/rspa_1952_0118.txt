tldr: This article explains how the characteristic slip directions and planes in metal crystals can be predicted by considering the dependence of the energy of a dislocation on its plane. The energy of a dislocation is treated as a function of a parameter, which is defined as the ratio of the Burgers vector to the interplanar spacing. The observed slip systems correspond to the lowest possible values of this parameter in all crystal types studied. The reason for the existence of alternative slip systems, particularly at high temperatures, is also discussed in terms of this concept.
