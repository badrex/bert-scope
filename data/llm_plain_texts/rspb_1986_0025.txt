tldr: The authors propose a model for the deposition of eggshells in crocodilian, testudinian, and avian species based on crystal growth considerations. They find that crystal growth is initiated at a single location and fans out in all directions. The degree of texture development in the eggshells is influenced by the column radius and the degree of physical hindrance presented by the organic network. The organic component does not control crystal growth but acts as a reinforcing fibrous network.
