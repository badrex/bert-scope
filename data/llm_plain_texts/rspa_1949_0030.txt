revised_title: Nuclear Explosions and Cosmic Ray Interactions
semantic_tags:
  - Nuclear physics
  - Cosmic rays
  - Particle tracks
  - Nuclear fission
  - Nuclear fragmentation
tldr: The author discusses nuclear explosions and the discovery of stars, groups of tracks resembling those in a Wilson chamber, on photographic plates. These stars are caused by cosmic rays and represent fragments from the exploding nucleus of an atom in the emulsion. The author examines the nature and origin of these stars, their relation to analogous phenomena observed in the Wilson chamber, and the energy associated with charged particles from these stars.
