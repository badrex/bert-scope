tldr: The Royal Society's Committee clarifies the role and function of the Philosophical Transactions, explaining that the Society does not endorse or approve the content of the published papers, but rather selects and publishes papers of importance and singularity. They emphasize that the Society does not give opinions on subjects and that thanks given to authors or exhibitors are a matter of civility rather than endorsement.
