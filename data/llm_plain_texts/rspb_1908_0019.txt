tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of temperature on phagocytosis. They found that the degree of phagocytosis increases with rising temperature, but the rate of combination of serum with the coccus is slower at lower temperatures. The study also showed that serum loses more opsonin at 37°C than at 0°C, which affects the phagocytic intake.
