tldr: This article investigates the oblique propagation of electromagnetic waves in a non-isotropic medium, specifically the ionosphere. The authors develop a mathematical framework to understand the behavior of these waves and their polarizations in such a medium. They find that the direction of energy propagation often differs from the direction of phase propagation due to the presence of a component of electric field along the direction of phase propagation. The authors also discuss the special case of a non-absorbing medium and the implications of their findings for understanding wave propagation in the ionosphere.
