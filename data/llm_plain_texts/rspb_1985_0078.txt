tldr: The article discusses the role of oncogenes in normal and malignant growth, focusing on the nuclear location signal. The authors identify a short sequence of amino acids responsible for the normal nuclear location of proteins, such as SV40 Large T. They also report a computer search for similar sequences in other proteins, suggesting that this sequence acts as a nuclear location signal in other nuclear proteins but may not function in all cases.
