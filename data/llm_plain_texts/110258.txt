tldr: The author conducted experiments to create an artificial water cement for building purposes. They found that carbonate of lime, silica, and alumina are essential ingredients, and adding small proportions of iron oxide, lead oxide, or manganese oxide can improve the cement's qualities. The author recommends applying the cement in one coat for better adhesion and has used the artificial cement in various buildings exposed to weather for testing.
