semantic_tags:
  - Muscle metabolism
  - Glandular activity
  - Oxygen consumption
  - Blood flow
  - Hemoglobin concentration
tldr: This study investigates the effects of functional activity in striated muscle and the submaxillary gland. The authors analyze oxygen consumption, exudation from blood vessels, and hemoglobin concentration in both muscle and glandular tissues during prolonged periods of exercise. The results provide insights into the metabolic changes and secondary effects in blood vessels and lymph flow, comparing the responses of muscle and glandular tissues to exercise.
