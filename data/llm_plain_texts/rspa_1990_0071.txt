tldr: This article studies minimizers and gradient flows for singularly perturbed bi-stable potentials with a Dirichlet condition. The authors identify a limiting variational problem, the so-called -limit, and construct a formal asymptotic solution for the gradient flow. They show that fronts rapidly develop and then propagate with normal velocity, where is mean curvature. The Dirichlet condition is shown to imply a contact angle condition for the front, which represents the asymptotically correct evolution process for the -limit.
