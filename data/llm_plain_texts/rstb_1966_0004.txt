tldr: This study investigates the role of the pituitary gland and kidneys in the rise of aldosterone secretion following haemorrhage. The experiments show that both ACTH and angiotensin can replace each other and are essential for the adrenal response to haemorrhage. The results suggest that these two agents can fully replace each other, and neither nephrectomy nor hypophysectomy alone diminishes the effect of haemorrhage on aldosterone secretion.
