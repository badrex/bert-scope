tldr: The authors conducted experiments on rats to study the factors influencing the functional development of the male gonad. They investigated the effects of various hormonal factors, such as anterior pituitary lobe, gonadotropic preparations from pregnancy urine, and other substances like suprarenal tissue and muscle. The results showed that implantation of anterior pituitary lobe caused an increase in the weight of the suprarenal glands and inhibited the growth of the testes. Histological examination revealed that the treatment led to a definite effect, namely, the inhibition of spermatogenesis. The study aimed to differentiate changes dependent upon known hormonal factors from any non-specific effects resulting from impurities in hormonal preparations.
