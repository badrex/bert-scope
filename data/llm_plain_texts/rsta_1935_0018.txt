tldr: This article investigates the effects of water-soluble colloids, such as dextrine and gum-arabic, on the growth and constitution of crystals of lead salts. The presence of these colloids can modify the crystal habit and alter the stability of various physical forms. The absorption of colloid from solution during crystallization or by crystals already formed is also examined. The study provides insights into the complex interactions between colloids and lead salt crystals, which can have implications for the development of new materials and understanding of crystal growth processes.
