tldr: The article describes a green, helical-shaped organism that moves by growing at the anterior end and shrinking at the posterior end. The organism's movement is unique and has not been observed in other spiral-shaped organisms. The author discusses the organism's structure, movement, and possible systematic position, suggesting a relationship with Spirochaetoidea and Cyanophyceae.
