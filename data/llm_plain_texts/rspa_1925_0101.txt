tldr: The authors discuss the application of X-ray methods to study the crystal structures of alloys and solid solutions. They describe the process of using powder-photographs and ionization spectrometers to analyze the structures and dimensions of cells in these materials. The research aims to determine the limits of mutual solubility of metals and improve our understanding of alloy properties.
