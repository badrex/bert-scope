tldr: The author conducted experiments on the effect of pressure on combustion phenomena and the luminous agents in gas flames. They found that the diminution in illuminating-power is directly proportional to the diminution in atmospheric pressure. This led them to doubt the commonly accepted theory that the light of a gas-flame and luminous flames in general is due to the presence of phosphorus or other similar substances.
