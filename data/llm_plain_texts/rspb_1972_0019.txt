tldr: The authors investigated the ultrastructure of collagen in rat tail tendons and its relation to mechanical properties as a function of ageing. They found that the crimp angle decreases and the periodicity increases with age, implying a constant crimp number during the animal's lifetime. The stress-strain properties of tendons were measured, and a model with inflexible hinges provided a reasonable fit with the experimental data. The study's findings have implications for understanding the structure and properties of tendons in relation to ageing.
