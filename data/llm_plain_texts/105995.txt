tldr: The author, Mathew Dobson, describes a petrified stratum formed by the waters of Matlock in Derbyshire. The stratum is composed of various materials such as moss, nuts, leaves, acorns, pieces of wood, and even tree trunks. The hardness of the stratum varies, with some parts becoming as hard as flint upon exposure to the air. The stratum has been used for building houses due to its durability. The author also discusses the possible age of the stratum and the exhaustion of the mineral sources responsible for its formation.
