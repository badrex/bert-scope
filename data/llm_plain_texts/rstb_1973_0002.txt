tldr: This study examines the ultrastructural changes in axons of the rat superior cervical ganglion following constriction or section of postganglionic branches. The research focuses on the accumulation of organelles and the process of intracellular digestion in response to axonal injury. The findings provide insights into the coordinated response of neurons to axonal injury and the role of axonal and cell body reactions in neuronal regeneration.
