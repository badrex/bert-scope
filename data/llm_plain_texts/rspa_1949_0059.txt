tldr: The authors derive the equations of film lubrication from the general equations of hydrodynamics, assuming steady motion between two close and nearly parallel surfaces. They discuss the conditions for film lubrication, considering both geometric and thermal wedges, and analyze the effects of viscosity variation and temperature on the performance of these types of lubrication. The study provides a modern treatment of the lubrication equations and offers insights into the design and performance of bearings and other lubricated systems.
