tldr: The authors studied the effect of nerve stimulation on the noradrenaline content of the cat's spleen. They developed a method to measure changes in the spleen's noradrenaline content and transmitter overflow into the venous blood. The results showed that nerve stimulation led to an underlying mean depletion of 8% in noradrenaline content and a corresponding amount of transmitter overflowed into the venous blood. The study indicates that uptake was proportional to liberation, with approximately 70% of the liberated transmitter being reabsorbed in the spleen in an extractable form.
