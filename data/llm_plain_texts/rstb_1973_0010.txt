tldr: This article discusses the factors controlling myogenic activity in smooth muscle, focusing on the roles of sodium and calcium ions. The author explains how sodium ions influence the membrane potential and contribute to calcium regulation, while calcium plays a primary role in generating spontaneous activity. The study presents results from experiments on guinea-pig tissues, providing insights into the underlying components of electrical activity in smooth muscles.
