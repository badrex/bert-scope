tldr: The authors present a simplified proof of Wigner's time-reversal theorems and demonstrate how the formalism required can be derived directly from the Dirac equation for an electron in a crystal field. They show that the structure of the space-group operations that commute with the Dirac Hamiltonian is determined by the point-group of the crystal field. The authors also discuss the three cases of time-reversal symmetry in the context of the Dirac equation and provide a more straightforward proof of Wigner's theorems.
