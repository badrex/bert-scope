tldr: The author discovered a new parasitic nematode species, Tylenchinema oscinellae, that attacks the frit-fly (Oscinella frit) and damages oat plants. The nematodes are found in the frit-fly larvae and can also be found in the plant tissues surrounding the fly larvae. The life cycle of the nematode involves multiple stages within the host and can be passed through different generations of the frit-fly.
