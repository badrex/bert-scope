tldr: The article investigates the effects of heteroatom size and reactivity on low-energy ion implantation in diamond using X-ray induced electron spectroscopy and oxidative depth profiling. The study found that rare gases and nitrogen were implanted into the diamond surfaces, with nitrogen reaching up to 50 at.% concentration. The results showed that helium, nitrogen, xenon, and neon penetrated deeper into the diamond than argon and krypton, causing more disorder. The research also revealed the formation of submicroscopic gas bubbles near the surface and the potential for krypton and xenon to aggregate in subsurface microcavities.
