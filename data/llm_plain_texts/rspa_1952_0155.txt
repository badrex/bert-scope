tldr: The authors develop an energy equation for fluid-film lubrication to resolve the discrepancy between two different energy equations used in the literature. They discuss the importance of considering the flow work done on the lubricant and its impact on temperature distribution in the film. The study has implications for the analysis of Reynolds equation, including thermal and compressional effects.
