revised_title: Oscillations of an Exothermic Reaction in a Closed System: Approximate Representation of Arrhenius Temperature-Dependence
semantic_tags:
  - Chemical kinetics
  - Nonlinear dynamics
  - Exothermic reactions
  - Temperature dependence
  - Pool chemical approximation
tldr: This article studies oscillatory behavior in exothermic reactions within a closed system, focusing on the temperature dependence of the reaction rate. The authors develop an approximate representation of the Arrhenius law and analyze the 'pool chemical' approximation, which simplifies the model while still providing useful insights into the system's behavior.
