tldr: The authors conducted infrared measurements of stratospheric composition to study the daytime changes of nitrogen oxides (NO and NO2). They used a balloon-borne pressure modulator radiometer to measure altitude profiles of NO and NO2 from mid-morning till sunset. The results showed that the column of NO above 24 km increased, while the NO2 column above 30 km reached a maximum soon after noon and fell by sunset. The study also compared the measured concentrations with predictions from a diurnal model, showing close agreement in daytime changes.
