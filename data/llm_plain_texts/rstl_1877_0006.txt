tldr: The authors, H. E. Roscoe and T. E. Thorpe, conducted experiments to compare the absorption spectra of bromine and iodine monochloride. They found that while some bands were nearly identical, the overall spectra were not the same. The study helped to determine the differences in the molecular vibrations of the two gases.
