tldr: The authors studied the fitness of three genotypes of Drosophila melanogaster in 50 different environments to estimate the genomic mutation rate. They found that both MA lines, which had accumulated mutations without natural selection, had lower fitness than the Selected line, especially in harsh conditions. This suggests that previous experiments may have underestimated the genomic deleterious mutation rate in Drosophila melanogaster.
