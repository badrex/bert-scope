tldr: The authors develop a probability-based model to explain the enormous diversity of the lymphocyte repertoire in the immune system. They find that the major factor in this relation between diversity and the number of self antigens, suggesting that the immune system's complexity reflects the need to avoid reactivity with self antigens rather than the number of foreign antigens it protects against.
