tldr: The authors describe a high-frequency, damped balance used to measure forces in strong magnetic fields. They present a general formula for designing the balance and discuss its application in measuring the magnetisation of various substances. The authors also examine the performance of the balance in strong magnetic fields and discuss the influence of the magnetic field on the oscillograph. Their experiments contribute to the understanding of magnetisation changes in stronger magnetic fields.
