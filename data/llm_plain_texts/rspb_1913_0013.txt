tldr: This study investigates the influence of arterial wall resilience on blood pressure and the pulse curve. The authors found that the resilience of the arterial wall affects the conduction of the systolic wave and the blood pressure, as measured by a sphygmometer. The study also demonstrated that the nature of the arterial wall plays a significant role in the pulse curve, which has not been previously considered.
