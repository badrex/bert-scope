tldr: The author presents a general adsorption equation for the adsorption of long-chain ions from water to air or oil interfaces. The equation is derived by considering the electrical double layer energy and is applicable to both ionized and un-ionized solutes. The author tests the equation using recent experimental data on the adsorption of long-chain sulfate ions at the air/water and oil/water interfaces. The equation simplifies to the Langmuir, Kiister (Freundlich), and Temkin isotherms under certain conditions.
