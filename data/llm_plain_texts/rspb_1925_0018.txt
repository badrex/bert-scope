tldr: The authors conducted a study on the anatomy and physiology of the air-bladder and Weberian ossicles in Cyprinid fish. They discovered the swim-bladder's connection to the oesophagus and the presence of an anterior chamber. The study also examined the reactions of fish to vibrations and the effects of puncturing the sacs. The research provided insights into the function of the swim-bladder and the Weberian ossicles in relation to hearing in fish.
