tldr: The authors propose a theory that explains how the cerebral neocortex, a part of the brain responsible for various tasks, organizes and processes information using a few fundamental techniques. They introduce the concept of classificatory units, which are formed based on past experiences and help interpret new inputs. The theory also includes an information-theoretic approach to diagnose and interpret inputs and the formation of new classificatory units. This theory provides a general framework for understanding how the brain processes different types of information.
