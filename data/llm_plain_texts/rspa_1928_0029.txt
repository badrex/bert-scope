  - Magnetic properties
tldr: The authors studied the specific heats and thermal properties of ferromagnetic substances, particularly manganese compounds. They found that heat is rapidly absorbed when the substance changes from ferromagnetic to paramagnetic state, and the thermal and magnetic phenomena are closely related. The results suggest that magnetic changes are associated with a heat of transformation, and the transformation may not be complete at the critical point.
