tldr: The authors investigated the types of mitosis occurring in cutaneous epithelium that has been artificially stimulated to proliferate. They found that both normal somatic and reduction mitoses occur in the epithelial proliferation caused by scharlach R. The study aimed to understand the significance of reduction mitosis in cancerous and non-cancerous proliferation, but no clear conclusion was reached regarding its meaning. The research also showed that the number of chromosomes in mitosis varies, suggesting that it may not be fixed.
