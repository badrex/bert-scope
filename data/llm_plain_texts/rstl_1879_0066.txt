tldr: The author investigates the sensitive state of electrical discharges through rarefied gases, discovering that it is due to a periodic intermittence in the discharge. They explore various methods of producing this sensitive state and examine the characteristics of both sensitive and non-sensitive discharges. The study provides insights into the nature of vacuum discharges and their potential applications.
