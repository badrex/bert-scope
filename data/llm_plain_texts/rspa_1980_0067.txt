tldr: The author recounts their journey into the field of solid state physics, focusing on their interest in dislocations and their impact on the properties of metal crystals. They discuss their experiences at the Philips Research Laboratory, where they studied recrystallization and the effects of cold work on metals. The author also highlights the work of other researchers, such as Dehlinger, who contributed to the understanding of lattice imperfections and dislocations in crystals.
