tldr: This article investigates fluctuations in atmospheric carbon-14 concentrations during the past century. The authors found that short-term fluctuations in carbon-14 concentrations are negatively correlated with solar activity, with maximum correlation occurring one year before sunspot maxima. The overall magnitude of these fluctuations is 3% of the natural carbon-14 concentration, which is attributed to variations in the isotope production rate due to solar modulation of the galactic cosmic ray flux. The authors propose that these fluctuations result from solar-sensitive mixing of stratospheric and tropospheric air masses through variations in ultraviolet and corpuscular radiation over each solar cycle. These findings have implications for the radiocarbon dating method and understanding natural carbon-14 activities in the troposphere.
