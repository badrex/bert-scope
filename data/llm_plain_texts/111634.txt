tldr: This article discusses two major storms that occurred in October and November 1859. The author, Rear-Admiral FitzRoy, analyzes the storms' characteristics, including their wind patterns, barometric pressure, and temperature changes. He explains the differences in weather patterns between the two storms and how they were influenced by the cold, dry, polar atmospheric current and the warm, moist, equatorial air streams. FitzRoy also highlights the importance of using telegraphic communication to give early warnings of storms to distant locations.
