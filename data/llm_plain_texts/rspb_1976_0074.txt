tldr: The authors studied the spontaneous activity of neurons in the cat's cerebral cortex using chronically implanted microelectrodes. They found that trains of action potentials can be described using a -normal distribution, requiring only two parameters: modal interval and standard deviation. This description was applicable to neurons in various cortical areas and across different behavioral states of the animal.
