tldr: The author investigates the mean effects of large magnetic disturbances and discovers periodical laws governing them. These laws include systematic order and regularity with periods of 1 solar day, 1 solar year, and a 10-year cycle corresponding to the solar spot cycle. The study confirms the existence of periodical laws for all three magnetic elements: Declination, Inclination, and Total Force.
