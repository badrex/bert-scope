semantic_tags:
  - Neurotransmitter Receptors
  - GABA Receptors
  - Membrane Channels
  - Locust Muscle Fibers
  - Inhibitory Receptors
tldr: The article investigates the presence of both junctional and extrajunctional GABA receptors in locust muscle fibers. It demonstrates that these receptors are distinct from extrajunctional glutamate receptors and that the mean channel lifetime decreases with membrane hyperpolarization. The study provides valuable information about GABA receptors in various organisms and contributes to the understanding of inhibitory neurotransmission in locust muscles.
