tldr: This study investigates the relationship between dietary starch intake in rats and the growth of the parasitic worm Moniliformis dubius. The results show that the growth of both the host and the parasite is closely related to the amount of starch consumed by the host. The presence of a suitable source and quantity of available glucose in the rat's diet is essential for the growth of Moniliformis.
