tldr: Signy Island, a part of the South Orkney Islands, is home to a diverse range of habitats and ecosystems. The island's climate is typical of the Maritime Antarctic zone, with low temperatures and strong winds. The island's varied terrain supports three main series of plant communities, and its coastal areas are inhabited by large populations of seabirds. The island's soil formation is influenced by solifluxion processes and glacial origins. Research on Signy Island's terrestrial, freshwater, and inshore benthic marine ecosystems has provided an overall picture of the land and freshwater ecosystem in the outer Antarctic zone.
