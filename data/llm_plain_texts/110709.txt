tldr: The author conducted tide observations at Plymouth, Liverpool, and Bristol to study the laws of the rise and fall of the sea. They used mathematical modeling to represent the height of the water surface and found that the curve representing one tide would be the figure of signs. This research contributes to understanding tides and coastal studies.
