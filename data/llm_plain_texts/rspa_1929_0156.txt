tldr: 'The absorption coefficient for slow electrons in mercury vapour was studied by varying the temperature and pressure. The results showed that the absorption coefficient did not exhibit a Ramsauer effect and decreased with increasing electron velocity. A maximum was observed at 35 volts, followed by a decrease in the coefficient with further increasing velocity. The study also discussed the limitations of previous experiments and their discrepancies.'
