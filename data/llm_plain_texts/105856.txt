tldr: In 1769, Francis Wollaston observed the transit of Venus and the solar eclipse from East Dereham, Norfolk. He used a reflecting telescope to make precise measurements and recorded his findings in letters to the Rev. Nevil Maskelyne. Wollaston's observations contributed to the understanding of the solar system and celestial mechanics during that time.
