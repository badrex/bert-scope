tldr: The authors studied the hematin content of horseradish peroxidase, an enzyme, and found that it contains both active and inactive hematin. They discussed various possibilities for the enzyme's composition and structure, including the presence of a hematin compound and the removal of inactive hematin during the enzyme's activity.
