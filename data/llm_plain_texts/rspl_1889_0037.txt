tldr: The author investigates the chemistry of storage batteries, focusing on the reactions occurring during charging and discharging. They discover that the lead sulfate formed and decomposed in the cell is not the ordinary white sulfate known to chemists. The author studies the action of dilute sulfuric acid on litharge and minium, the two lead oxides used in storage cell plates, and identifies the composition of the lead sulfate formed in the cell. This research is crucial for understanding the functioning of storage batteries and improving their performance.
