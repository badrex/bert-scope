tldr: This study investigates the application of the uranyl-oxalate actinometer at high intensities produced by gaseous flash discharge lamps. It is found that the decomposition of oxalate is directly proportional to intensity over a 1000-fold range, and the quantum yield remains unchanged at these high intensities. This allows the uranyl-oxalate system to be used for comparative and absolute energy measurements in flash discharge photochemistry.
