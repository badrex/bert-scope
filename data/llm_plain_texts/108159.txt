tldr: 'The author, Michael Faraday, conducted experiments with the Gymnotus fish to investigate the identity of its electrical power with common electricity. He compared the Gymnotus with the Torpedo and found that the electrical power in both animals was the same. The experiments involved using different collectors and apparatus to measure the strength and direction of the electric current. The findings contribute to the understanding of animal electricity and its connection to inorganic electricity.'
