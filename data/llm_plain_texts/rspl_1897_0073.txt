tldr: The author investigates the discontinuous variation in Biscutella laevigata, a plant species with two distinct forms: hairy and glabrous. They observe that these variations cannot be explained by environmental factors and suggest that a detailed study of these differences in leaf surface might lead to interesting results in understanding the origin of species.
