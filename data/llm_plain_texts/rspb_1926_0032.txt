revised_title: 'The Fate of Disappeared Sugar under Insulin Action'
semantic_tags:
  - Insulin
  - Glycogen
  - Blood sugar
  - Inorganic phosphorus
  - Eviscerated spinal preparation
tldr: The author investigates the fate of sugar that disappears from the blood under the action of insulin. They use an eviscerated spinal preparation to study the effect of insulin on glycogen content in muscles. The results show that insulin causes a decrease in inorganic phosphorus in the blood, and when the blood sugar is prevented from falling, the fall in blood phosphate persists. This indicates that the phosphorus disappearing from the blood goes to the muscles.
