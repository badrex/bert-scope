tldr: In this article, John Tyndall conducts experiments to understand the absorption and radiation of heat by gases and vapors. He uses a specially designed galvanometer to measure the effects of various gases, such as oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen, on heat transmission. Tyndall discovers that gases do not significantly absorb radiant heat, which leads to advancements in understanding the Earth's atmosphere and heat transfer processes.
