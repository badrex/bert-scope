tldr: The article discusses the identification and characterization of stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs), which are involved in cellular responses to various environmental stresses. These pathways are distinct from the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways and play a crucial role in regulating transcription factors like c-Jun and ATF2. Understanding these pathways can help in developing therapies for inflammatory diseases and reperfusion injury.
