tldr: The study investigates the effects of sodium, hydrogen, and magnesium ions on mitochondrial calcium sequestration in adult rat ventricular myocytes. The results show that raising the sodium concentration reduces the final quantity of calcium accumulated, suggesting a sodium-sensitive fraction of net calcium exchange. The findings indicate that part of the inotropic effects of these ions could be mediated through mitochondria, which play a role in modulating sarcoplasmic calcium levels.
