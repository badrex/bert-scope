tldr: The authors develop a hybrid method called the variational-bound nip-element method for solving geometrically stiff problems in thermal composites and porous media. This method combines variational bounding techniques and the finite-element method, allowing for rigorous calculations of effective properties while reducing geometrical stiffness. The authors apply this method to the random two-dimensional thermal composite problem and the random fibrous porous media problem, providing accurate results for effective thermal conductivity and permeability.
