tldr: This article discusses the influence of iron in ships on magnetic needle anomalies and introduces a new genus of Ocythoe, a type of testaceous Mollusca. The author suggests that the iron used in ship construction may be the source of these anomalies and that the Ocythoe's shell is not made for its body, as it resides only in the last volutation of the shell.
