tldr: The authors develop a theory for the flow properties of substances that exhibit elastic recovery, focusing on dispersions of elastic spheres in a Newtonian fluid. They derive a set of differential equations and relate the parameters to the structural properties of the materials, providing a general framework for understanding the behavior of these substances.
