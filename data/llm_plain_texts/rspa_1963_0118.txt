semantic_tags:
  - Neutron diffraction

tldr: 'This article presents neutron diffraction studies on the actinide oxides, uranium dioxide, and thorium dioxide. The authors investigate the thermal motions of the atoms in these materials between room temperature and 1100°C. They find that the value of the thermal parameter 9 is uncertain at low temperatures but can be determined accurately above a certain threshold. The results provide evidence for the composition and structure of these materials.'
