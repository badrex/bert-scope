tldr: This article discusses the polymorphic changes of ammonium nitrate, a compound that undergoes four distinct transformations within a specific temperature range. The author examines the physical properties, crystal structures, and volume changes of each modification, as well as the relationship between the two tetragonal modifications. The study also includes measurements of specific heat and heat of transformation for the compound.
