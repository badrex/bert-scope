tldr: This article investigates the mathematical properties of discrete space theory in radiative transfer, focusing on stability and non-negativity of solutions. The authors demonstrate that cell matrices, which represent layers of scattering media, are dissipative, non-negative, and possess other important properties when using thin-layer formulae. These findings contribute to the development of practical algorithms for solving radiative transfer problems.
