tldr: The authors studied the structure and behavior of thin films of normal paraffins using electron diffraction. They found that the films were crystalline and that the molecular positions were determined by the crystal structure. The films lost their orderly arrangement when heated, and the disorientation temperature depended on the molecular composition and film thickness. The results suggest a transition from a condensed to an expanded film structure in monolayers.
