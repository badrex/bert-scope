tldr: This article explores the relationship between plant life histories and the composition of insect communities associated with them. It examines the evolution of insect host associations and how the composition of a component community affects plant evolution. The authors discuss the role of phylogenetic history and genetic constraints in determining a plant's insect fauna and the importance of understanding these relationships for the study of plant-insect interactions and coevolution.
