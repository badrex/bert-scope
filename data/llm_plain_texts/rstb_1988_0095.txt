tldr: 'This article explores the role of genetic factors in determining susceptibility to infectious diseases. It discusses the association between genetic polymorphisms, such as red-cell polymorphisms involving haemoglobin, enzymes, and membrane structure, and resistance to malaria. The article also highlights the potential involvement of the HLA-DR system in modifying the clinical course of bacterial, viral, and parasitic infections.'
