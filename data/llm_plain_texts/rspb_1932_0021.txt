tldr: The authors studied the analysis and synthesis of virus diseases in potatoes, identifying three distinct viruses (X, Y, and Z) and their interactions within a single plant. They observed the clinical symptoms of these diseases and how they can be modified by passing through different plant species. The study provides insights into the classification and transmission of virus diseases in potatoes.
