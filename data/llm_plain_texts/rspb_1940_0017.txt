tldr: The author investigates the hardening mechanism of the ootheca of the cockroach Blatta orientalis. They find that the ootheca is mainly composed of a protein, likely keratin, with a well-developed system of primary valence cross-linkages responsible for its resistance to enzymes and chemical reagents. The ootheca hardens due to the oxidation of an ortho-dihydroxyphenol, and its secretion is derived from the colleterial glands of the female cockroach.
