tldr: This study investigates the development of ionic conductances in neurons of the inferior olive in rats using an in vitro approach. The research found that neurons at different postnatal stages exhibit a variety of ionic conductances, including sodium-dependent spikes, calcium spikes, potassium currents, and inward rectification. The balance between potassium and calcium currents changes throughout maturation, with potassium currents dominating until the end of the first postnatal week. The study also observed the late development of electrotonic coupling between olivary neurons.
