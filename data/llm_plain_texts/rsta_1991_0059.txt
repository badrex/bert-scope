tldr: This article explores the inverse-square sound speed profile in ocean-surface waveguides, which can be either upward or downward refracting. The author analyzes the properties of the sound field in these waveguides, including near-field components and trapped radiation represented by normal modes. The inverse-square theory is applied to Arctic Ocean transmissions and compared with observations of ambient noise in the Greenland Sea. The article also discusses the potential of acoustic techniques in studying sea-surface processes and the challenges in predicting the effects of transmission paths on received signals.
