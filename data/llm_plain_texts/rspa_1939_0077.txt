tldr: This article classifies the four types of Coriolis perturbation in tetrahedral molecules, specifically focusing on methane. The authors use group theory to derive general formulae for the matrix elements of these perturbations, which can be used to analyze the vibrational-rotational spectrum of methane and understand the effects of Coriolis perturbations on its infra-red absorption bands.
