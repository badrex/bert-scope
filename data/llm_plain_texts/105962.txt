tldr: The author, James Ferguson, presents a new method for constructing sun-dials without the need for dialing scales or logarithmic calculations. The method involves using geometrical techniques to determine the position of the sun-dial based on the latitude of the location. This innovative approach simplifies the process of creating sun-dials and makes them more accessible to a wider audience.
