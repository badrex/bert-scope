tldr: The study investigates the arrangement of myosin on the surface of paramyosin filaments in the white adductor muscle of the oyster Crassostrea angulata. The researchers used electron microscopy and metal shadowing techniques to reveal the surface structure of the intact thick filaments. The findings show a regular arrangement of round objects on the filament, interpreted as groups of myosin heads, forming the Bear-Selby net pattern. This discovery helps to understand the structure and function of the thick filaments in molluscan muscles.
