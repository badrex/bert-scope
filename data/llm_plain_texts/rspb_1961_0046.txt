tldr: The authors discovered that Emericellopsis minima (Stolk) and related fungi produce a substance resembling 6-aminopenicillanic acid. They found that this substance is stable at low pH and is destroyed by penicillinase, suggesting that it is a type of penicillin. The authors also identified the presence of penicillin amidase activity in the culture, which supports the formation of 6-aminopenicillanic acid.
