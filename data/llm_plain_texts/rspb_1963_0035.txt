revised_title: 'Intracellular Degradation of Ribonucleic Acid in the Cell Nucleus'
semantic_tags:
  - RNA degradation
  - Polynucleotide phosphorylase
  - Ribonucleic acid
  - Chromosome complex
  - Nucleus
tldr: The author investigates the breakdown of ribonucleic acid (RNA) in the cell nucleus and discovers that the enzyme responsible for this process is a polynucleotide phosphorylase. This enzyme acts preferentially on rapidly labeled RNA and appears to degrade it to nucleoside-5' diphosphates. Both the rapidly labeled RNA and the enzyme are apparently attached to the chromosome, suggesting that they form part of the chromosome complex itself.
