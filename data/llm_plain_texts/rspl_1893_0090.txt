tldr: The author studied the development of the marine organism Asterina gibbosa and provided a detailed account of its organogeny and larval stages. The research focuses on the formation of the water-vascular system, the absence of coelomocoele, and the transformation of the preoral lobe into a stalk. The findings contribute to the understanding of echinoderm development and evolution.
