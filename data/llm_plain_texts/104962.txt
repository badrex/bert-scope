tldr: In November 1755, an earthquake struck Valais in Switzerland. Mons. Bonnet, a French researcher, shared details of the event in a letter to Mr. Trembley. The earthquake was felt throughout the region, and it was reported that the earth opened in some places, creating springs. The inhabitants of the area retreated to the mountains, where they found safer accommodations in wooden houses.
