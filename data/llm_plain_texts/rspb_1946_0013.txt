tldr: 'This study investigates the efficiency of the rabbit's nose in filtering out airborne droplets and particles. The researchers found that droplets larger than 10 micrometers are filtered out in the nose, while smaller particles can pass through and reach the lungs. This information can help assess risks to human subjects and understand the biochemical and physiological processes following particle deposition.'
