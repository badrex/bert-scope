tldr: The authors conducted electrophysiological studies on oxytocin and vasopressin-secreting neurons in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus in lactating rats. They found that these neurons can be differentiated into two functionally distinct populations based on their firing patterns during reflex milk ejection and haemorrhage. Oxytocin-secreting neurons show a high-frequency discharge before milk ejection, while vasopressin-secreting neurons adopt a phasic pattern of firing during vasopressin release induced by haemorrhage.
