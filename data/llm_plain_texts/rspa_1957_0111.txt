tldr: The authors discuss the presence of ions and free radicals in planetary atmospheres, particularly focusing on the atmosphere of Venus. They explore the possible causes of its yellow color and the role of molecules like CO+ and CO2 in the atmosphere's fluorescence. The study suggests that further observations and analysis of Venus's atmosphere and the absorption and fluorescent spectra of potential molecules are necessary for a better understanding of the planet's atmosphere.
