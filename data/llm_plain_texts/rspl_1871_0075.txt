tldr: The author, Francis Galton, aims to define the meaning of "kinship" and analyze the connections between individuals, hereditarily, to their parents, siblings, and more distant relatives. He introduces the concepts of "Class Representation" and "Family Representation" to describe the transmission of genetic traits and qualities through generations. This study helps to understand the complexities of heredity and blood relationships.
