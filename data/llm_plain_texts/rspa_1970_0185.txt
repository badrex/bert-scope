tldr: The article explores the number of distinct periodic forests with the largest clearings of size n ≥ 4. The author demonstrates that there exist an infinite number of such forests for all n ≥ 4. The study uses mathematical concepts like graph theory, combinatorics, and number theory to analyze the structures and patterns of these forests.
