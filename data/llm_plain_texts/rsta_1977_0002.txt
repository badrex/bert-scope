tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the oxygen isotope abundance in fine size fractions of Luna 16 and 20 soil samples. They found that a simple monotonic increase in abundance with decreasing grain size does not exist. The results fall within the range of values found by other researchers for lunar soils. The authors discuss three possible interpretations of the patterns: (1) heavy isotope enrichments reflect fractional evaporation and/or condensation processes due to bombardment by nuclear particles, (2) concentrations of minerals with low 18O abundances or phases enriched in 18O, and (3) exposure of the samples to the atmosphere of various laboratories.
