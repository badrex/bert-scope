tldr: This study investigates the effect of functional activity on metabolism, blood flow, and exudation in organs. The researchers examined the gastrocnemius and diagastric muscles, measuring blood flow, oxygen consumption, and exudation. They found that during stimulation, oxygen consumption and blood flow increased, while exudation remained relatively constant. The results suggest that functional activity affects organ metabolism and blood flow.
