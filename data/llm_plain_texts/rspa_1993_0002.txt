tldr: The authors introduce the concept of the shift lattice, a generalization of the lattice concept, to describe the properties of ordered, non-periodic systems. They explore the one-dimensional shift lattice and its Fourier transform, and discuss its applications to specific systems and its relation to modulated structures. The shift lattice provides a complementary perspective for understanding the evolution of certain structures with chemical composition, temperature, and other parameters.
