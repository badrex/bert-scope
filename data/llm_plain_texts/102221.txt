tldr: Edmund Hally corrects the motion theory of Saturn's satellite discovered by Christian Huygens. He observed the satellite's period and made tables to improve the understanding of its orbit. Hally also discussed the eccentricity in the satellite's orbit and the need for more observations to determine the satellite's position accurately.
