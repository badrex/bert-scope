tldr: The author, S. Scott Alison, discovered that water can intensify sound transmission through solid bodies. By immersing a hearing tube in water or using a water-filled bag, the sound can be heard more clearly. This effect is due to the liquid's ability to better enclose the air column and reduce the interference of solid materials. The author also experimented with other liquids and materials, but water provided the greatest augmentation. The hydrophone, a water-filled device, was developed to enhance sound reinforcement.
