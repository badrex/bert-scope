tldr: The authors discuss the two coefficients of viscosity for an incompressible fluid containing air bubbles. They find that the second coefficient of viscosity is 4/3 times the first, and the fluid's compressibility affects its behavior. This study helps to understand the properties of liquids and their applications in various fields.
