tldr: The author studied the life-history of Bacterium termo and Micrococcus, two common organisms. They discovered that Bacterium termo can develop into filaments containing spores, which can then germinate into short rods. Micrococcus was found to be a distinct organism, possibly a spore form of a bacterium that has lost its ability to germinate under normal conditions. The author also observed that desiccation can destroy bacterial rods but not spores or Micrococci, suggesting that these organisms can survive in the air and settle in suitable environments.
