tldr: The authors conducted a detailed study of optical isotope shifts and hyperfine structure in cadmium using high-resolution digital recording interferometry. They measured the relative positions of all stable isotopes in various spectral lines and determined the King parameters, which relate shifts in different lines. The study provides precise data for theoretical interpretation and comparison with results from other experiments, contributing to the understanding of atomic and nuclear properties of cadmium.
