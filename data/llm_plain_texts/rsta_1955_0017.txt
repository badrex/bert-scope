tldr: This article presents an interpretation of gravity results obtained by the 1950 British Submarine Gravity Survey in the Eastern Mediterranean. The author discusses the different gravity anomalies in the region and their relation to tectonic positions. The study covers four separate problems: the environs of Malta, the Crete island arc, Cyprus, and the Nile delta. The findings provide insights into the processes involved in the geological evolution of the area.
