tldr: 'The authors conducted an experiment to directly measure the rate of alpha-particle emission from uranium. They used a zinc sulphide screen to observe scintillations caused by alpha-particles from pitchblende samples. The results showed that uranium emits a significant number of alpha-particles per second per gram, which is in fair agreement with Rutherford's findings on radium.'
