tldr: The author presents a modified version of Rumford's method for comparing the intensity of different colored lights. The new method involves creating equal-sized shadows of the light sources and using a divided lens to adjust the illumination. The author also discusses the use of absorbing media, such as red glass and ammoniacal copper sulfate solutions, to separate different portions of the spectrum. The experiments focus on the relationship between the horse-power expended, the light produced, and the number of armature revolutions in a Gramme-type machine.
