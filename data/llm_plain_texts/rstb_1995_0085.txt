tldr: This study combines data from larval morphology, adult morphology, small subunit rRNA gene sequences, and large subunit rRNA gene sequences to analyze the phylogeny of 29 extant echinoids and 13 extinct taxa. The research demonstrates that larval and adult morphological evolution has proceeded in a mosaic-like fashion over the last 250 million years, and that larval characters appear to be more prone to homoplasy than adult characters. The study also finds weak correlation between rates of ribosomal RNA evolution and rates of morphological evolution, suggesting that morphology and ribosomal genes have evolved largely independently.
