tldr: 'This article by R. H. Lock and W. Bateson explores the inheritance of certain invisible characters in peas. They discovered that the grey color of the testa, associated with colored flowers and axils, is a dominant trait over colorless testas with white flowers and green axils. The researchers also found that the invisible characters of the testa can be explained by Mendel's law of segregation and that the hidden factors come from the white-flowered parent.'
