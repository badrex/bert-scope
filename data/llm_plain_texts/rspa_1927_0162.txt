tldr: This article investigates the density of the vapour in a mercury arc and its impact on the intensities of radiated spectral lines. The authors found that an increase in vapour density enhances the brightness of certain spectral lines, while a decrease in density results in the opposite effect. This study provides insights into the behavior of spectral lines and the underlying physical processes in mercury vapor discharge.
