tldr: The article presents a theory for the propagation of nonlinear hyperbolic waves of any strength, focusing on small wavelengths. The theory involves solving one-dimensional constant coefficient nonlinear equations initially, followed by the use of weakly nonlinear geometrical optics. This method allows for the evolution of nonlinear hyperbolic waves to be tracked, providing a way to follow their behavior over time.
