tldr: The authors discovered that bull spermatozoa can increase the effective diffusion coefficient of oxygen in the suspending medium by 900%. They found that this is due to the existence of short-range order in bull sperm suspensions, which causes group sperm velocities greater than those of isolated spermatozoa. This increased diffusion allows for larger volumes of the suspending medium to be convected with the ordered sperm groups, leading to an augmented diffusion of oxygen. The authors examined this phenomenon through respirometric experiments and photomicrographs of sperm suspensions at different dilutions and temperatures.
