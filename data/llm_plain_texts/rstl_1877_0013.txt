tldr: The author presents the complete statement of the Magnetic Survey of the Globe, covering four zones from the equator to 40°S latitude. The study aims to establish the rate of secular change in the Earth's magnetic field and improve the understanding of magnetic relations in the equatorial regions. The findings contribute to the development of magnetic maps and the overall knowledge of terrestrial magnetism.
