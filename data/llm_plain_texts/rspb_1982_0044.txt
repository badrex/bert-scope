tldr: The authors studied the water content and pore size profiles in Sphagnum and peat to understand their relationship with peat bog ecology. They found that Sphagnum species have different water content and pore size structures, which affect their growth and distribution in peat bogs. The study provides insights into the ecological significance of these differences and the importance of water supply for Sphagnum growth.
