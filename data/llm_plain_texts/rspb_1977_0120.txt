tldr: This article discusses the surgical needs and priorities in rural health, comparing contemporary western surgical needs with those of less developed countries. It outlines the surgical needs of poor societies, such as trauma, childbirth, congenital defects, and vision issues, particularly cataracts. The article also highlights the importance of appropriate surgical techniques, anesthesia, and the use of antibiotics in rural settings. The author emphasizes the need for a pyramid-like structure of surgical services, with peripheral hospitals handling simpler surgeries and central hospitals handling more complex cases.
