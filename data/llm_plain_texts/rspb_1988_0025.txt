tldr: This study examines the biogeographical patterns of hydrothermal-vent fauna in the eastern Pacific Ocean, focusing on the differences between the fauna of the Juan de Fuca and East Pacific Rise systems. The authors find that the fauna of the Juan de Fuca Ridge has formed an endemic assemblage of lower diversity, suggesting low rates of speciation. The study provides insights into the dispersal and evolution of these unique organisms, which are adapted to chemosynthetic productivity in their extreme environments.
