tldr: This article presents a study of the semidiurnal tides at Frederiksdal, a location near Cape Farewell in Greenland. The author, Samuel Haughton, conducted observations from August 1863 to August 1864, which allowed him to determine the laws of the semidiurnal tides and draw important inferences from them. The study also includes calculations of the eccentricity of the Moon's path, her mass compared to Earth's mass, and the mean depth of the ocean canal traversed by the tide before reaching Frederiksdal.
