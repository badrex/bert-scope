tldr: The author investigates a chemically active modification of nitrogen produced by an electric discharge and compares its energy with that of nitric oxide. The experiments show that the energy of active nitrogen is of the same order of magnitude as that of nitric oxide, and it is likely that active nitrogen exceeds nitric oxide in its endothermic nature. The study provides insights into the chemical reactions and ionization processes involved in active nitrogen.
