tldr: The authors conducted enhanced nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments on elpasolite compounds with lanthanide ions, such as Cs2NaPrCl6, Cs2NaTbCl6, and Cs2NaTmCl6. They found evidence of small distortions from cubic to tetragonal symmetry in these compounds, which can be explained by a small perturbation on the cubic field. The results provide insights into the local symmetry at the lanthanide site and the behavior of these compounds under different conditions.
