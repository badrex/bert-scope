tldr: This article discusses various methods for controlling chaotic behavior in electronic circuits, including system parameter variation, chaotic oscillation absorbers, entrainment, linear feedback control, time-delay feedback, and stabilizing unstable periodic orbits. The goal of these control techniques is to suppress chaos and achieve desired dynamic behavior, such as stable fixed points or periodic orbits, in various applications.
