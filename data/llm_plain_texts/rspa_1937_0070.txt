revised_title: 'The Synthesis of Nitric Oxide and the Role of Active Nitrogen in Chemical Reactions'

  - Nitric oxide synthesis

  - Chemical reaction kinetics
  - Active nitrogen
  - Time effect
tldr: The author investigates the synthesis of nitric oxide through electric discharge and discovers that the yield of nitrogen oxides is independent of power after an initial stage. They find that a "time effect" occurs, where some nitric oxide is destroyed between its formation and refrigeration. This destruction is associated with the presence of nitrogen, suggesting that active nitrogen plays a role in the chemical reaction.
