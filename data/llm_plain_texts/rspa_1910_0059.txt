revised_title: 'Investigation of the Direction of Motion of Electrons Ejected by Ultra-Violet Light'
semantic_tags:
  - Electron motion
  - Ultra-violet light
  - Cathode rays
  - Electromagnetic theory
  - Experimental physics
tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine if electrons ejected from atoms by ultra-violet light have a component of velocity in the direction of light propagation. They found that the electrons do have a component of velocity in the direction of light, supporting the electromagnetic theory of light.
