tldr: The author studied the distribution and ecological factors of the terrestrial invertebrate fauna in the Maritime Antarctic region. They found that the invertebrate fauna varies in different areas due to factors like climate, vegetation, and dispersal mechanisms. Mites and Collembola were the most studied groups, with some species being widespread and others showing affinities between specific areas. The author also discussed the role of habitat distribution and environmental factors in shaping the invertebrate fauna in the region.
