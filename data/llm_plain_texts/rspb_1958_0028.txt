tldr: The author discovered a closed system of cytoplasmic variation in Aspergillus glaucus, where sectors differ from the original parent mycelium in at least five characters. This closed system can initiate cellular differentiation and return to the starting point, providing a flexible mechanism. The study also found that cytoplasmic equilibria can change with time and be influenced by the medium. The existence of a second closed system of cytoplasmic inheritance in the same isolate suggests that such systems are not limited to the A-B phenomenon.
