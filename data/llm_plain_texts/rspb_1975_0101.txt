tldr: The study investigates the organization of visual fields in the hemipteran acone eye, focusing on the optics and the role of rhabdomeres in the ommatidia. The research explores how the eye adapts to different light conditions, with the rhabdomeres moving closer to the cornea in the dark-adapted state and further away in the light-adapted state. The study also examines the visual axes of individual rhabdomeres and the interommatidial angles, providing insights into how the eye processes visual information.
