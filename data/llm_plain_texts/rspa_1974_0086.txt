tldr: The authors measured isotope shifts in the arc spectrum of xenon for all nine stable isotopes. They found that the isotope shifts show departures from a linear relation between neutron number and isotope shift, similar to those found in barium and cesium. The study confirms the hypothesis that the ratio of field-shifts of isotopes should be constant in all lines and provides a better understanding of the anomalies in isotope shifts.
