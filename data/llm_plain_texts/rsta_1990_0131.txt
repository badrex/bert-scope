tldr: 'This article discusses the contributions of Robert Boyle to the field of analytical chemistry. Boyle, famous for Boyle's Law and his work on the air pump, conducted significant research in analytical chemistry, including the nature of elements, solution chemistry, measurements, and clinical chemistry. He made use of flame coloration, luminescence phenomena, and was the first to make quantitative colorimetric analyses. The article highlights Boyle's qualifications to contribute to a discussion meeting on trace analysis and his impact on the early days of the Royal Society.'
