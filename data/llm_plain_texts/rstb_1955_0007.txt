tldr: This study examines the functional morphology, digestive, and reproductive systems of the British Ellobiidae (Gastropoda Pulmonata) species, including Leucophytia bidentata, Ovatella myosotis, Carychium tridentatum, and C. minimum. The research provides insights into the evolutionary and ecological aspects of this family, which are considered the most primitive surviving members of the Pulmonata. The findings contribute to a broader understanding of structure and function in the pulmonates.
