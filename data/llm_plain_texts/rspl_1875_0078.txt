revised_title: Investigating Gas Laws and Isothermals
semantic_tags:

  - Gaseous State
tldr: The author explores the relations of pressure and volume in gases on different isothermals. They find that the value of e(l\#151 ; p) is constant for the same temperature, and they deduce the relations of homologous points. The author also discusses the action of internal attractive forces in the gaseous state and the resistance to volume diminution.
