tldr: This article discusses the interaction between wind and waves, focusing on the effects of wind-generated gravity waves on the air flow. The authors use the quasi-linear theory of wind-wave generation to study the impact of waves on the mean wind profile and find that for young wind sea, most of the stress in the boundary layer is determined by the transfer of momentum from wind to waves, resulting in a strong coupling between air flow and waves. For old wind sea, there is hardly any coupling. The authors also present the first results of coupling a simple surface-layer model with a third-generation wave model, showing that the wave-induced stress has a significant impact on the results for wave height and stress in the surface layer.
