tldr: The author investigates the reaction of methylene with trans and cis butene-2, finding that methylene can be vibrationally excited and may contain excess kinetic energy. This excited methylene reacts with the butenes before losing its excess energy, leading to the formation of various isomers. The study provides insights into the understanding of unimolecular decompositions and the role of collisional stabilization in chemical reactions.
