tldr: The authors conducted experiments on a decerebrate cat to study the process of reflex inhibition and muscle relaxation. They discovered that strong inhibitions can quell the discharging activity of all motoneurons involved in the reflex with a high degree of simultaneity and speed, making the mechanism of the crossed extensor reflex more precise. The study also found that inhibitory relaxation can be caused by both tetanic and single-shock stimuli, and that the after-discharge plateau of the reflex contraction is more susceptible to inhibition than the stimulation plateau.
