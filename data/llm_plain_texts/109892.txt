tldr: The author, Robert Seppings, discusses the benefits of using diagonal braces in ship construction, particularly for ships of war. He provides examples of ships built with and without diagonal braces, demonstrating the improved strength and stability achieved with the new system. The diagonal system is also found to perform better in withstanding the impact of gunfire.
