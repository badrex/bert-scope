revised_title: 'Folding and Misfolding of Proteins: Mechanisms and Chaperone Action'
semantic_tags:
  - Protein folding
  - Protein stability
  - Protein misfolding
  - Chaperone proteins
  - Protein aggregation
tldr: This article discusses the hierarchical structure and folding of proteins, focusing on the mechanisms of folding and misfolding. It explains how folding occurs in a sequential manner, with subdomains and domains folding independently before forming the tertiary structure. The article also highlights the role of accessory proteins, such as chaperones, in catalyzing the rate-determining steps of folding and preventing aggregation. Additionally, it explores off-pathway reactions and the factors that contribute to protein stability.
