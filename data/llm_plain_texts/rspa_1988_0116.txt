tldr: This article investigates the possibility of a singularity occurring in interacting boundary layers when reversed flow is present. The theoretical breakdown takes place at a critical point between separation and reattachment, involving viscous-inviscid interaction between sublayers. The study applies to various interactive flows, including wall jets, liquid layers, hypersonic-limit flow, and short-scale interactions. The occurrence of a pronounced second minimum in skin-friction plots and numerical difficulties in reversed-flow calculations support the existence of this singularity, which offers an explanation for airfoil stall.
