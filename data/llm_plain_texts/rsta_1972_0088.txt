tldr: This article discusses the future of propulsion systems for merchant ships in the 1980s, considering factors such as reliability, safety, pollution, and costs. It compares different types of propulsion systems, including gas turbines, steam turbines, and diesel engines, and predicts that slow-speed diesel and geared steam turbines will be the most widely used systems during that time period. The author also highlights the importance of considering shipowners' attitudes and economic factors when choosing the most suitable propulsion system for each ship.
