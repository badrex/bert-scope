tldr: This paper discusses the dynamical stability and oscillations of floating bodies, specifically ships. The author presents a theorem that calculates a ship's dynamical stability based on the difference of vertical displacements of its center of gravity and the water it displaces. The paper also includes experiments conducted to test the theorem and provides formulas for calculating the times of rolling and pitching for floating bodies. The findings can be used to determine the stability and performance of ships before they are constructed.
