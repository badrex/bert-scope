tldr: The author investigates the interatomic distances in crystals and molecules, finding that there are underlying regularities in bond lengths and atomic numbers. The study examines elements in the first and second short periods and the first long period, discovering direct proportionality between bond lengths and atomic numbers in certain groups. This research contributes to the development of electron theory and understanding of interatomic distances in various substances.
