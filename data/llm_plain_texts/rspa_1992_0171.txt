tldr: The author presents a theoretical model for the initial size distribution of bubbles generated by the shattering of a single air cavity, such as in a breaking wave. The model considers bubble splitting in one, two, and three dimensions, and the resulting distributions are analyzed. The study provides insights into the distribution of bubble sizes in the upper layers of the ocean and has implications for understanding the exchange of gases, underwater sound, and acoustical pulses in the ocean.
