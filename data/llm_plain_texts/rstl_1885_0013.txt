tldr: The author presents results from magnetic observations conducted at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, from 1841 to 1876. They discuss the influence of solar radiation on terrestrial magnetism and the changes in magnetic force throughout the year. The author concludes that the diurnal magnetic changes are mainly due to the sun's radiant heat, with some differences in the effects of solar radiation on land and sea.
