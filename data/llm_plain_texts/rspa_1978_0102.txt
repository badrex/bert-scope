tldr: The article explores the similarity solutions and asymptotic expansions of the Korteweg-de Vries equation and its connection with the Painlevé transcendent. The study reveals the existence of a critical value for the amplitude parameter above which the relevant solutions become singular. The findings have implications for understanding the behavior of nonlinear partial differential equations in various physical and mathematical contexts.
