tldr: The author presents a new formulation of recursion operators that eliminates difficulties associated with integro-differential operators. This approach treats recursion operators and their inverses on an equal footing, allowing for efficient techniques to construct non-local symmetries of differential equations. The new formulation also unifies the construction of generalized and non-local symmetries.
