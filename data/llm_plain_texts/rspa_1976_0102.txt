tldr: This study investigates the speed and profile of steep solitary waves in water using an integral equation approach. The authors found that the speed of a solitary wave does not increase monotonically with wave amplitude, reaching a maximum at a certain point. The highest wave is neither the fastest nor the most energetic. The method also provides a more accurate profile for the free surface of steep solitary waves, confirming previous findings that the highest waves lie beneath their neighbors.
