tldr: The authors study the flow patterns generated by a hovering or slow flying animal within a confined volume, focusing on the interactions between the animal's airflow and the boundaries of the space. They explore the effects of these interactions on flight performance and propose a theoretical model to explain the observed phenomena. The findings have implications for understanding animal flight in confined spaces and for interpreting experimental results on hovering flight performance.
