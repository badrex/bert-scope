tldr: The authors studied the changes in the infrared spectra of molecules, such as methane, ethylene, and hydrogen, when physically adsorbed on porous silica glass. They observed shifts in absorption bands and discovered additional bands in the spectra of adsorbed molecules, which correspond to forbidden fundamental vibration frequencies in the gas phase due to molecular symmetry. This research demonstrates the effect of surface forces on the distortion of molecular symmetry and provides insights into the interaction of molecules with surfaces.
