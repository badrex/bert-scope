tldr: The author, Samuel Hunter Christie, discovered that the rotation of iron in different directions affects a magnetic needle's orientation. This phenomenon led him to investigate the possibility that the Earth's magnetism could be caused by similar principles. He developed an instrument to study these effects and found that the laws governing this action were consistent and uniform, suggesting a connection to the Earth's magnetic field.
