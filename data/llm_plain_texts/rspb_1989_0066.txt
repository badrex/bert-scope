tldr: The study investigates the biogenesis of cyanellae in Cyanophora paradoxa, focusing on the polypeptide composition of the cyanellae. The researchers identify and characterize various photosynthetic components, including cytochrome c-552, ferredoxin, phycobilisomes, photosystem I, and photosystem II. These findings contribute to understanding the molecular dependence of the cyanellae on the host's protein synthetic machinery.
