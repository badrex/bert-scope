tldr: The authors studied the movement of gas in vacuum discharges and observed that the passage of an electric current could either increase or decrease the pressure in the tube. They discovered that this effect was due to the expulsion of occluded gas from one terminal and its occlusion at the other. This phenomenon has significant implications for understanding the mechanism of the discharge itself.
