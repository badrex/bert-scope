tldr: James Walker presents a new method for measuring the resistance of fluids, focusing on steam navigation. He critiques previous experiments for their inaccuracies and proposes a more precise approach using a spring weighing machine. The experiments show that resistance increases at a higher rate than the square of the velocity, and Walker also compares the effects of moving power on railroads and canals.
