tldr: This article investigates the optical properties and chemical decomposition of lead iodide. The authors measure the fundamental absorption spectrum and interpret it in terms of ionization and excitation processes. They also study photoconductivity and photodecomposition, finding that both excitation and ionization processes occur in lead iodide. The occurrence of photodecomposition is mainly determined by the production of excitons, while electron irradiation damage is governed by the ejection of electrons from iodide ions.
