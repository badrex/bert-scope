revised_title: 'Equivalence of Riesz and Residue Methods in Electromagnetic Field Theory'
semantic_tags:
  - Electromagnetic Theory
  - Riesz Method
  - Method of Residues
  - Analytic Continuation
  - Electromagnetic Fields
tldr: The authors demonstrate the equivalence of the Riesz method and the method of residues in solving electromagnetic field problems. They show that both methods yield the same results for the potential and energy density of a point source, and discuss their applications in classical and quantized fields.
