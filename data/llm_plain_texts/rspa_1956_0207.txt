reduced by the use of a thermostatic water-bath, they could not be entirely eliminated. The convection currents caused the particles to drift in the field of view and to collide with one another. The drift of the orbital constant was attributed to these effects. ( b ) Distribution of orientations Measurements were made of the distribution of orientations of the particles in the plane of shear after the suspension had been subjected to shearing for a sufficient time to establish a steady state. The measurements were made by arresting a single particle in the microscope field and noting the orientation of the axis with respect to the direction of flow. The results are summarized in table 2. The distribution of orientations was found to be bimodal, the two maxima being at and. The distribution was the same for all three axis ratios studied.
