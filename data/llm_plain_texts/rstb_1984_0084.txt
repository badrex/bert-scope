tldr: The study describes the anatomy and function of the statocyst-oculomotor system in Octopus vulgaris. It identifies seven extraocular eye muscles and their innervation, and analyzes the central projections of the eye muscle nerves and statocyst nerves. The statocyst-oculomotor system in Octopus includes two pathways from the statocyst equilibrium receptor organs to the motoneurons of the eyes, providing a more complete understanding of the system's function and information processing.
