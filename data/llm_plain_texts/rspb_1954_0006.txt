tldr: The authors investigated the breakdown of phenoxyalkylcarboxylic acids in flax plants and their relation to plant growth-regulating activity. They found that acids with an even number of side chain methylene groups yielded appreciable quantities of phenol, while those with an odd number yielded only traces. The results provide evidence that Î²-oxidation can occur within plant tissue. All ten acids were tested as plant growth regulators using six different methods, showing uniform inactivity in most tests but an unexpected alternation in activity in the Went pea and bean seedling tests.
