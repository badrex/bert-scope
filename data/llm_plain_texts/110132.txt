tldr: The author, James South, conducted a series of observations to determine the discordances between the Sun's observed and computed right ascensions. He used a seven-feet transit instrument and compared the results with other observatories. The study found that the observed right ascension of the Sun was always in excess of the computed one, with a mean excess of 0"6 to 0"7. The author concluded that the cause of this deviation could not be instrumental error or observation error, and he hoped to prove that it was due to imperfections in the solar tables.
