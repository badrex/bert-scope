tldr: This article investigates cellular atmospheric waves in the ionosphere and troposphere, focusing on microbarometric oscillations, billow clouds, and waves in the lee of mountains. The author develops a theory of these oscillations as cellular waves between two horizontal surfaces, explaining their observed frequencies and velocities. The study also explores the effects of wind and the earth's magnetic field on these oscillatory motions.
