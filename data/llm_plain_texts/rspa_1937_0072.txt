tldr: This study investigates the intensity of soft X-rays and photoelectric efficiency of nickel at different temperatures. The researchers found that the secondary electron current decreases suddenly at the Curie point of nickel (358°C), suggesting that the conduction electrons in the metal, which are emitted when the metal surface is bombarded by primary electrons, are also the carriers of the ferromagnetism of nickel.
