tldr: This article presents a rigorous calculation of the free energy and enthalpy available from ATP hydrolysis in the sarcoplasm. The author discusses the factors and assumptions made in the calculation, including intracellular conditions, thermodynamic data, and the extent of deviation from equilibrium conditions. The results show that the free energy available during muscle contraction is around -12 kcal/mol, while the enthalpy of ATP and phosphorylcreatine hydrolysis is approximately -7 kcal/mol.
