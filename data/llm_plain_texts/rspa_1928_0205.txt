tldr: The author investigates the stability of fluid flow in a curved channel, focusing on the effects of small disturbances. They find that certain types of disturbances can cause the flow to become unstable, which may explain why there is no sudden increase in loss of head when the velocity of fluid flowing through a curved pipe exceeds its critical value.
