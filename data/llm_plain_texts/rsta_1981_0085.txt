tldr: This article discusses the reversed field pinch (RFP) concept in plasma physics, which is a method of confining plasma using a toroidal magnetic field. The RFP offers the potential for high-temperature plasma confinement with relatively low magnetic fields. The article reviews the principles of RFPs, their formation through self-reversal, and the latest experimental results, focusing on the Eta Beta II device. It also explores the theory of relaxed states, stability, and the mechanism of self-reversal and relaxation in RFPs.
