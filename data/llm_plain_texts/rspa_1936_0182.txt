tldr: This article investigates the absorption spectra of four aldehydes in the near-infrared region. The authors determined the absorption coefficient of each substance and attempted to interpret the absorption frequencies as overtones and combination frequencies of fundamental vibrations. The study provides insights into the molecular structure and bonding of aldehydes, contributing to the understanding of their chemical properties and potential applications.
