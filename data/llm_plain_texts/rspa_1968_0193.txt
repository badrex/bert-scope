tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the dielectric properties of amino acid solutions, focusing on aqueous e-aminocaproic acid solutions. They measured the complex permittivity of the solutions at various frequencies and temperatures, revealing large dispersions. The authors suggested an interpretation in terms of a Debye type dispersion for three relaxing polar components in the solutions: the solute, water of normal structure, and water with structure modified by the presence of the solute.
