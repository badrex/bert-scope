tldr: The authors introduce a refinement of the Radon transform, which uses a generalized hemisphere instead of the full sphere for the inverse transformation. This refinement provides a more one-to-one correspondence between the function and its transform, and requires less of the transform to reconstruct the function. The authors discuss potential applications in tomography and other areas.
