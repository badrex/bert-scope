tldr: The authors studied the molecular mechanisms of cell transformation by avian sarcoma virus. They identified the transforming gene product, pp60src, as a phosphoprotein with a molecular mass of 60,000. The protein kinase activity associated with pp60src was found to phosphorylate tyrosine residues in polypeptides, suggesting that protein phosphorylation by pp60src may play a major role in transformation. The study provides insights into the biochemical pathways leading to the transformed phenotype.
