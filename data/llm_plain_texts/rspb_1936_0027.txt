tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the fern Asplenium bulbiferum to study the perception and response to gravity, finding that the plants' sensitivity to gravity varies with the time of day and season of the year. They discovered an annual rhythm in graviperception, with higher sensitivity during the summer months and lower sensitivity during the winter months.
