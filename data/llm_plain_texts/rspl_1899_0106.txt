tldr: This article explores the relationship between homogamy (marriage between similar individuals) and fertility, and how it affects evolution. The author argues that while reproductive selection can cause progressive changes in a species, it cannot differentiate a species into sub-groups without the influence of natural selection. The author also discusses the impact of homogamy and fertility on assortative mating, heredity, and the overall evolution of a species.
