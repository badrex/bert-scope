revised_title: 'TRH as a Neurotransmitter Mediating Descending Slow Synaptic Potentials in Rat Spinal Motoneurons'
semantic_tags:
  - Neurotransmitters
  - Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)
  - Spinal motoneurons
  - Slow synaptic potentials
  - Descending tracts
tldr: The article investigates the effects of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) on rat spinal motoneurons. It finds that TRH mimics descending slow synaptic potentials and directly depolarizes motoneurons. The study suggests that TRH may serve as a neurotransmitter mediating these slow synaptic potentials in motoneurons.
