tldr: The author, Francis Galton, examines the Natality Table of Körösi to understand the relationship between the ages of married couples and their offspring's birth rates. He introduces the method of contours or isogens, which he compares to weather charts, to analyze the data. Galton discovers a curious law of natality, where the sum of the father's age, mother's age, and the percentual birth rate remains approximately constant in most cases. This law holds true for marriages where the wife is not older than her husband and is between the ages of 23 and 40.
