tldr: The author, Leonard Horner, conducted research on the geological history of Egypt's alluvial land, focusing on the formation of the alluvial land in the valley of the Nile. He used the annual inundations and sediment deposits to study the changes that have occurred over time. The research aimed to create a chronometric scale to estimate the age of the sediment layers and understand the duration of geological changes in the region.
