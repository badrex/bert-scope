tldr: This study investigates the infrared spectra of 1-butene chemisorbed on silica-supported nickel and platinum over a range of temperatures. The authors found that the chemisorption and hydrogenation of 1-butene on these metals led to the formation of various surface species, which were analyzed using infrared spectroscopy. The results provide insights into the nature of chemisorbed species and their interactions with the metal catalysts.
