tldr: The author, Arthur Cayley, explores the equation for the product of the differences of all but one root of a given equation. He determines the equation for equations of orders three, four, and five, and provides a more general solution for a broader range of equations. The study involves the use of symmetric functions and covariants, which are essential in solving these equations.
