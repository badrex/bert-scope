revised_title: Invariant Theory Under Restricted Groups: Extensions and Applications
semantic_tags:
  - Group Theory
  - Linear Algebra
  - Representation Theory
  - Orthogonal Group
  - Symplectic Group
tldr: This article extends the methods of invariant theory to problems involving restricted groups of transformations, such as the orthogonal and symplectic groups. The characters of these groups are obtained using algebraic methods, and a fundamental theorem is proven that allows for the determination of concomitants in these systems. The article also discusses intransitive and imprimitive transformation groups and their applications.
