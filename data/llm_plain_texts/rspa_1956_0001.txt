tldr: This study investigates the adhesion and friction between clean metal surfaces, revealing that even when surfaces are denuded of surface films, the coefficient of adhesion is still less than unity under static loading conditions at room temperature. However, when sliding is attempted, the adhesion increases significantly. The results suggest that the low initial adhesion can be explained by a simple extension of the McFarlane-Tabor theory, accounting for the effects of elastic recovery.
