tldr: The author observed white lines in the solar spectrum and their changes at different altitudes. They also studied the phenomenon of Venus transit and its effect on the solar spectrum. The observations suggest that Venus's atmosphere might affect the solar light, causing a shaded annulus around Venus. The author also noticed that the white lines in the solar spectrum changed color and became less visible at lower altitudes.
