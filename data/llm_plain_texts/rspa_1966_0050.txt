tldr: This article discusses the nature of seismic noise, which is caused by the interference of seismic signals reflected or refracted by inhomogeneities in the Earth's structure. The authors analyze the statistical properties of seismic noise and propose a method to calculate its average properties using correlation functions. They also explore the scattering of body waves in an inhomogeneous medium and the efficiency of different scattering processes.
