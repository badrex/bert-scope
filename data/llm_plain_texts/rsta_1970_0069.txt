tldr: This article discusses the appearance of photoelectron spectra in diatomic molecules, specifically the vibrational structure and how it is affected by Franck-Condon factors and autoionization. The authors use calculated distributions of Franck-Condon factors to explain the extension of vibrational structure in photoelectron spectra when the exciting radiation's wavelength coincides with a resonance in the photoionization cross-section of a diatomic gas. They also compare experimental resonance wavelength spectra with calculated Franck-Condon factors to provide information about the autoionizing state.
