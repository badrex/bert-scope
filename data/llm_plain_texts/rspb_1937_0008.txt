tldr: 'The authors studied the interaction between large molecules in monolayers and discovered that when a suitable molecular species is injected under a monolayer, a phenomenon called film penetration occurs. This process forms a new, stable mixed film consisting of equimolecular proportions of the original film material and the penetrating substance. The authors found that strong interactions between molecules can lead to the formation of stable complexes, which can have implications for the mechanical stability of natural membranes.'
