tldr: The author studied the development of spinal nerves in elasmobranch fishes, specifically embryos of Scyllium, Scyllium ca, and Torpedo. They discovered that the first appearance and early stages of spinal nerves differ from previous investigations. The study focused on the formation of spinal nerves and their attachment to the neural canal, providing insights into the development of the nervous system in these fish species.
