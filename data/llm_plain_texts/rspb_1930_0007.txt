tldr: The authors conducted experiments on ferret reproduction and discovered that ferrets can remain in a state of oestrus for a long time without mating. They also found that pseudo-pregnancy in ferrets lasts for approximately the same time as actual pregnancy. The study provides insights into ferret reproduction and the factors that influence it, such as the duration of pregnancy and the effects of suckling on the recurrence of heat.
