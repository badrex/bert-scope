tldr: The author describes a method for detecting and measuring stomatal opening in adult leaves using a hygroscope made of "Chinese leaf," which consists of shavings of pressed and heated horn. This method relies on the fact that stomatal transpiration depends on the degree to which stomata are open. The author compares their method to previous approaches using hygroscopic papers impregnated with agents that change color based on their moisture levels.
