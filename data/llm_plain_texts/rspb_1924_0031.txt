tldr: The author investigates the thermodynamic phenomena in shortening and lengthening muscles, discovering that shortening during contraction or lengthening during relaxation produces more heat than an isometric contraction, while lengthening during contraction or shortening during relaxation produces less heat. The findings suggest that these phenomena may be thermo-elastic and thermodynamic in nature, with the muscle's physical properties changing during excitation.
