tldr: This article explores the hypothesis that radiation-induced mutational change is equivalent to spontaneous somatic mutation in humans. The author develops a mathematical model to analyze the effects of acute and chronic irradiations on radiation carcinogenesis, considering dose-response relationships, the influence of age, and tumor incidence over time. The study compares the radiomutability of "carcinogenic genes" in humans with experimental values obtained from irradiated germ and somatic cells in mice, resulting in a consistent interpretation of various types of evidence.
