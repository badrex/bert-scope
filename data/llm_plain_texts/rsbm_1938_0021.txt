tldr: Sydney Young was a prominent chemist who made significant contributions to the fields of thermodynamics, distillation, and azeotropic mixtures. He worked with Sir William Ramsay on the vapour pressures of solids and liquids and later focused on improving distillation methods for separating mixed liquids. His work on fractional distillation and azeotropic mixtures has had lasting impacts on the field of chemistry and is still used today.
