tldr: The author examines the structure and function of the round ligament of the uterus, arguing that it is composed mainly of striped muscle fibers and is not merely mechanically subservient to the process of utero-gestation. The author also discusses the changes that occur in the uterus during pregnancy and the role of the round ligament in copulation.
