tldr: The authors studied the fluorescence spectra of naphthalene and fourteen of its alkyl derivatives, observing similar excimer fluorescence characteristics with mean values of excimer binding energy and excimer interaction energy. They determined the monomer fluorescence quantum efficiencies and ionization potentials of the compounds and analyzed the fluorescence properties of 1,6-dimethyl naphthalene in three solvents to understand the behavior of dilute solutions.
