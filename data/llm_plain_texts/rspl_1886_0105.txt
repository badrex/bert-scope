tldr: The author presents a simple method for constructing the cell of the honey bee using geometrical principles. The method involves inscribing the triangular pyramid of the cell in a sphere and using the properties of the sphere to determine the dimensions of the cell. This approach helps to explain the bees' actions in molding the cells of the honeycomb to observed shapes and may aid naturalists in understanding the bees' behavior.
