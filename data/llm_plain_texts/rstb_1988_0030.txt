tldr: 'The article examines the evolution of climatic variability in the North Atlantic region over the past three million years, focusing on the oxygen-isotope variability in the ocean. The authors found that the amplitude of variability has increased towards the present, with changes in the Earth's orbital geometry playing a significant role. The study highlights the importance of deep-sea sediments in understanding climatic variability and the need for more data from other geological sources.'
