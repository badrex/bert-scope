tldr: The authors studied the kinetics of the reversible hydration of 1,3-dichloroacetone in dioxan and acetonitrile solutions. They found that the reaction is influenced by the concentration of water and the presence of catalysts. The results suggest that the transition state contains one molecule of ketone and three molecules of water in the uncatalyzed reaction, while in the catalyzed reaction, a molecule of triethylamine or benzoic acid can replace one or two molecules of water, respectively. The study provides evidence for a concerted mechanism in the carbonyl hydration reaction.
