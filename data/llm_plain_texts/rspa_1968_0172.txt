tldr: This article presents a study on the high-resolution photoelectron spectroscopy of water and deuterium oxide using helium 584A radiation. The results show extensive vibrational fine structure and discuss the electronic structure of the molecules and the bonding characteristics of their orbitals. The study infers that water has only three configurationally distinct ionization potentials.
