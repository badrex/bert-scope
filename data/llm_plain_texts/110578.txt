tldr: The author, Richard Abbott, investigates the case of a triple integral in the calculus of variations. He explores the variation of the given integral, which is composed of two distinct parts: a triple integral and another part determined from the limits of the triple integral. This work contributes to the understanding of optimization problems and the solution of equations in mathematical analysis.
