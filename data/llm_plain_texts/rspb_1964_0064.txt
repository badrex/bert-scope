tldr: The article discusses the role of ATP-driven active transport of calcium ions in the sarcoplasmic reticulum in regulating muscular contraction. The authors demonstrate that the vesicles in the muscle can accumulate small amounts of calcium and reduce the free calcium concentration, which is essential for maintaining muscle relaxation. The study also shows that the calcium transporting system can store high amounts of calcium in pathological conditions and play a crucial role in excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscles.
