tldr: The author discusses the connection between electric current and electric and magnetic inductions in the surrounding field. They propose a hypothesis that electric and magnetic induction tubes move inwards upon current-bearing wires, with the transfer of energy occurring sideways rather than along the tubes. This hypothesis is based on three general principles of electromagnetic theory and has implications for understanding the behavior of electric and magnetic fields.
