tldr: This study investigates the temporal patterns of clonality and parasitism in a population of freshwater bryozoans, Cristatella mucedo, and the associated prevalence of a myxozoan parasite, Tetracapsula bryozoides. The researchers found that high levels of clonality and parasitism persisted over a three-year period, with four distinct clones identified using random amplified polymorphic DNA markers. The most common clone in the first year became less common by the third year, while the prevalence of the myxozoan parasite varied through time. These findings contribute to understanding the ecology of asexuality and how highly clonal organisms may persist in the face of natural enemies.
