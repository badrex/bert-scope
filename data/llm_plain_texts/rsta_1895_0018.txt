tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the magnetic rotation of the plane of polarization of light in liquids, specifically carbon bisulfide and water. They found that the experimental data for carbon bisulfide's temperature variation of rotation did not agree with previous equations, and provided a detailed examination of factors that could influence the absolute value of the magnetic rotation.
