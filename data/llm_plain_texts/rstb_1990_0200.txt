tldr: This article discusses various methods to estimate the total number of plant and animal species on Earth, such as extrapolating past trends, studying tropical insects, and analyzing species-size relations. The author concludes that the current estimate of 1.8 million species is uncertain and could range from 3 to 30 million species. Recent studies of tropical canopy fauna raise doubts about previous estimates, suggesting that tropical insect faunas may have different patterns of diversity.
