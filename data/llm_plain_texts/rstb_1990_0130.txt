tldr: This article discusses the development and testing of an airborne radar system for Desert Locust control. The system, consisting of an airborne Doppler radar navigation system and an insect-detecting radar, can locate and assess locust populations in semi-permanent wind convergence zones. This technology offers new options for monitoring and controlling locust populations, potentially reducing the environmental impact of control methods.
