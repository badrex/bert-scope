tldr: The authors present a new method to measure binary adsorption isotherms using chromatography. They discovered that the pressure change in the column caused by adding a small perturbation gas flow significantly affects the adsorption isotherms. The study provides a correction term to compensate for the pressure effect, leading to a single isotherm for each component in the gas mixture.
