tldr: The authors studied the melting and crystal structure of cryolite (3NaF, AlF3) and found that the complex anion [AlF6]3- undergoes partial dissociation to [AlF4]- and [F]- in the melt. This dissociation occurs to some extent in the crystal before melting, which contributes to the high conductance of the solid just below the melting point. The large expansion in volume (25%) on melting cryolite is due to extensive formation of positional flaws.
