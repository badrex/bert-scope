tldr: This article discusses strategies and protocols for clinical research in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, focusing on the heart and brain. It highlights the challenges of measuring metabolite ratios and concentrations in vivo and proposes solutions for optimizing spatial resolution, localization techniques, and reproducibility. The article also covers the choice of coils, radiofrequency-field uniformity, patient positioning, and corrections for spectral distortion caused by relaxation.
