tldr: The authors studied the absorption spectra of various cyanine dyes with different heterocyclic nuclei and chain lengths. They found that the color of the dyes is influenced by the nature of the nuclei and the length of the conjugated linkages. Some dyes showed double-banded absorption, with the secondary band appearing on the short wavelength side of the principal band. The presence of quinoline nuclei tends to produce a secondary band in the absorption spectra.
