tldr: This article investigates interfacial waves in pre-stressed layered incompressible elastic solids, focusing on the effects of pre-strain, pre-stress, and material parameters on wave dispersion and filtering. The study considers incompressible materials and provides a dispersion equation for in-plane interfacial waves. The results highlight the influence of pre-stress and deformation on the multiplicity of propagating modes and demonstrate the dependence of wave phenomena on frequency, material properties, and the state of deformation and stress in the half-space and layer.
