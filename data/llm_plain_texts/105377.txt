tldr: In a letter to Thomas Birch, Richard Forster describes a meteor observed in Shefford, Berkshire, on October 20th, 1759. He also shares his observations on the unusually mild winter and its relation to the abundance of mast (provisions) in the previous year. Forster suggests that the plentiful mast might be due to a late spring, which protects the blossoms from inclement weather.
