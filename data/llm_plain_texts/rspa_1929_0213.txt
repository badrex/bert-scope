tldr: The author investigates the resonance and non-resonance in atmospheric waves and tides, focusing on the semidiurnal oscillation in barometric pressure. They analyze the velocity of waves in different atmospheric conditions and discuss the implications of resonance on the explanation of the semidiurnal pressure wave. The study concludes that resonance does not significantly increase the semidiurnal component of pressure variation, leading to a reevaluation of the temperature variation explanation.
