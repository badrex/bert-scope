tldr: 'The author, William Crookes, conducted experiments with high vacuum tubes and discovered a new element, Yttrium, through the study of radiant matter spectroscopy. He found that the element produced a distinct citron-colored band in the spectrum, which helped him identify and isolate the new element. This discovery expanded the understanding of the chemical and physical properties of elements and their interactions.'
