revised_title: 'The Osmotic Pressure and Hydration in Solutions'
semantic_tags:
  - Osmotic pressure
  - Hydration
  - Solution chemistry
  - Thermodynamics
  - Ionization
tldr: The authors derive an equation for osmotic pressure in solutions, taking into account factors such as freezing point depression, vapor pressure lowering, and ionization. They provide a more accurate and simplified form of the osmotic data, which can be used to understand the behavior of solutions and their hydration.
