tldr: The article investigates the differences in gene expression and regulation of human α- and β-globin genes in mouse erythroleukemia cells. It shows that the mechanisms for activating α- and β-globin genes during erythroid cell differentiation are fundamentally different. The study suggests that the sequences responsible for these differences are located within the structural genes.
