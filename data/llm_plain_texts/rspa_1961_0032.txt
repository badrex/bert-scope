tldr: This article investigates the vibrational frequency spectra of disordered diatomic chains with varying proportions of light and heavy atoms. The authors use computational methods to analyze the spectra and find that peaks in the spectra are associated with specific localized chain structures. They also compare their results with previous work using the moment-trace method, highlighting the advantages of their approach in revealing fine details in the spectra of disordered systems.
