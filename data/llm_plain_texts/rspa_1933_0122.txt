tldr: The authors studied the infra-red absorption spectrum of nitrogen tetroxide and found evidence supporting the molecular structure of N2O4. They identified twelve fundamental frequencies and explained how the molecule's vibrations can be built up from the mutual vibrations of two NO2 groups. The study also discussed the selection rules for infra-red frequencies and Raman scattering, and the characteristics of asymmetrical top molecules.
