tldr: This article analyzes the dynamics of a rigid block undergoing harmonic forcing, revealing complex and diverse responses. The author discovers symmetric single-impact subharmonic orbits and period-doubling cascades of asymmetric orbits, which can lead to chaotic behavior. Despite the chaotic nature of the asymptotic domain, the transient response is shown to be quite ordered and predictable, with the concept of the domain of maximum transients introduced to better understand the block's response to earthquakes.
