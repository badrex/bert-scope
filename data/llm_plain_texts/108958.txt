semantic_tags:
  - Governor design
  - Conical pendulum
  - Centrifugal force
  - Time measurement
  - Engine regulation
tldr: The author discusses the limitations of existing governors for uniform rotation and proposes a new chronometric governor based on a conical pendulum. This innovative design provides more accurate time measurement and better regulation of engines under varying load conditions.
