tldr: The study found that zinc enhances the activity of GABAa receptors in skate Muller cells, which are a type of glial cell in the retina. This is different from the inhibitory effect of zinc on GABAa receptors in other types of cells. The findings suggest that the GABAa receptors in skate Muller cells may have a different subunit composition compared to those in other cells.
