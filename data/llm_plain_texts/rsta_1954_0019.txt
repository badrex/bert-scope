tldr: The authors develop a general theory of plane stress for large elastic deformations of isotropic materials using complex variable notation. They introduce an approximation method for unsymmetrical problems and provide a general formulation of the second-order theory for two-dimensional problems, which can be applied to both plane stress and plane strain cases.
