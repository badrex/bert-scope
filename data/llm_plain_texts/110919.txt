tldr: The author studied the motion of small isolated glaciers and observed that their movement is influenced by seasonal changes in temperature. He found that the variations in velocity are greatest in lower valleys where temperature changes are more significant. The author supports the plastic or viscous theory of glacier motion, arguing that crevasses do not affect the overall continuity of the ice mass and that water in crevices plays a crucial role in the force acting on the glacier.
