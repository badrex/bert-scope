tldr: This study investigates the adsorption of argon, nitrogen, and oxygen on smooth platinum foil at low temperatures and pressures. The research extends earlier work by Langmuir, who measured the adsorption of various gases on mica and glass. The authors designed an apparatus to measure adsorption on platinum at temperatures between 77 and 273 Kelvin. They found that the Knudsen thermal transpiration correction was significant and needed to be considered in their calculations. The results provide insights into the behavior of gases on different adsorbent surfaces and contribute to the understanding of surface chemistry and physics.
