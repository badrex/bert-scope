tldr: The author examines the composition of urinary calculi, focusing on the role of lithic acid and lithate of ammonia. They analyze a large collection of kidney stones and find that most calculi either consist of these substances or have them as their nuclei. The author also suspects that carbonate of lime may be a common concomitant of phosphate of lime in calculi. This research contributes to the understanding of the formation and composition of kidney stones.
