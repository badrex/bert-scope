tldr: The article presents an exact solution to the Boltzmann equation for anisotropic metals, assuming that the scattering probability can be written as a finite sum of products of a function of the wave vector and a function of the energy. The solution is derived for arbitrary energy surfaces and can be used to calculate transport phenomena in metals more accurately.
