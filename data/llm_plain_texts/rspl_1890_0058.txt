tldr: The author investigates the relationship between the magnetic permeability of rocks and regional magnetic disturbances. They conducted experiments to determine the order of magnitude of the magnetic disturbances caused by iron-bearing rocks in the Earth's magnetic field. The study aimed to understand the causes of local magnetic disturbances and compare them with the effects of earth currents in the same area.
