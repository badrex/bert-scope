tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the biology of Stereum hirsutum, a common fungus that destroys oak wood. They successfully cultivated the fungus in a pure condition and observed its growth on various media. The fungus forms a dense mycelium that penetrates wood and eventually develops into cushion-like masses. The author also discovered that the fungus produces basidia and basidiospores on small hymenophores, which are small fruiting bodies. This research provides insights into the anatomy and development of Stereum hirsutum and its relationship with wood decay.
