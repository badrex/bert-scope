tldr: This article presents an experiment to study the absorption of hard X-rays by various elements. The authors found that the absorption cannot be explained by a simple relation between absorption and atomic number. They suggest that the absorption per electron must be considered to understand the results. The study also indicates that the relations governing the apparent absorption are of the same type as for alpha rays.
