tldr: This article discusses various mechanisms for determining the length of regular viruses, such as the 'template'-model,'vernier'-model, and 'cumulated strain'-model. The authors analyze the pros and cons of each model and propose that the 'cumulated strain'-model, which considers the entire virus structure as a single protein, could be the most plausible explanation for length determination in supramolecular structures.
