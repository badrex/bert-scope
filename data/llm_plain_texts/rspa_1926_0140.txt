tldr: This article investigates the activation process of chemical reactions on catalytic surfaces, focusing on the behavior of diatomic molecules like hydrogen and nitrogen. The authors discuss the role of adsorbed atoms and the possible changes in their structure that lead to chemical reactions. They also examine the presence of atomic hydrogen on various metal surfaces and its interaction with nitrogen, providing evidence for the importance of atomic hydrogen in catalytic reactions.
