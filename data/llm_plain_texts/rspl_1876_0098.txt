tldr: The author, John Tyndall, discovered a method to sterilize infusions by applying heat in short intervals. This process kills the germs in the infusion, making it safe for use. Tyndall shared his findings with the Royal Society and suggested that continuous boiling for a longer time does not guarantee sterilization. He plans to present his full research to the society soon.
