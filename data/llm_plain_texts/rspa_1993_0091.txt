tldr: The authors studied the electron diffraction patterns of Langmuir-Blodgett films, which are thin layers of amphiphilic molecules. They found that these films can have crystalline structures and used electron diffraction to determine their unit cell parameters and molecular packing. This technique can help understand the properties and potential applications of these films, which include serving as models of biological membranes, electroluminescence devices, sensors, and waveguides.
