tldr: This article explores the accumulation of electrolytes in plant cells, specifically in Valonia cells, through the concept of alternating anionic and cationic phases in the cell membrane. The authors suggest that the relative mobility of ions in the membrane plays a crucial role in the accumulation and distribution of electrolytes within the cell.
