tldr: The authors conducted a series of experiments using frogs to test the physiological effects of digitaline and other organic poisons. They found that animal extracts, such as those from human stomach contents, were toxic to frogs and could be used as a test for the presence of digitaline. The authors also discovered that certain vegetable substances, like lobelia and emetina, could not be detected through their physiological effects on frogs. This research aimed to improve the detection and understanding of organic poisons and their impact on the heart.
