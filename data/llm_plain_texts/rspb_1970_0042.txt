tldr: Researchers discovered a horse with an unusual haemoglobin phenotype in Iran. The horse's haemoglobin pattern on starch gel electrophoresis was different from any other horse studied. The team found a fast/slow haemoglobin ratio of 33/67, and the horse may be a heterozygote for the gene. Further studies on the horse's relatives are needed to confirm the hypothesis.
