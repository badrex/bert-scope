tldr: The author, Peter Martyn, explains the function of the thyroid gland in vocal production. He suggests that the thyroid gland makes the vocal cords rigid, tense, and inflexible, allowing for the production of pure tones. Additionally, the thyroid gland acts as a loader, enhancing the tone's fullness, loudness, and depth. Lastly, the thyroid gland's shape, bulk, density, and pressure help produce the unique qualities of modulation and expression in the human voice.
