tldr: The author investigates the reactions of the dental pulp to peripheral injuries of the dentine. They conducted experiments on monkeys and dogs, creating cavities in the dentine and observing the pulp's response. The results showed various reactions, including changes in the odontoblast layer and the formation of secondary dentine. Some teeth exhibited severe reactions, such as round-celled infiltration and localized granulomas or abscesses. The study provides insight into the complex interactions between the tooth's components and the potential consequences of dental injuries.
