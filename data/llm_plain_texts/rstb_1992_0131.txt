tldr: The article discusses how the plant growth regulator abscisic acid triggers the closing of stomata by activating non-selective Ca2+-permeable ion channels in the plasma membrane of guard cells. This leads to an increase in the free Ca2+ concentration in the guard cell cytosol, causing membrane depolarization and activation of voltage- and second messenger-dependent anion channels and outward rectifying K+ channels, ultimately resulting in stomatal closing.
