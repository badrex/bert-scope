tldr: The author developed a method to measure the thermoelectric power of metals near their melting points, both in solid and molten states. The study focused on metals like Sn, Pb, In, Bi, Cd, and Ga. The results showed a jump in thermoelectric power for some metals when melting, and the author discussed the possible mechanisms of melting, including positional disordering and cooperative positional defects. The author also investigated premonitory effects in metals using electronic properties, such as resistivity changes, to gain insights into the melting mechanisms.
