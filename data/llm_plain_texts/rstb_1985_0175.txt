tldr: 'This article discusses the cell lineage and developmental patterns in the soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The complete cell lineage of C. elegans is described, revealing that the separation of cell types can occur late in the cell division process. The origins of tissues and organs, such as the germ line, intestine, and body muscles, are explored, highlighting the complex and diverse cell lineages. The study provides insights into the mechanisms controlling cell differentiation and patterning in C. elegans.'
