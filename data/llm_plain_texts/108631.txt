tldr: The author, Philip Yorke, conducted experiments to determine the formula of silicic acid by fusing silica with excess alkaline carbonates. He found that the equivalent of silicic acid varied depending on the type of carbonate used, leading to different results. The experiments suggested that the formula of silicic acid might be SiO2, but further research is needed to confirm this.
