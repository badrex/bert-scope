tldr: The authors conducted experiments on a layer of mercury heated from below and subject to a magnetic field and rotation. They found that the critical Rayleigh number for the onset of instability depends on the parameters of the magnetic field and rotation. The results confirm the theoretical predictions of Chandrasekhar, showing that the effect of a magnetic field and rotation on thermal instability is one of inhibition, with the transition between instability modes occurring discontinuously.
