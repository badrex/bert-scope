tldr: The authors developed a new method to determine the conducting power of metals and alloys, which allowed them to examine the influence of adding small amounts of one metal to another. They found that even a 1% addition of a metal can significantly alter the conducting power of an alloy. This research aimed to understand the chemical nature of alloys and amalgams and improve the accuracy of determining their properties.
