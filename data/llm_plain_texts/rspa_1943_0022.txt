  - Reflexion Coefficient
tldr: This article describes a new method and apparatus for measuring secondary electron emission from non-gaseous materials, specifically focusing on low primary energy regions. The authors found that the reflexion coefficient remains relatively constant for low-energy electrons and that the secondary electrons are just reflected electrons. The experiments provide insights into the phenomena in the low energy range, which is essential for understanding the fundamental structure of metallic surfaces and thermionic emission.
