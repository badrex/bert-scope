tldr: This article presents the general structure of integrable evolution equations, which can be solved using the inverse scattering transform. The author demonstrates that the most general integrable evolution equations have a simple and elegant form, allowing for the identification of equations closest to a given equation of interest. The article also discusses the properties of the scattering matrix, the Hamiltonian structure, and constants of motion, as well as the role of quadratic products of eigenfunctions in the theory.
