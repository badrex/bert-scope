tldr: The author presents Castigliano's Principle of Minimum Strain-Energy, which states that a body in equilibrium will have the least strain energy when subjected to a given system of forces. The principle is applicable to any body that obeys Hooke's law and can be used to solve problems of equilibrium, such as flexure, shear, and torsion in uniform prisms. The author also demonstrates how this principle can replace Saint-Venant's semi-inverse method and reduce problems of equilibrium to problems in the Calculus of Variations.
