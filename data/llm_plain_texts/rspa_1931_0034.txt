tldr: The authors investigate the mechanism of adsorption by fuller's earth, focusing on the influence of hydrogen-ion concentration on the adsorption of organic acids and bases from aqueous solutions. They find that two types of adsorption occur: unionized molecules and cations that displace calcium ions from the surface. The results indicate that both polar and apolar adsorption take place, with one process dominating depending on the nature of the adsorbate and the solution.
