tldr: This study investigates the effects of catecholamines and acetylcholine on the reactivation of calcium currents in single guinea-pig ventricular myocytes. Catecholamines increase the initial rate of reactivation, while acetylcholine slows down recovery. These neurotransmitters control the local calcium concentration near the inner surface of the channels, affecting the reactivation process and influencing the heart's rate and response to drugs.
