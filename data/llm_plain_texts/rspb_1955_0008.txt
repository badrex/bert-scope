tldr: This study examines the epicuticle of the cockroach, Periplaneta americana, and identifies four distinct layers: the cuticulin layer, paraffin-containing layer, wax layer, and cement layer. The researchers provide a detailed analysis of each layer's structure, composition, and function, resolving previous conflicting views on the insect epicuticle.
