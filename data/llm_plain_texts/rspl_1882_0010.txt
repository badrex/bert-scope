tldr: The author investigates the phenomenon of hysteresis in the magnetisation of iron and steel, discovering that changes of magnetisation exhibit a static character and that the area of the loop formed by cyclic changes of magnetisation is proportional to the work done on the magnet. The author also explores the effects of stress on magnetisation and suggests a possible explanation for hysteresis based on the frictional sticking of magnetic molecules.
