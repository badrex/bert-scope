tldr: The author investigates the spectrum of magnesium hydride and its production mechanisms. They find that the flutings in the spectrum are due to a combination of magnesium and hydrogen, and that the presence of water vapor is not essential for the production of the hydride spectrum. The author also notes that the enhanced lines appear prominently near the poles of the magnesium arc.
