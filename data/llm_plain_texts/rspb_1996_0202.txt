tldr: The author applies Euler buckling theory to the human lumbar spine, considering it as a vertical column that can buckle under an axial load and undergo periodic motion when displaced by a lateral force. The study suggests that the flexed spine resembles an Euler pendulum, and the bending stiffness of the lumbar spine can be estimated from previous studies on cadaveric spines. The model helps explain the dynamics of the spine and the role of muscles in controlling movement and shock absorption.
