tldr: The author discusses the importance of sensory impressions and sensory centres in the production of voluntary movements. They argue against the existence of motor centres in the cerebral cortex and propose that sensory impressions and the activity of sensory centres guide voluntary actions. The author also explains how speech movements and reading aloud involve the interaction between different sensory centres in the brain.
