tldr: The author, George Rainey, examines the structure of the vascular fringes in joints and tendon sheaths using a microscope. He discovers that these fringes contain a unique arrangement of blood vessels and a specific type of epithelium, suggesting that their primary function is to secrete synovia. This finding challenges the common belief that these fringes only serve a mechanical purpose in filling joint spaces.
