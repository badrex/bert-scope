tldr: This article presents a theoretical study of the spatial distribution of electrons in perfect and imperfect lattices. The authors calculate the electron density for three cases: a perfect lattice, a lattice with a single vacancy, and a lattice with a single impurity. The results show that the density of electrons at a vacancy is not directly proportional to the density of states in the host lattice, and an impurity can cause two bound states to appear from a narrow band. The study provides a tool for understanding the electronic behavior in complex alloy systems.
