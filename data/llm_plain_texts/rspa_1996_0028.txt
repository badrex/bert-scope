tldr: The authors used a boundary-integral equation method to study the flow of a viscous liquid with a free surface down an inclined plane, assuming Stokes flow as a good approximation. They found numerical solutions using a boundary integral equation applied to both harmonic functions in the Almansi biharmonic representation. The motion of the free surface, with or without surface tension, was modeled by a simple time-stepping routine. The numerical scheme accurately represented the free surface up to and beyond the point of overturning, revealing various wave profiles and flow patterns.
