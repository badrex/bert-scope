tldr: The author investigates the persistence and characteristics of luminosity in electric discharges in various gases and vapors. They observe that the luminosity can persist after the current has ceased and study the duration and intensity of the afterglow in different conditions. The author also examines the spectra of the luminosity and finds that the metallic glows have distinct line spectra, which can help in understanding the underlying mechanisms of the luminosity.
