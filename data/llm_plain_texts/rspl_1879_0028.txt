tldr: The author presents a graphical method to determine the secular effects of tidal friction on planetary satellites. They analyze the energy and moment of momentum of a system consisting of a planet and its satellite, considering various interactions and configurations. The study provides insights into the evolution of planetary systems and the possibility that celestial bodies may have once formed part of a single entity.
