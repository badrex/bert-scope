tldr: This article discusses the fibrinolytic activation mechanism in human plasma, focusing on the triggered enzyme systems and their interactions with plasma proteins. The author highlights the formation of inhibitor complexes, the role of molecular size and concentration-dependent inhibition, and the significance of these effects on the interpretation of fibrinolytic enzyme activity and the proactivator reaction.
