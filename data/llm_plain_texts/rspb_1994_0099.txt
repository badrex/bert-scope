tldr: This study investigates the effects of population density experienced by parents during mating and oviposition on the phase of hatchling desert locusts. The results show that crowding during oviposition causes females to produce offspring with gregarious behavior, while isolating crowd-reared females leads to more solitarious behavior. These findings demonstrate the flexibility of maternal effects in response to changes in population density.
