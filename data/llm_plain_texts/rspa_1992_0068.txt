tldr: This article examines the accumulation rates of spiral-like structures in fluid flows, focusing on turbulent jets, developing mixing layers, and smoke rings. The study aims to determine the behavior of these structures and their potential implications for understanding the characteristics of high-Reynolds-number shear flows. The authors find that the spiral-like structures possess only a few turns and are better modeled by a logarithmic spiral rather than a power-law spiral, which does not significantly contribute to the measured dimensions of iso-scalar contours in fully turbulent flows.
