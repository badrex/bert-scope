tldr: The author proposes a theory explaining the selective photoelectric effect by examining the surface layers of a metal. They suggest that a chemical compound forms between the metal and a more electronegative element, followed by a layer of a strongly electropositive element. This creates a potential barrier that affects the direction and energy of the emitted electrons, leading to selective properties in the photoelectric effect.
