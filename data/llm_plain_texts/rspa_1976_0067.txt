tldr: The article presents a rigorous proof of convergence for a perturbation series in the case of a Newtonian fluid, providing a rigorous existence theorem for a free surface problem in the theory of viscous fluids. The study considers a container of fluid with a rod inserted in the center, which rotates, causing the fluid surface to form a curved surface. The research focuses on the mathematical aspects of the problem, including domain perturbations, boundary value problems, and elliptic partial differential equations.
