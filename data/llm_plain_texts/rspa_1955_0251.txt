tldr: 'This study investigates the homogeneity of explosions initiated by flash photolysis, focusing on the presence of detonation waves in the reaction. The authors use photoelectric methods to analyze the light emitted from flash-initiated explosions of acetylene and oxygen, photo-sensitized by nitrogen dioxide. They find that while the main part of the explosion is homogeneous, two detonation waves travel short distances to the ends of the reaction vessel, impacting the vessel windows and causing intense emission peaks. The experiments demonstrate how easily detonation waves can be established in an explosive system, even with a large and uniform concentration of reaction centers.'
