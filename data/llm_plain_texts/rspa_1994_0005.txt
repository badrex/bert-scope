tldr: This paper presents an exact solution for the steady-state harmonic response of an elastic fluid-loaded membrane supported by irregularly spaced ribs. The solution is given under the assumption of subsonic wave coupling and explains the two distinct localization regimes: smooth and fluctuating exponential decay. The transfer matrix solution is used to explain these regions and the average transfer matrix is obtained exactly.
