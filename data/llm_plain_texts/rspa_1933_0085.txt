tldr: The author presents an elementary theory of electronic semi-conductors and their properties, discussing models of semi-conductors and their potential applications. The theory explains the behavior of electrons and holes in semi-conductors, and how it relates to the Hall effect and thermoelectric power. The author also explores the differences between intrinsic and extrinsic semi-conductors, and how impurities affect their conductivity.
