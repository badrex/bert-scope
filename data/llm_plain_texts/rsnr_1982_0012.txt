tldr: John Bevis was a prominent astronomer and Fellow of the Royal Society in the 18th century. He conducted numerous astronomical observations and contributed important data to the understanding of the solar system and the motions of the moon and planets. Bevis collaborated with telescope makers and observed with various instruments, including those of his friend and fellow astronomer Edmond Halley. He also worked on a star atlas, the Uranographia Britannica, which unfortunately remained unpublished due to the bankruptcy of his publisher.
