tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the factors controlling the rates of corrosion of zinc and mild steel. They found that the rate of oxygen supply to the metal surface is the main factor controlling corrosion, with other factors like the formation of protective films and the evolution of hydrogen playing a role in specific conditions. The authors also studied the distribution of corrosion and its relation to differential aeration, concluding that this principle is not the sole deciding factor in corrosion distribution.
