revised_title: Electrolysis Phenomena and the Relationship between Physical Properties of Metals
semantic_tags:
  - Electrolysis
  - Thermoelectricity
  - Physical properties of metals
  - Thomson effect
  - Metal deposition
tldr: The author observed new phenomena of electrolysis and found that the cathode with the same kind of metal being deposited tends to receive a deposit more readily. They also examined the relationship between the coefficient of the Thomson effect and other physical properties of metals, discovering a connection between these properties and the specific resistance, specific heat, and coefficient of expansion of metals.
