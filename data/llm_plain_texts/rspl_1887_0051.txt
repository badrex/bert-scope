tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the distribution of micro-organisms in the air and how it changes with temperature and environment. They found that the number of micro-organisms in the air generally follows the temperature, with the highest numbers present during hot summer months. The study also showed that the number of micro-organisms in the air is significantly affected by whether the environment is disturbed or not, with crowded rooms and busy outdoor areas having higher concentrations.
