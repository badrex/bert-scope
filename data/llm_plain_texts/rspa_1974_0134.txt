tldr: The authors studied the oxidation process of Nb12029, a mixed valence niobium oxide, using electron microscopy and electron diffraction. They discovered that the oxidation forms two new modifications of Nb205 through a series of structural transformations. The study provides insights into the low-temperature oxidation process and the role of oxygen diffusion in the reaction.
