tldr: This article discusses the origin and early evolution of galaxies, focusing on the first million years of the universe's life. It explores various classical and quantum processes that might shape the irregularity spectrum on large cosmic scales and examines the likely fate of adiabatic, isothermal, and vortical fluctuations in a hot, big-bang universe. The article also reviews different physical processes operating during the first million years and their potential impact on the irregularity spectrum emerging at the recombination era.
