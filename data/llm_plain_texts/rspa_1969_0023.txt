tldr: This study measures the temperature profile in a slow burning, flat-oxygen flame at atmospheric pressure using a thermocouple probe and an optical method. The optical method measures the deflection of light rays passing through the flame, while the thermocouple method provides a point-wise temperature profile. The results show some discrepancy between the two methods, leading to the conclusion that fine thermocouples are not reliable for precise temperature profile measurement in flames at atmospheric pressure.
