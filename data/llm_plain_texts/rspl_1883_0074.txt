tldr: 'The authors conducted a magnetic survey on the West Coast of Scotland to investigate the irregularities in magnetic inclination. They confirmed the existence of a local attraction area in Mull, caused by volcanic activity, and determined its influence on the dipping needle. The results showed that the area's effect was limited to a few miles around the island, and the normal direction of the isoclinal line would not be significantly affected.'
