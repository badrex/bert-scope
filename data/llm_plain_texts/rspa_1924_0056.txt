tldr: The authors conducted an experimental study to determine the viscosity of water vapour using a capillary viscometer. They found that the viscosity of water vapour is independent of pressure and provided a method to calculate the effective value of viscosity using the transpiration formula. The results showed that the values of viscosity obtained were consistent with previous findings.
