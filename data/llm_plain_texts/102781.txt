tldr: The author, Abr. de la Pryme, describes the discovery of numerous petrified shellfish in quarries in Broughton, Lincolnshire. He argues that these fossils, along with other geological evidence, support the existence of the Noachian Deluge, a catastrophic flood that wiped out the Antidiluvian World. The author also discusses the different types of soils and environments in which various shellfish species thrive.
