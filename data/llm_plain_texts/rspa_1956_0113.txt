tldr: The oxidation of aluminum in dry and humid oxygen atmospheres was studied, focusing on film growth and mechanisms. The research used single-crystal aluminum samples and employed a new electrometric method to analyze film growth. The findings showed that film growth in dry oxygen is initially rapid and then slows down, while in humid oxygen, film growth continues at a slower rate. The growth laws and parameters were determined for both conditions, and the structure of the air-formed films was examined.
