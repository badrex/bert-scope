tldr: 'Sir William Ramsay corrects previous calculations of the percentages of inactive gases in the atmosphere, specifically krypton and xenon. He found that the total weights calculated from the volumes were ten times too small and provided the corrected percentages. This correction also applies to the calculations of helium and neon in the atmosphere.'
