tldr: 'This article presents a method to improve atomic structure calculations by including exchange effects in the self-consistent field method. The authors apply this method to beryllium and find that exchange effects significantly improve the accuracy of the calculations. This work lays the foundation for more accurate atomic structure predictions and a better understanding of atomic behavior.'
