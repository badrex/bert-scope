tldr: The authors study the ciliated groove (siphonoglyphe) in the stomodaeum of alcyonarians, a group of marine invertebrates. They find that this groove, lined with long cilia, has important morphological relations in the group. The authors also propose a new classification system for alcyonarians based on their findings, dividing them into five principal groups.
