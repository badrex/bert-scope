tldr: The author conducted experiments on amphibian embryos, exposing them to various environmental stressors such as sugar solutions and reduced air pressure. The results showed that these stressors led to developmental abnormalities in the embryos, including swollen body cavities and bent tails. The author suggests that these abnormalities may be due to the effects of environmental disturbances on the embryos' development.
