tldr: This article discusses the petrology and evolution of the Troodos Massif in Cyprus, an ophiolite complex that resembles the rock suite found on the ocean floor. The authors argue that the Troodos Massif represents a slice of oceanic crust and uppermost mantle, formed through sea-floor spreading. They analyze the complex's three main units: Pillow Lava, Sheeted Complex, and Plutonic Complex, and provide evidence for their origin and geological significance.
