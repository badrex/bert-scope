tldr: The authors describe the analysis of a meteorite found in Makariwa, near Invercargill, New Zealand. The meteorite is composed of an intimate admixture of metallic matter (nickel-iron) and stony material. The specific gravity of portions of the stone varies due to the unequal distribution of metallic particles. A partial chemical examination was conducted, and the complete analysis will be communicated to the society.
