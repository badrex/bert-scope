tldr: The authors studied the rates of polymerization in a three-component system of styrene, p-methoxy-styrene, and methyl methacrylate. They used the radioactive initiator technique to determine the rate of initiation and found that the experimental rates were in good agreement with the calculated rates from the data of the relevant one- and two-component systems. The study provides insights into the composition of terpolymers and the overall rate of polymerization in such systems.
