tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the effects of acid, alkali, and certain indicators on the development of fish (Pleuronectes platessa) and sea urchin (Echinus esculentus) eggs. The results showed that eggs become more resistant to unfavorable environmental conditions as they age. Acid disturbances were more fatal than alkali, and different indicators had varying effects on the development of the two organisms. The study provides insights into the tolerance limits of eggs to changes in pH and the importance of environmental factors in their development.
