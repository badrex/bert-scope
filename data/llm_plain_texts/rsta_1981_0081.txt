tldr: This article discusses the experimental behavior of plasma instabilities in high-current discharges and compares it with the predictions of magnetohydrodynamic theory. The study focuses on two types of instabilities: ideal magnetohydrodynamic perturbations and resistive instabilities. The authors find that the properties of growing perturbations can be predicted by theory to within the accuracy of experiment. They also observe self-control mechanisms in the plasmas, which are related to the relaxation of configurations to states of lower magnetic energy.
