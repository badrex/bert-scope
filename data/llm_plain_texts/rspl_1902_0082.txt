tldr: The author investigates the stability of pear-shaped figures of equilibrium in rotating liquid masses. They use mathematical formulas and approximations to determine the conditions under which the pear-shaped figure is stable or unstable. The study has implications for understanding the behavior of celestial bodies like planets and moons.
