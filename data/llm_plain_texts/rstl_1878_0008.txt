tldr: The authors conducted experiments on electric discharges using the chloride of silver battery and vacuum tubes. They studied the discharge in rarefied gases and observed the beautiful stratification phenomenon. The authors also discussed the challenges they faced during their research, such as the permanent change in the tubes and the need for precise measurements and conditions. Their work contributed to the understanding of the electric discharge and its effects on gases.
