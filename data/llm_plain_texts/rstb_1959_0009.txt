tldr: This study investigates the effects of different environmental temperatures on the growth in weight and tail length of inbred and hybrid mice. The results show that growth in both weight and tail length is influenced by environmental temperature, with higher temperatures leading to faster growth. The magnitude of the response depends on the animal's genotype and maternal environment. Heterozygous animals, or hybrids, generally have a greater developmental flexibility and a smaller variability in both environments, indicating a higher level of homeostasis.
