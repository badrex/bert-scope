tldr: The authors use moiré fringes to analyze defects in zinc sulphide crystals. They find that the closure failure of a Burgers circuit in the distorted lattice is related to the closure failure of the corresponding circuit in moiré fringes. This correspondence is applied to determine the fault vectors of stacking faults and partial dislocations in wurtzite zinc sulphide crystals. The stacking faults on (0001) have fault vectors of the type a/3<10-10>, while stacking faults on prismatic planes have fault vectors of the type a<11-20>. The partial dislocations terminating stacking faults on (0001) are found to have a fault vector of a/3<10-10>.
