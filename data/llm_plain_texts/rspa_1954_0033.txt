tldr: The article discusses cloud chamber experiments to determine the mean lifetime and frequency of production of charged F-particles, which are believed to be heavy mesons similar to k- and y-mesons. The authors analyze the distribution of decay points and the relation between lifetime and frequency of production to estimate the mean lifetime of F-particles, concluding that it is less than 10^-8 seconds.
