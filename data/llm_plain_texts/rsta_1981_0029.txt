tldr: This article discusses various techniques used to obtain high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra from solid materials. These methods help remove the broadening effect of dipole-dipole coupling and reveal chemical shifts, exchange interactions, and interaction tensor components. Techniques mentioned include rapid spinning, multiple pulse experiments, multiple-quantum spectra, and cross-polarization. The article reviews these methods, their limitations, and provides examples of their applications in various solid materials.
