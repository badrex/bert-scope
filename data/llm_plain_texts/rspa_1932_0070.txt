tldr: The authors conducted a rotational analysis of the first positive bands of nitrogen using a powerful discharge in pure nitrogen. They observed nine strong branches and determined the molecular constants of the molecule in the initial and final states. The study provides insights into the quantum mechanics and molecular spectroscopy of nitrogen.
