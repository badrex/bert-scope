tldr: The authors investigated the kinetics of the formation of polysulphones from cis- and trans-2-butene. They found that both reactions show the "ceiling temperature" effect and determined the changes in entropy and heat content accompanying the reaction. The authors also discussed possible stereoisomerism of the polymer chains, which might account for the discrepancy in the results.
