tldr: The article discusses three models that explain how dominance might gradually evolve by natural selection in genetics. These models include Fisher's model, Parsons & Bodmer's model, and Sheppard's model. The evolution of dominance depends on the genetic variance in the fitness of the heterozygote and the mutation rate of the wild-type. Dominance can evolve through various mechanisms, such as the selection of a mutant heterozygote with a general genetic variance in its fitness or the spread of an advantageous gene through a population.
