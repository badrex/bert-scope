tldr: Researchers isolated and characterized poly-α-L-glutamic acid from the oviduct of domestic fowls. This substance was found to preserve the motility of cock sperm for several hours in vitro at the bird's body temperature. The molecular weight of the poly-α-L-glutamic acid was determined to be 73,600 by specific viscosity and 81,600 by end group analysis.
