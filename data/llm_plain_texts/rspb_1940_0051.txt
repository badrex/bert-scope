tldr: The article investigates the oestrogenic activity of 4:4'-dihydroxydiphenylmethane derivatives and their molecular structure. The authors found that the activity varies in homologous series, and the presence of certain groups, such as nuclear methyl groups, can significantly affect the potency. The study provides insights into the relationship between molecular structure and oestrogenic activity, which can be useful for developing synthetic oestrogens.
