tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the nature of radiant heating effects from various sources, such as flames and incandescent metals. They discovered that the heat radiated from luminous hot bodies is divided into two portions by a glass screen. One portion is stopped by the screen, while the other passes through without raising its temperature. The author also found that the non-transmissible portion of heat is absorbed more readily by blackened surfaces, while the transmissible portion is nearly equally absorbed by black and white surfaces.
