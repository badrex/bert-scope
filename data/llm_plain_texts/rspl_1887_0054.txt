tldr: Sir Richard Owen examines additional fossil remains of Meiolania platyceps from Lord Howe's Island and concludes that the extinct genera Megalania and Meiolania are more closely related to the Saurian division of the class Reptilia. He proposes to refer these genera to a sub-order called Ceratosauria.
