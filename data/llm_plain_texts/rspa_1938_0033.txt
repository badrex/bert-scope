tldr: This article investigates the micellar structure of stretched rubber and the effect of "higher orientation" on its properties. The authors propose a new model of micelle structure that is intermediate between two previously proposed theories. The micelles are lath-shaped and possess individuality, even though the "Hauptvalenzketten" themselves extend beyond the sphere of single micelles.
