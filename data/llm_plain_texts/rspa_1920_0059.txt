tldr: The authors studied the absorption of light and vapor density of various elements in their gaseous state, including selenium, tellurium, mercury, zinc, cadmium, phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony. They found that the elements' behavior and molecular complexity change with temperature, and their absorption spectra provide valuable information about their molecular constitution.
