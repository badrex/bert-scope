tldr: The author, Henry Kater, discovered that the thickness of the bar on which linear measures are traced can cause errors in measurement standards. He found that the error arises from the bar's flexure when placed on a curved surface. Kater developed a method to reduce this error by adjusting the bar's thickness and provided experimental proof of its effectiveness.
