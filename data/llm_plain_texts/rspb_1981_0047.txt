tldr: This study investigates the evoked response in the torus semicircularis of frogs to acoustic stimulation. The amplitude of the potential is maximal when the recording electrode is placed 1 mm below the tectal surface. The research shows that responses are evoked by tones over the frequency range of 50 to 3500 Hz, and the upper frequency limit can be extended beyond 5000 Hz by mechanical vibration of the middle ear. The projection from lower centers to the torus semicircularis is organized tonotopically, and maximum response is evoked from each region in the torus semicircularis by incident sound from a particular direction, creating a map of auditory space in the midbrain.
