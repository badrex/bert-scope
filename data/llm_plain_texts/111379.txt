tldr: The author presents a train-signalling system that allows disabled trains to telegraph for assistance without portable apparatus. The system uses large electro-magnets, bells, and a simple language of blows to communicate train signals. This system was introduced on the South Eastern Railway and has since improved railway safety and communication.
