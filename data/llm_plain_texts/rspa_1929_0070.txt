revised_title: 'Vacuum Distillation Techniques and Their Impact on Petroleum Derivatives'
semantic_tags:
  - Vacuum distillation
  - Petroleum derivatives
  - Organic substances
  - Condensation pumps
  - High-vacuum systems
tldr: The authors describe a method of vacuum distillation for organic substances, focusing on petroleum and its derivatives. They demonstrate that high molecular weight compounds can be fractionated without decomposition, and discuss the use of vacuum distillation in producing low-vapor-pressure oils and greases for high-vacuum systems. The authors also analyze the performance of a condensation pump in achieving the necessary vacuum for these distillations.
