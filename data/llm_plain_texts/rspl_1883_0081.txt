tldr: The author discovered a plant-based alternative to animal rennet in the seeds of Withania coagulans. An extract from the seeds, when mixed with milk, coagulates it and forms a cheese-like curd. This plant-based alternative could be a sustainable solution for cheese-making in India, where animal rennet is unsuitable for local consumption.
