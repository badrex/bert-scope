tldr: Cecil Henry Desch was a prominent metallurgist and surveyor who made significant contributions to the study of metals and their alloys. He authored the widely appreciated "Textbook of Metallography," which helped shape scientific metallurgy. Desch also had a deep interest in the French language and dialects, which led to his recognition in French scientific circles and his election as a corresponding member of the French Academy of Sciences in 1947.
