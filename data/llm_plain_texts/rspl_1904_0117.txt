semantic_tags:
  - Infinite Series

  - Approximation Theory
  - Convergence
tldr: The authors discuss the convergence of infinite series of analytic functions and present a theorem to approximate solutions for large values of the arguments. They demonstrate the application of this theorem to various functions and equations in analysis, including Lame's equation, and discuss the conditions for convergence of the series.
