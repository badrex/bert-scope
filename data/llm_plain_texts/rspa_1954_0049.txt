tldr: The author extends the theory of aerodynamically generated sound by considering the statistical properties of turbulent airflows, leading to the concept of aerodynamic noise. The study focuses on the noise produced by jets, comparing the theory with experimental data. The results show that the acoustic power output varies with jet velocity, and the sound spectrum is broad, with a peak frequency near the jet's velocity and diameter. Most of the sound is radiated in directions making an acute angle with the jet, with higher frequency sound emitted mainly from near the orifice and lower frequency sound from farther downstream.
