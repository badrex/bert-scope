tldr: The study investigates the shell growth patterns and tidal bands in the clam Tapes philippinarum under various environmental conditions. The clams laid down weak micro-growth bands under constant conditions, but stronger bands during periodic aerial emersion. The results suggest that an endogenous circa-tidal rhythm of shell deposition can be entrained by periods of tidal emersion.
