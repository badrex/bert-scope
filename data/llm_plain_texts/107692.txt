tldr: Humphry Davy examines the state of water and aeriform matter within cavities found in certain crystals. He discovers that the fluid inside these crystals is mostly water with a small amount of alkaline sulfates, and the gas is primarily nitrogen. The experiments provide evidence that these crystals were formed at a higher temperature than the current surface of the Earth, suggesting that the formation of crystals is linked to the Earth's past temperature conditions.
