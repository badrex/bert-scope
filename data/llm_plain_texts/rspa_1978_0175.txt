tldr: This article investigates the interaction of oxygen and nitric oxide with aluminium surfaces using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The study focuses on the temperature range of 80-290 K and explores the electronic environment of aluminium and oxygen atoms during interaction. The results provide insights into the chemisorption of oxygen and nitric oxide, the conditions for molecular dissociation, and the fate of the resulting adatoms.
