tldr: The authors conducted experiments on single crystal rods of tin to study the nature and characteristics of the yield point. They discovered a type of plasticity below the point usually considered as the yield point, which they called "micro-plasticity." The study provides insights into the properties of the metallic state and the behavior of tin crystals under stress.
