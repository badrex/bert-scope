tldr: In this lecture, Augustus Waller discusses his method of investigating the nervous system, focusing on the functions of the pneumogastric and sympathetic nerves. He explains the importance of understanding the nervous system's role in various bodily functions and describes his experiments on the vagus nerve, which supplies and controls important organs such as the heart, lungs, and stomach. Waller also explores the effects of nerve irritation on the body and suggests using mechanical irritation as an alternative to anesthetics during certain surgical procedures.
