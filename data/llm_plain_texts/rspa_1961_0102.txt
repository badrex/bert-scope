tldr: The authors conducted a study on the disintegrations produced by the capture of at-rest K^- mesons, focusing on the emission of fast charged 27-hyperons. They analyzed 63 events and found that six were due to absorption in carbon, nitrogen, or oxygen without emitting any neutrons, while eight were consistent with capture by a light nucleus with the emission of one neutron. The results provide evidence for a significant contribution from capture by light nuclei.
