tldr: The author examines the organization and structure of fossil plants from the coal measures, specifically Heterangium Tiliceoides and Kaloxylon Hookeri. They describe the unique features of these plants, including their vascular systems, cortical layers, and lateral outgrowths. The author also discusses the possible evolutionary relationships between these plants and modern-day cycads and ferns.
