tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments to determine the lifetimes of excited neon atoms. They found that the measured values of the lifetimes should be increased by the amount of the lag in the Kerr effect. The results provide insights into the behavior of neon atoms in liquids with large molecules and high viscosity.'
