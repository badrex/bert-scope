tldr: The authors present a mathematical model for analyzing tides in oceans bounded by meridians. They use complex harmonic motion and transform the fundamental differential equations into a series of algebraic equations with numerical coefficients. This study focuses on an ocean of uniform depth and aims to provide numerical results for various tidal constituents.
