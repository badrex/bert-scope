tldr: This study investigates the relationship between pigmentation abnormalities and inner ear issues in various mammals, including humans. The research found that inner ear abnormalities were present in all heavily spotted genotypes, and the severity and extent of these abnormalities were more closely related to internal pigmentation than external spotting. The findings support the hypothesis that the neural crest might be the link between the two components of the syndrome, and the study also explains why the two components sometimes appear to be separated.
