tldr: 'This article discusses the fate of nitrogen applied to agricultural crops, particularly focusing on denitrification. It highlights how adverse environmental conditions and cultivation methods can affect the efficiency of nitrogen fertilizer utilization. The study also examines the impact of different cultivation techniques on the absorption of fertilizer nitrogen and the role of soil-derived nitrogen in crop growth.'
