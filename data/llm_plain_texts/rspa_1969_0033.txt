tldr: This study investigates the adsorption of oxygen on tungsten ribbons and identifies three surface states with distinct properties. The authors determine coverage and sticking probabilities using the flow technique and measure surface potentials through thermionic emission. Their findings contribute to understanding the chemisorption mechanisms and surface states of tungsten oxides.
