tldr: The authors developed a new method to estimate metabolism and tested its effectiveness using ultra-violet radiation on mice, rats, and human subjects. They found that the radiation had varying effects on metabolism, with some subjects experiencing a rise while others showed no significant change. The study also compared the results of using different light sources and analyzed the impact of various factors on the experiments.
