tldr: The author studies the structure and adaptations of the Tellinacea, a group of eulamellibranchs that feed on bottom deposits. They examine various British species, focusing on the Tellinidae and Macoma balthica, and discuss the unique features of their siphons, foot, ctenidia, and alimentary canal. The Tellinacea have evolved specialized structures to efficiently feed on bottom deposits and thrive in diverse environments.
