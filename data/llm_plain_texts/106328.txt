tldr: The article discusses observations on the limits of algebraic equations and a general demonstration of Des Cartes' rule for finding the number of positive and negative roots. It examines the limitations of previous methods and presents a new approach to determine the roots of equations, which can be applied to various types of equations, including cubics and biquadratics.
