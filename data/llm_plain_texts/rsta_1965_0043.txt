tldr: This symposium discusses the evidence and mechanisms behind continental drift. Most speakers interpret their results in terms of movement of the continents, but there is disagreement about the interpretation of past plant and animal distribution. The most plausible theory for continental movement is the hypothesis of convection currents within the Earth's mantle. However, there are difficulties in explaining this movement, such as the difference between the observed and hydrostatic ellipticity of the geoid and the distribution of heat flow. Despite these challenges, the author suggests that the facts of observation should guide our understanding of continental drift.
