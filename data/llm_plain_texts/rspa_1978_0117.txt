tldr: This article examines the development of the excitation of a transition between two atomic or molecular energy levels under the influence of monochromatic laser radiation, focusing on conditions of inhomogeneous line broadening and mixed inhomogeneous-homogeneous broadening. The author calculates the ratio of the number of molecules in an excited state to the total number for various ratios of the intensity parameter to the half line-width, providing numerical results and discussing the oscillatory behavior and steady-state values of the excitation process.
