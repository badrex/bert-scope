tldr: The authors developed a theory to calculate the dipole polarizabilities and shielding factors of atoms or ions in the lithium isoelectronic sequence. They used an expansion method based on the exactly soluble unperturbed Hamiltonian and applied it to the lithium isoelectronic sequence. The results were found to be in agreement with earlier work.
