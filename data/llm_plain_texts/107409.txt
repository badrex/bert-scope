tldr: The author, William Thomas Brande, conducted experiments to study the effects of magnesia on preventing the formation of uric acid and its influence on urine composition. He found that magnesia was effective in treating cases where alkalies had failed and improved the overall health of the urinary system. The author also discussed the importance of using acids in treating cases of white sand (ammoniaco-magnesian phosphate) deposits in the urine.
