tldr: The authors study the high orders of asymptotic expansions in a large parameter for contour integrals involving a cluster of coalescing saddles. They establish the form of the divergence of the expansions and describe the crossover between different forms using canonical integrals and cuspoid catastrophe polynomials from singularity theory. The authors also obtain a new exact formula for the coefficients in the uniform expansion.
