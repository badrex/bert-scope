tldr: The authors measured the cross section for the production of metastable helium ions through electron impact excitation. They used a crossed beams technique and a sensitive detector to measure the cross section over the energy range of 0 to 1000 eV. The results were compared with theoretical calculations and showed good agreement with the plane-wave Born approximation. This study provides valuable data for understanding electron impact excitation in atomic and ion physics.
