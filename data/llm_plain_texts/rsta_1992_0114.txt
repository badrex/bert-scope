tldr: This article investigates the growth of metastable corrosion pits on stainless steel immersed in chloride solution and their transition to stability. The rate of growth is controlled by the diffusion of dissolving metal cations from the pit interior. A critical value of the pit stability product is identified, below which the pit is metastable and may repassivate, and above which the pit is stable. The importance of metastable pits lies in the information they provide about the formation of stable, destructive pits.
