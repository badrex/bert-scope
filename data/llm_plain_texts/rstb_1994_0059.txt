tldr: The article describes the structure and organization of the anterior central nervous system in amphioxus larvae, focusing on the cerebral vesicle and its potential landmarks for comparing amphioxus with other chordates. The study identifies the frontal eye and the lamellar body as ciliary photoreceptors, suggesting their possible evolutionary significance and potential homology with vertebrate eyes. The findings contribute to the understanding of vertebrate origins and the development of the central nervous system.
