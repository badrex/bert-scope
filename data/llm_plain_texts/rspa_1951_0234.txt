tldr: The authors studied the thermal decomposition of barium azide and the effects of pre-irradiation on the process. They proposed a mechanism for nucleus formation and growth involving the production of positive holes and excitons, as well as the role of anion vacancies and electron transfer in the decomposition process. The activation energy for the growth of small nuclei was found to be higher than that for the growth of visible-sized nuclei.
