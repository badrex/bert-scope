tldr: The author, G. W. Royston-Pigott, developed the Aplanatic Searcher to improve the performance of microscopes by enhancing penetration, magnifying power, and definition. The Aplanatic Searcher corrects for optical aberrations and allows for better comparison between known and unknown objects. It increases the power of the microscope and improves focal depth, making it possible to observe objects through thicker glass.
