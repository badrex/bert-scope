tldr: This article discusses the biochemical functions of carotenoids in plants, specifically their roles in photosynthesis. Carotenoids serve as accessory light-harvesting pigments, extending the range of wavelengths that can drive photosynthesis, and protect chlorophyllous pigments from photodestructive reactions. The author presents evidence on how carotenoids are organized within the photosynthetic unit and how they discharge their functions through singlet-singlet and triplet-triplet energy transfers.
