tldr: The author, Everard Home, describes a case study where he treated an aneurismal tumor by applying heat to the blood within the tumor using a heated needle. The treatment was successful in stopping the pulsation and solidifying the blood, but the patient eventually died due to complications. The author also discusses experiments on the effects of temperature on blood coagulation and the appearance of blood under different conditions.
