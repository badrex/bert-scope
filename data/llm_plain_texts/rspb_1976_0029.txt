tldr: 'This study investigates the effects of prolonged exposure to low-intensity light on the Norway lobster's photoreceptors. The visual pigment of the Norway lobster was found to change into a long-lived photoproduct upon exposure to light, causing the structural stability of the rhabdoms to degrade. The researchers discovered that even a short exposure to light could cause complete rhabdom degeneration within 24 hours, suggesting that this type of degeneration might be induced in other "dim light" species with low rates of pigment regeneration.'
