tldr: Mr. Kirkby reports on an inland sea near Danzick that turns green during dry weather, causing the death of animals and birds that consume it. He also mentions the discovery of a large piece of white amber in the sea, which supports the idea that amber is a bituminous fluid substance hardened by the operations of aqua-aerial particles.
