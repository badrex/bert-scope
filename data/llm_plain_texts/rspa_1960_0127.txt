tldr: The article discusses the response of glaciers and ice-sheets to seasonal and climatic changes. It presents a mathematical model to analyze the effects of these changes on the behavior of glaciers and ice-sheets. The model considers factors such as the rate of accumulation, melting, and the interaction between the direct and delayed response of the glacier to changes in climate.
