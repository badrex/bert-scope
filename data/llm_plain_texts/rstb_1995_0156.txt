tldr: 'This article explores the factors that determine the sex of germ cells in vertebrates. It shows that the decision to develop as eggs or sperm depends on the tissue environment rather than the sex chromosome constitution of the cells. The male genital ridge produces an inhibitor of meiosis, causing germ cells to develop as prospermatogonia, while the female genital ridge allows germ cells to enter meiosis and develop as oocytes. The role of the Y chromosome and X-chromosome inactivation in germ cell differentiation is also discussed.'
