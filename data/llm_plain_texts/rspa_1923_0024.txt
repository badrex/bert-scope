tldr: 'The author examines the iridescent colors and structure of potassium chlorate crystals, discovering that the colors result from multiple reflecting surfaces in the form of twin planes. Using polarized light and microscopy, the author provides detailed observations and analysis of the crystal structure and its relation to the colors produced.'
