revised_title: 'Structural Determinants of Permeability in Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Channels'
semantic_tags:
  - Ion permeation
  - Channel conductance
  - Amino acid mutations
  - Neurotransmitter receptors
  - Pore size
tldr: The authors studied the effects of pore size and negative charge on the permeability of the Torpedo nicotinic acetylcholine receptor channel. They found that both the size and net charge of amino acid residues in the intermediate ring play a crucial role in determining permeability. The results provide evidence that pore size at the intermediate ring is a critical determinant of permeability and suggest that changes in net charge affect permeability by altering pore size.
