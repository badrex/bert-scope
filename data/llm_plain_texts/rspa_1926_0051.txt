revised_title: 'Relativity Theory of Light and Plane Waves'
semantic_tags:
  - Relativity Theory
  - Electromagnetic Waves
  - Gravitational Waves
  - Wave Propagation
  - Divergent Waves
tldr: The authors explore the relativity theory of plane waves, specifically focusing on the propagation of electromagnetic and gravitational waves. They discover that infinite plane waves cannot be propagated without change of the wave-form, and that the relativity theory of light must be approached through the study of divergent waves.
