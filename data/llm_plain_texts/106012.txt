tldr: The author, John Swinton, examines a monogram on the reverse of an ancient Roman quinarius coin. He provides an explanation for the complex character, which he believes may help decipher other ancient Roman coins with similar legends. Swinton suggests that the monogram was borrowed from the Etruscans, with whom the Romans had a strong connection. He also discusses the use of monograms in various ancient cultures, such as the Hebrews, Phoenicians, and Greeks.
