tldr: The authors study the thermodynamics of the thermomechanical effect in liquid helium II, discovering that heat can be transformed into mechanical work through a process called the "thermomechanical effect." This phenomenon is closely related to thermoelectric effects and reveals a new mechanism for converting heat into work. The authors also discuss the possible role of helium's phase transition and the Bose-Einstein statistics in this process.
