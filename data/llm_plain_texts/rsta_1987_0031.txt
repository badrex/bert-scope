tldr: This article discusses the potential industrial applications of lignin-transforming enzymes, focusing on their use in the pulp and paper industry and pollution control. The enzymes can be used to replace chlorine-based oxidizing agents in pulp bleaching, reduce brightness reversion and increase mechanical pulp strength. Additionally, they can help in the degradation of pollutants such as dioxin and DDT, and enhance the utility of kraft lignin and lignosulphonates.
