tldr: This article describes an experiment to determine the velocity of ions produced in gases by Röntgen rays. The authors used an electric field and a beam of Röntgen rays to ionize a gas and measure the velocity of positive and negative ions separately. They found that the ionic velocity in a unit electric field is dependent on the mean velocity of the gas stream and the difference of potential between the cylinders. The results showed that the charges carried by positive and negative ions are equal and the same for different gases, similar to the charge carried by the hydrogen ion in the electrolysis of liquids.
