tldr: This study investigates the formation of standing waves on a vertical water film caused by an accelerating airstream. The research aims to understand the mechanism of flooding in a packed tower, which is used in the chemical industry for gas-liquid contact. The authors found that the formation of these waves is the initial step in the flooding of a packed tower, and their findings can help improve the design and operation of these systems.
