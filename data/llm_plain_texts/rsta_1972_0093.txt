tldr: This article presents an asymptotic theory for the long-period bodily tides in an Earth model with a liquid core. The authors find that the yielding inside the core is different for stable and unstable density stratification. They also clarify the Jeffreys-Vicente conjecture and provide Love numbers for various types of liquid cores. The study shows that a liquid core does not need to be in neutral equilibrium and that the displacements and stresses within a liquid core in tidal yielding are determinate.
