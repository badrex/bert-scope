tldr: The study investigates the effects of orchidectomy on tumor induction, tumor transplantation, and the occurrence of spontaneous leukemia in mice. Orchidectomy was found to prolong the interval between carcinogen injection and tumor appearance, decrease the number of tumors, and confer a protective effect against transplanted tumors. However, it increased the death rate from spontaneous leukemia. The protective effect of orchidectomy is suggested to be mediated through alteration of cell-mediated immunity and the thymus.
