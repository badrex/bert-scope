tldr: The author discovered a new mineral in Cyprus, which they named Cyprusit, due to its unique chemical composition and the presence of well-preserved siliceous shells of microscopic Radiolaria. The mineral is composed primarily of basic sulfate of oxide of iron and is found in large quantities on a hillside. The author also observed the process of efflorescence of salt in the area, which affects the growth of vegetation.
