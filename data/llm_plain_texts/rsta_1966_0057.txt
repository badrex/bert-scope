tldr: This article presents electron collision studies with trapped positive ions, focusing on the ionization and excitation of positive ions by electrons. The authors develop the theory of the trap and compare it with experimental results, providing cross section functions for the ionization of various ions and the dissociation of molecules by electrons. The study has potential applications in understanding and improving mass spectrometry techniques and furthering our knowledge of ionization processes.
