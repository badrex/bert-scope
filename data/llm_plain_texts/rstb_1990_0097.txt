tldr: The authors explore the relationship between circadian rhythms, performance efficiency, and safety in hazardous situations. They discuss how the endogenous body clock and exogenous factors, such as sleep and meal timing, influence performance over the course of a day. The study highlights the importance of understanding these rhythms to improve safety and productivity, especially for shift workers.
