semantic_tags:
  - Clathrate compounds

  - Statistical thermodynamics
  - Hydrates
  - Non-stoichiometry
tldr: The authors present a statistical thermodynamic interpretation of non-stoichiometric clathrate compounds of water, explaining the stabilizing action of 'hilfsgase' and various thermochemical properties. They also discuss the formation of clathrate phases and provide estimates of dissociation pressures and fractionation of mixtures.
