tldr: 'The article investigates the properties of endothelium related to capillary permeability using electron microscopy and introduces ferritin and saccharated iron oxide as electron-dense marker particles. The study examines the behavior of these particles in the endothelium of rat and mouse heart capillaries under various conditions, including different perfusion fluids and temperatures. The results show that particles enter caveolae and vesicles from the lumen, and some ferritin molecules seem to traverse the cell by the caveolae and vesicles. The study provides insights into the transport mechanisms of substances across the capillary wall.'
