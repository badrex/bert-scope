tldr: This article discusses a discussion meeting on the numerical analysis of partial differential equations (PDEs), an important and challenging field in applied mathematics. The meeting aimed to bring together experts and scientists interested in numerical methods to share their work and influence its future development. The article covers the three main theoretical areas of PDEs (hyperbolic, parabolic, and elliptic equations), linear and nonlinear equations, and the practical applications of solving specific physical problems.
