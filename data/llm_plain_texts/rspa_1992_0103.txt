tldr: The article discusses the behavior of elastic surface waves in monoclinic media, where the reference plane coincides with a plane of material symmetry. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the propagation of these waves, evaluating the necessary integrals and deriving an explicit formula connecting a fourth integral to the other three. They present illustrative numerical results for 12 monoclinic crystals, focusing on the transitions between subsonic and supersonic surface-wave propagation.
