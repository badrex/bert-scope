tldr: This study compares the effects of unidirectional and alternating strains on the crystalline structure of metals, specifically focusing on fatigue and standard changes. The research finds that alternating reversals of small strains do not significantly extend the regions in the grain disturbed by their first application, while larger strains cause more widespread fragmentation and disorientation. The findings have implications for understanding the mechanisms of fatigue and the localizing of deformation in metals.
