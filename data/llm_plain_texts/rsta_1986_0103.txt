tldr: This article explores the behavior of sound waves in nonlinear acoustic propagation over long distances. It discusses the geometrical and diffusive effects that occur in these situations, focusing on the breakdown of shock waves and the resulting loss of amplitude. The authors use Burgers' equation to model the phenomenon and analyze the matching conditions between lossless and nonlinear solutions.
