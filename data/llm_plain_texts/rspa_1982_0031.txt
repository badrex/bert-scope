tldr: The authors apply artificial viscosity to the transonic integral equation to obtain solutions with shocks. They demonstrate that the iterative scheme with the linear solution as the initial iterate leads to convergence. The method has advantages over other schemes, such as avoiding complex iterates and allowing the linear solution to be used as the initial iterate. The study includes tables showing how the solution varies with changes in the artificial viscosity term parameters.
