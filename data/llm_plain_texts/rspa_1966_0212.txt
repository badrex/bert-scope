tldr: The authors investigated the effects of X-irradiation on KCl:H and NaCl:H crystals at low temperatures using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. They discovered a new hydrogen atom center, called the center, in KCl:H and assigned it to hydrogen atoms in chlorine sites. The center was also observed in NaCl:H, but the system was not extensively studied. The authors discussed the EPR spectra, optical absorption, and formation and annealing mechanisms of the centers.
