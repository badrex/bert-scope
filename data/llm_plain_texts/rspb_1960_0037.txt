tldr: The author investigates the true identity of Tetraplatia, a mysterious marine organism, and concludes that it is a scyphomedusan. The study reveals that Tetraplatia has a unique growth pattern and evolutionary history, which sets it apart from other known species. The author suggests that Tetraplatia evolved from a coronate scyphomedusan with arrested radial expansion, leading to its distinct biconical shape and locomotory organs.
