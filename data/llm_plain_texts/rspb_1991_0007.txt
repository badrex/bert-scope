tldr: The study investigates the length of a single NMDA receptor activation using low glutamate concentrations in rat hippocampal slices. It shows that individual channel activations contain surprisingly long shut periods and very short interruptions. The results suggest that the slow decay of NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic currents may result mainly from the fact that individual channel activations are long.
