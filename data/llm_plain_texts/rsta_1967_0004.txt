tldr: The authors tested the mechanical properties of pure iron in compression over the temperature range of 2 to 293 K. They found that the flow stress and yield stress were independent of temperature below 10 K, and that macroscopic yielding and flow at low temperatures were governed by the same deformation mechanism. The results indicate that macroscopic deformation at low temperatures is controlled by lattice frictional stress (Peierls-Nabarro force) acting on dislocations.
