tldr: The authors studied the dopaminergic interplexiform cells in the goldfish retina and found that these cells make synapses of the conventional type. In the outer plexiform layer, they contacted external horizontal cells and bipolar cell dendrites but not photoreceptor terminals. In the inner plexiform layer, they were both pre- and postsynaptic to amacrine cells. The dopaminergic interplexiform cells provide a centrifugal pathway for information flow in the retina from the inner to the outer plexiform layer.
