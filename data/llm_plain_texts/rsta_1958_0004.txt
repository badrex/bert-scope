tldr: The authors conducted experiments on thermal convection in a rotating liquid, specifically water, to study its flow patterns and behavior. They discovered that when the liquid rotates uniformly around a vertical axis and is subject to a horizontal temperature gradient, the flow patterns can be influenced by Coriolis forces. The study of these flow patterns and their behavior has implications for understanding the general atmospheric circulation and the hydrodynamical flow in the Earth's liquid core.
