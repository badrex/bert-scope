tldr: The authors discovered that a system consisting of manganese carbonyl and a low concentration of carbon tetrachloride can efficiently initiate vinyl polymerization. They conducted a kinetic study of the photoinitiation mechanism using methyl methacrylate as the monomer. The main observations suggest that a primary product of the photolysis of the carbonyl forms an adduct with carbon tetrachloride, which may either dissociate into trichloromethyl radicals or be destroyed by reaction with another species. The quantum efficiency of initiation and the absorption spectrum of manganese carbonyl solutions were also studied.
