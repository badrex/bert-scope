tldr: This study examines the relationship between testosterone levels and mating success in black grouse, a lekking bird species. Researchers found that males with higher testosterone levels had more central territories and a stronger correlation with mating success. This suggests that the immunocompetence handicap hypothesis may play a significant role in this species, as high testosterone levels can reduce immunological resistance.
