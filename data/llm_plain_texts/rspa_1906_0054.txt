  - Alternating Currents
tldr: This article investigates the effects of self-induction in iron cylinders when electric currents are reversed and maintained steady. The author examines the magnetic fields and current densities within the cylinder using exploring coils and analyzes the results to understand the behavior of the magnetic force and the electric resistance in the iron cylinder. The study has implications for the use of alternating currents in electrical engineering and the design of railway rails.
