tldr: The authors developed a method called Druyvesteyn analysis to study electron energy distributions in plasmas, particularly in striated discharges. They found that the energy distribution usually takes the form of two well-separated groups of electrons, with a small third group in some cases. The high-energy group is generated by the potential difference across the striation head and becomes progressively attenuated towards its tail. This research helps to understand the energy exchange mechanism in plasmas and the conditions under which the electron energy distribution becomes Maxwellian.
