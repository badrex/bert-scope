tldr: A comparative study of seven avian defective leukemia viruses reveals that they transform cells by acquiring host cellular sequences. The viruses within the same biological grouping have acquired related sequences, indicating that viruses with similar cellular sequences have similar oncogenic capabilities. The transformed cells express gag-related fusion proteins, which have an amino-terminal region derived from the gag gene and a carboxy-terminal half derived from the cellular sequences. The ability of these viruses to transform cells and the target cell specificity of the transformation depends on these cellular sequences.
