tldr: The study investigates the transport of sucrose across Necturus gall bladder epithelium and the role of junctional water flow in this process. The researchers found that most of the sucrose flow across the junctions is convective in nature, and the size of the junctional water flow required amounts to most of the overall epithelial water flow. This challenges the standing-gradient osmosis theory and suggests that the junctional water flow may not be driven by osmosis.
