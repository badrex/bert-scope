tldr: This article discusses the equations of the Hartree and Hartree-Fock formulations for perturbed atomic systems. It presents two methods for solving these equations and provides a quantitative assessment of their accuracy by calculating the dipole and quadrupole polarizabilities of helium. The author also compares the two methods and their respective results, highlighting the advantages and limitations of each approach.
