tldr: The author presents a technique for obtaining asymptotic solutions of nonlinear Volterra integral equations using the analytic continuation and study of the pole diagram of the Mellin transform. This method provides simple and accurate solutions to problems in nonlinear heat conduction, boundary-layer heat transfer, and other fields, which were previously tackled by numerical methods. The technique is demonstrated through the solution of several example equations.
