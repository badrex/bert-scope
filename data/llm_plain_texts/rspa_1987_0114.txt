revised_title: 'Gravitational Collapse of Static Axisymmetric Discs and Cosmic Censorship'
semantic_tags:
  - Gravitational collapse
  - Cosmic censorship hypothesis
  - Einstein's field equations
  - Aspherical collapse
  - Static axisymmetric discs
tldr: The authors study the collapse of static axisymmetric discs using Einstein's field equations. They find that imposing the weak energy condition prevents the formation of a singularity and preserves the validity of the cosmic censorship hypothesis. The results also support the hoop conjecture in highly aspherical situations.
