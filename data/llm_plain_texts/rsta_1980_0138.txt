tldr: This article discusses non-convecting solar ponds, which use a salt gradient to suppress convection and create a stable, heated layer at the bottom. These ponds can collect solar energy over large areas with minimal energy transport losses, making them a potential solution for harnessing solar energy and addressing issues with traditional solar collectors. The article also explores the stability criteria, transmission of solar radiation, and methods of constructing and extracting energy from these ponds.
