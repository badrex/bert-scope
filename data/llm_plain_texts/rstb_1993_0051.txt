tldr: The article describes the oculomotor system of decapod cephalopods, focusing on the eye muscles, eye muscle nerves, and the oculomotor neurons in the central nervous system. It discusses the differences between the extraocular eye muscles of squid and cuttlefish and compares the eye muscle system of decapods and octopods. The study reveals the function of additional anterior and superior muscles for binocular vision and the presence of conjunctive muscles that cross the midline to move both eyes simultaneously. The article also highlights the trochlear cartilage and trochlear membrane's role in convergent eye movements.
