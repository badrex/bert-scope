tldr: This study investigates the anion permeation and selectivity in GABA- and glycine-gated chloride channels of cultured hippocampal neurons. The results show that anions with a diameter of about 4 Å have the highest permeability, while larger anions have lower permeabilities. The permeability sequence for both channels is SCN⁻ > NO₃⁻ > I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > Formate⁻ > Acetate⁻ > Bicarbonate⁻ > Gluconate⁻ > F⁻ > Phosphate⁻. The study also reveals that the concentration dependence and mole-fraction dependence of permeation are similar for both GABA- and glycine-gated channels.
