tldr: John Frederic Daniell conducted experiments with voltaic combinations to study the forces developed and the mutual relations between generating and conducting surfaces. He found that the force emanating from the zinc center diffuses equally over the conducting sphere and concluded that the law of radiant forces follows the inverse square law. The author also investigated the effect of distance and the role of electrolytes in the force's direction.
