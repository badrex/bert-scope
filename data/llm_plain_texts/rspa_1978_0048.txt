tldr: The authors observed and analyzed over 120 two-electron excitation resonances in neutral atomic zinc for the first time. They identified these resonances by comparing them with published Zn II energy levels and Hartree-Fock calculations. The study reveals strong electron correlation within the valence and subvalence subshells, and the findings support the importance of final state configuration mixing in two-electron excitation processes.
