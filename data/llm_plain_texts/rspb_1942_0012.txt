tldr: The authors study the process of antheridium dehiscence and the dispersal of spermatocytes in Bryophyta, particularly in Mnium hornum L. They find that surface tension plays a crucial role in the dispersal of spermatocytes, as the presence of fat in the spermatocyte mass lowers the surface tension and causes the spreading. This spreading action is essential for carrying spermatocytes rapidly to the female organ, where free sperms are liberated and directed chemotactically to the female gamete.
