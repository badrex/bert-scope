tldr: This article investigates the structures of Fe4N and Fe2N in the iron-nitrogen system. The authors prepare the iron nitride phase and study its crystal structure using X-ray diffraction. They find that the -phase has a face-centered cubic close-packing of iron atoms with nitrogen atoms occupying one-fourth of the number of octahedral interstices in a completely ordered manner. The -phase has a base-centered orthorhombic structure, formed by a small anisotropic distortion of the lattice when the nitrogen concentration exceeds 25%.
