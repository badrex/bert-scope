tldr: This article discusses the phenomenon of co-metabolism, where microorganisms transform non-growth substrates in the presence of a growth substrate or another transformable compound. The author proposes a new definition for co-metabolism and explains its importance in the biotransformation of organic pollutants and potential industrial applications. The article focuses on the biochemical basis of co-metabolism in methane-oxidizing bacteria, highlighting the role of methane monooxygenase in the oxidation of various compounds.
