tldr: The article describes the development and design of the selective chopper radiometer for the Nimbus 5 satellite, which measures atmospheric temperature from space. The improved instrument has 16 channels, allowing for better horizontal resolution and more accurate temperature measurements. The authors discuss the challenges and considerations in designing the instrument, including calibration, cloud detection, and water vapor measurements. The radiometer provides valuable data for understanding global atmospheric temperature distribution and studying stratospheric phenomena.
