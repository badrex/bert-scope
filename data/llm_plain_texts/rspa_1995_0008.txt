tldr: The authors discovered that a shear-induced transition to an ordered state occurs in simulations of condensed molecular systems, and positional ordering can persist even after shearing has stopped. They propose that this mechanism can be used as the basis for a computational technique to investigate the crystallization of molecular liquids.
