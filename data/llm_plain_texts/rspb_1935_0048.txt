tldr: The author investigates the internal mechanics of chromosomes during prophase in Fritillaria species. They discover that chromosome pairing begins near the spindle attachment and that the proximal parts of chromosomes pair first. The author also finds that pairing is incomplete in some species, leading to relational coiling and providing insight into chromosome mechanics.
