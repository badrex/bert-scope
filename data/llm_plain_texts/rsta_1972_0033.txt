tldr: This article discusses the evidence and causes of subsidence in southeastern England, focusing on the region's geological history and the role of plate tectonics. The authors explore the various factors that have contributed to the region's instability, including the Earth's crust movements and the influence of rifting and drifting of continents. They also examine the impact of these geological processes on the region's sedimentary rocks and the accumulation of various formations over time.
