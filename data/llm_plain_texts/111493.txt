tldr: The author, Sir Charles Lyell, examines the formation of continuous tabular masses of stony lava on steep slopes and discusses the mode of origin of Mount Etna. He also presents a theory of craters of elevation and investigates the physical changes that have occurred in the landscape of Mount Etna since his previous visit in 1828. Lyell's research includes the study of the lava fields, the structure of the volcano's nucleus, and the concept of two axes of eruption, which he calls the axis of Trifoglietto and the axis of Mongibello.
