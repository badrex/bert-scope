tldr: This article investigates the fatigue and ultimate tensile strengths of metals at different temperatures between 4-2 and 293 degrees Kelvin. The results show that the fatigue strength of most metals improves significantly at low temperatures, with some metals like aluminum showing a more marked temperature dependence. The ultimate tensile strength of the metals also increases at low temperatures, with a strong correlation between the increase in tensile strength and the increase in fatigue strength. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for the general problem of fatigue failure and the formation of micro-cracks in metals.
