tldr: The author investigates the development of the pericardium and kidneys in the oyster Ostrea edulis. They discovered that these organs originate from mesodermal cells, contradicting previous theories that suggested an ectodermal origin. The study provides a detailed description of the embryonic development and the formation of these organs in the oyster, contributing to the understanding of organogenesis in Mollusca.
