tldr: The author, J.J. Waterston, presents a general law of density in saturated vapours. He examines the relationship between pressure, temperature, and density of vapours in contact with their generating liquids. Using experiments from the French Academy, Waterston finds that the density of steam in contact with water follows a distinct law with reference to temperature. He also discusses the analogy between the law of increase of density and temperature in saturated vapours and the law of increase of density and temperature in air while being compressed or diluted.
