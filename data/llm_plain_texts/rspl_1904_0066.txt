tldr: 'The author conducted experiments to investigate if an electromotive force is induced in a dielectric when it moves in a magnetic field, as predicted by Maxwell's electromagnetic theory, as developed by H. A. Lorentz and Larmor. The results showed that a radial electric displacement is produced in a dielectric, such as ebonite, when it is rotated in a magnetic field parallel to the axis of revolution. The findings confirmed the theories of Lorentz and Larmor.'
