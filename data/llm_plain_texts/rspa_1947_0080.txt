revised_title: Density Increments of Proteins: The Influence of Protein Concentration and Salt Concentration
semantic_tags:
  - Protein density

  - Density increments
  - Haemoglobin
  - Protein solutions
tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the relationship between protein concentration and density increments in protein solutions, specifically focusing on haemoglobin. They found that the density increment is constant within experimental errors and is independent of protein concentration. The study also showed that the density increment is influenced by the presence of salts in the protein solution.
