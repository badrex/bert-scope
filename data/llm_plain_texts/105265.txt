tldr: This article discusses the origin and function of lymphatic vessels in animals. The author presents two theories on the connection between lymphatics and blood vessels, critiques them, and proposes a new understanding of lymphatic vessel origin based on observations of the mesentery. The author concludes that lymphatic vessels likely originate from the cellular substance of muscles, tendons, and membranous parts, and play a crucial role in maintaining life and motion by transporting lymph back to the blood.
