tldr: The authors describe the subcommissural organ, a structure found in the brains of all vertebrates, and its connection to Reissner's fiber. They discuss its development and evolution, from its well-developed state in lower vertebrates to its reduced form in humans. The subcommissural organ is a part of the brain's anatomy and may have an important function related to the associated Reissner's fiber.
