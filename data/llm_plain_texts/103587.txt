tldr: 'Monsieur Couzier conducted an experiment on the transmission of the plague using the blood of a person who had died from the disease. He injected the blood into a dog's vein and also applied it to a wound on the dog. The dog became ill and eventually died, showing signs of plague infection. The experiment demonstrated the potential for bloodborne transmission of the plague.'
