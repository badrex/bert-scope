tldr: The article discusses the challenges in detecting trace element deficiency diseases and the need for more effective biochemical diagnostic techniques. It highlights the importance of understanding the metabolic origins of pathological changes in trace element-deficient subjects and the need for better indices of deficiency. The article also emphasizes the relevance of local changes in trace element content and the potential of subcellular trace element analysis in identifying cell types most sensitive to suboptimal trace element supply.
