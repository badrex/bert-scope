tldr: The author discusses foetal respiration in mammals, focusing on the role of the placenta in the exchange of gases. The placenta's efficiency is influenced by factors such as the size of the capillary bed, blood pressure in the umbilical artery, and the oxygen used by the foetus. The author also highlights the importance of the oxygen difference between the blood in the umbilical vein and artery, which remains relatively constant towards the end of pregnancy.
