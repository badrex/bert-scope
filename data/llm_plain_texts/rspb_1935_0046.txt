tldr: The study investigates the effect of oestrin on the denervated sexual skin of primates. It demonstrates that despite denervation, the changes in the sexual skin in response to oestrin injections are similar to those in intact animals. This research contributes to understanding the role of neural influences in generative mechanisms and reproductive functions.
