revised_title: 'Stable Expression and Electrophysiological Characterization of a Drosophila GABA Receptor'
semantic_tags:
  - 'Neurotransmitter Receptors'
  - 'GABA Receptors'
  - 'Drosophila'
  - 'Ion Channels'
  - 'Stable Expression System'
tldr: 'The authors successfully established a stable Drosophila cell line expressing the cloned Drosophila Rdl GABA receptor subunit. They demonstrated functional GABA-gated ion channels in these cell lines through electrophysiological recordings. The stable expression system provides a suitable platform for characterizing receptors and ion channels.'
