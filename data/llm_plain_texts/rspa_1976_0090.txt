tldr: The author presents a method to separate Dirac's equation for the electron in Kerr geometry, allowing for the study of electrons near black holes. The solution is expressed as a superposition of solutions derived from a purely radial and a purely angular equation, providing a new approach to understanding the behavior of electrons in the vicinity of Kerr black holes.
