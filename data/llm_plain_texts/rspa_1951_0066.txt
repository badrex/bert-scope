tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the inner potentials of various crystals, such as rock-salt, quartz, and silver, using electron diffraction methods. They found that the inner potential of a crystal is influenced by the surface layers and that different crystallographically oriented surfaces can yield different inner potentials. This study helps to understand the factors affecting the inner potential measurements and improve the accuracy of future experiments.
