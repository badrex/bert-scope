tldr: The authors discovered new hierarchies of Korteweg-de Vries and Boussinesq equations with multiple soliton solutions. These equations do not fit the present inverse formalism or possess the properties associated with it, such as Backlund transformations. The most interesting new Korteweg-de Vries equation has -soliton solutions, and the authors suggest that higher-order scattering problems could be a future area of research.
