tldr: The author, Edward Delaval, discusses his experiments on the conversion of substances and the influence of heat on electricity. He found that certain stones and earthy substances can be converted into electrics through various methods, including different degrees of heat. Delaval also observed that the electric properties of some substances, like island crystal, can be destroyed or restored by heating and cooling. He suggests that further research should be conducted on the effects of cold on substances that are not known to be electric.
