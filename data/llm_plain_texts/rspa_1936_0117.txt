tldr: The authors investigated the connection between cosmic ray showers and bursts using an ionization chamber and Geiger-MÃ¼ller counters. They found that the number of particles in a shower can be measured by recording the ionization in the chamber during triple coincidences. The results showed a distribution of shower sizes, with a majority having over 20,000 ionization units, indicating a high number of particles. The study also demonstrated the effectiveness of the controlled recording technique for measuring high time resolution events.
