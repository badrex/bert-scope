revised_title: 'Copper Toxicity and Its Effects on Microsomal Membrane ATPase'

tldr: 'This study investigates the toxicity of copper on microsomal membrane ATPase in pigeon brain tissue. The research shows that copper inhibits the enzyme, with cadmium exhibiting similar toxicity. The findings suggest that copper's inhibitory effect on membrane ATPase may be responsible for its excitatory effect in vivo.'
