revised_title: 'Application of the Method of Integral Relations to Three-Dimensional Laminar Boundary Layers'

tldr: The authors extend the method of integral relations to solve three-dimensional compressible boundary layer flows with and without separation. They apply the method to two incompressible model problems and a supersonic laminar boundary layer flow over a swept back wedge, demonstrating its accuracy and efficiency compared to finite difference methods.
