tldr: This article presents a kinematic description of the restrictions imposed on eye movements due to nonlinear interactions between desired changes in viewing direction and current eye position. The author develops a scheme that considers Listing's law as the basic relation between viewing direction and eye torsion, with convergence and head orientation modifying this relation. This descriptive scheme may help elucidate the control of eye torsion in the brainstem.
