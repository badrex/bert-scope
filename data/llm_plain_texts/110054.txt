tldr: Mr. Knox conducted experiments on various minerals to demonstrate the frequent presence of bitumen or an analogous substance. He warns analysts about the common mistake of attributing loss during mineral analysis to the evaporation of aqueous matter. He found bitumen in most minerals from Werner's Flotz Trap formation and in some older rocks, though in smaller quantities and less easily separable. Knox recommends distillation as a process for obtaining liquid bitumen and estimating the carbon content in stony substances.
