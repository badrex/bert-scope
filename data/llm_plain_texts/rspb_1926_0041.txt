semantic_tags:
  - Metabolism
  - Insulin
  - Lactacidogen
  - Skeletal muscles
  - Phosphate ester
tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the effect of insulin on lactacidogen content in skeletal muscles. They found that even when the inorganic phosphorus of the blood is kept at a high level, there is no storage of dextrose as a phosphate ester in the skeletal muscles.
