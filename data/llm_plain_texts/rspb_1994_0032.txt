tldr: 'In a study of fairy-wrens, researchers found that females have a high rate of extra-pair fertilizations, with 76% of offspring being sired by extra-group males. This is the highest known incidence of cuckoldry. Female fairy-wrens show a preference for certain extra-group male genotypes, leading to the production of sons that also gain extra-group fertilizations. The presence of male helpers in the breeding group provides females with an alternative source of paternal care, allowing them to express unrestricted mate choice.'
