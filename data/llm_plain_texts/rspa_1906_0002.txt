tldr: In 1905, an expedition from the Royal Observatory observed the total solar eclipse of August 30 at Sfax, Tunisia. They took photographs of the corona and spectrum for further study. The team faced challenges, including cloudy conditions and haze, which affected their observations. The photographs were developed at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich.
