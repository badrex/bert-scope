tldr: The authors studied the influence of molecular flexibility on the transfer of vibrational energy in hydrocarbons using ultrasonic methods. They found that molecular flexibility plays a significant role in promoting the interconversion of translational and vibrational energy during collisions. The results confirm that molecular flexibility is more important than low mass or close overlap of vibrational energy levels in favoring interconversion.
