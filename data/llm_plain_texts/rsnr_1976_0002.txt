tldr: 'This article examines the social background and changing fortunes of the early scientific institution, the Royal Society, by analyzing its membership from 1660 to 1685. The author discusses the reasons for some scientific enthusiasts joining while others did not, and the extent to which membership could be due to motives unrelated to an interest in science. The study highlights the importance of London-based connections and the limited representation of provincial enthusiasts in the Society's membership.'
