semantic_tags:
  - Dissociative recombination
  - Single-electron transition
  - Polyatomic ions
  - Radiationless transition
  - Recombination coefficient
tldr: The author explains that rapid dissociative recombination can occur in the absence of a crossing of potentials through a single-electron radiationless transition. This process is common in polyatomic hydride ions and may be significant for some diatomic ions. The recombination coefficient is increased by including additional intermediate Rydberg states in the calculation.
