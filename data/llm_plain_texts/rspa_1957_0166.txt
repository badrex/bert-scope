tldr: The authors conducted experiments on annealed metals, such as copper, nickel, and aluminum, to study their behavior under alternating plastic strain. They found that metals initially strain-harden during the early cycles of deformation, but this hardening eventually levels off, indicating non-hardening plastic strain. The researchers also discovered that the total plastic strain that can be achieved without fracture in the non-hardening stage is much higher than in static deformation. This study provides insights into the mechanisms of fatigue and the behavior of metals under cyclic loading.
