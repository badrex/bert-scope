tldr: The author, F. W. Aston, developed a new mass-spectrograph with five times the resolving power of the previous one, allowing for the separation of mass lines of the heaviest elements known. The new instrument's accuracy is 1 in 10,000, enabling the measurement of divergences from the whole number rule. This research helps to determine the isotopic constitution of elements and provides insight into atomic physics.
