tldr: The authors conducted experiments on gold-copper alloys to study their properties and freezing points. They discovered that the alloys' freezing points form a curve with two branches, and that the gold-copper series does not have a eutectic alloy as previously believed. The authors also found that the alloys' tensile strength and extensibility vary, with the eutectic alloy being more brittle than other members of the series.
