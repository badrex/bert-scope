tldr: The authors extend the averaged Lagrangian method for analyzing slowly varying nonlinear wavetrains to include cases with small dissipation. They use a pseudo-variational principle introduced by Prigogine, where the Lagrangian depends on a function to be varied and the solution of the problem, to describe irreversible processes. Examples of applications to both ordinary and partial differential equations are presented.
