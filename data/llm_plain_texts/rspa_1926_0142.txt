tldr: The author studied the hydrogen bands in the ultra-violet Lyman region and found that the bands are due to changes in the electronic and vibrational quantum numbers. The temperature effect on the bands shows that each band originates from the rotation of the hydrogen molecule, and the origin of different bands is the vibration of the molecule. The study also suggests that the motion of particles in the molecule is more complex than in simple rotation-vibration bands.
