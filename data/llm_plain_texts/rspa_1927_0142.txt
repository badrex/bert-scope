tldr: This article investigates the contact and film thickness between flat surfaces, particularly between glass and steel surfaces, using the wringing process. The authors explore the adherence between surfaces and the role of liquid films in enhancing that adherence. They also describe two methods for measuring the thickness of the wringing film, the Area Method and the Interferometer Method. The findings provide a qualitative explanation of the wringing process and its applications in workshop practice.
