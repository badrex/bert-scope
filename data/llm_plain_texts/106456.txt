tldr: 'William Herschel invents the Lamp-Micrometer, an instrument that can measure very small angles accurately. It eliminates the imperfections of previous micrometers and has an enlarged scale. The instrument is useful for measuring the distance between close double stars and can be used in astronomy and other fields requiring precise angular measurements.'
