tldr: Researchers Sir John Randall and Claire Disbrey discovered DNA in the basal body sites of Tetrahymena pyriformis, a type of ciliate cell. They used synchronized cultures and autoradiographic techniques to confirm the presence of DNA in these organelles. This finding could help explain the precise proliferation of basal bodies and their role in cell development and organization.
