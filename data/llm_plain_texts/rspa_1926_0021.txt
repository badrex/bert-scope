tldr: This study examines the band spectrum of tin monochloride and identifies isotope effects. The researchers, W. Jevons and H. C. Plummer, found that the spectrum exhibited differences due to the presence of isotopes of tin and chlorine, which provided insights into the chemical and physical properties of the compound.
