tldr: The article investigates the molecular biology of prion diseases, focusing on the characterization of PrP binding proteins. Two main proteins, Pli 110 and Pli 125, were identified and found to be associated with membranes but not integral membrane proteins. These proteins may represent intracellular binding sites and could play a role in prion disease progression.
