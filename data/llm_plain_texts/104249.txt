tldr: A 68-year-old woman named Elizabeth Brian is discovered to be nursing her two granddaughters. Despite her age and the fact that she had not borne a child for over 20 years, she was able to produce milk and care for her grandchildren. The children were reported to be healthy, well-nourished, and thriving under their grandmother's care. This case is documented as an unusual and miraculous event.
