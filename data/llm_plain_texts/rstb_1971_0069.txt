tldr: The article discusses the physiological evidence for quantal transmitter release in synaptic transmission. It explains that transmitter substances are secreted in minimal "quantal" packets, which are released spontaneously at random intervals. During stimulation, these packets are discharged at a much higher frequency. The rate of release increases momentarily by a factor of nearly 10^6 following the arrival of a nerve impulse. The article also presents evidence for the concept of intracellular prepackaging of the transmitter in synaptic vesicles.
