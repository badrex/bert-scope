tldr: The authors studied the streamers in the inductive spark using monochromatic lights of various metallic lines. They found that streamers consist of charged metal atoms and their motion is due to the electric force of the spark. The streamers' appearances differ based on the metallic lines, and they can be classified into three categories: blurred, sharply-defined, and short-lived. The differences in streamers are solely due to the duration of the corresponding metallic lines' luminosity.
