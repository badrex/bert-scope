tldr: This study investigates the chemical reactions in the 'end-gas' of a spark-ignition engine that lead to engine knock. The authors used a specially designed electromagnetic gas-sampling valve to follow the sequence of reactions and analyzed the sampled gas for intermediate and final products. They found that substances which form free radicals in the engine cylinder act as pro-knocks, while additives like lead tetraethyl can reduce knock by inhibiting the formation of peroxides and aldehydes.
