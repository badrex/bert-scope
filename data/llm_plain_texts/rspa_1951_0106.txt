tldr: The authors discuss the influence of conjugation on heterolytic dissociation energies in chemical reactions. They develop a quantitative theory using molecular orbital theory and first-order perturbation theory, which helps predict the effect of substitution and structural changes on reaction energies. The theory is applied to reactions involving isoelectronic species, providing insights into the reactivity of molecules and the behavior of electrophilic and nucleophilic reagents.
