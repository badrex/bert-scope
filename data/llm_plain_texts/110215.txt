tldr: The author, David Brewster, investigates the law of partial polarization of light by reflection and refraction. He challenges the prevailing notion that partially polarized light consists of two portions, one wholly polarized and the other not changed. Brewster demonstrates that every portion of the reflected beam has undergone a physical change due to the action of reflecting forces. He also applies the law of repartition of light when doubly refracted to establish the correctness of his hypothesis. Furthermore, he concludes that common light is composed of rays in every state of positive and negative polarization, and that the laws governing the polarization of light by reflection and refraction are as well determined as those regulating the motions of planets.
