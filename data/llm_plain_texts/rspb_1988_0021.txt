tldr: The study investigates the expression of ACh-activated channels and sodium channels in innervated and denervated muscle using Xenopus oocytes. The results show that oocytes injected with mRNA from denervated muscle acquired high sensitivity to ACh, while those with mRNA from innervated muscle showed little response. The study also found that voltage-activated sodium currents induced by mRNA from innervated muscle were about three times larger than those from denervated muscle, suggesting that innervated muscle contains more mRNA coding for sodium channels. Furthermore, sodium currents induced by denervated muscle mRNA were relatively more resistant to block by tetrodotoxin, indicating that a proportion of the sodium channels in denervated muscle may be encoded by different mRNAs.
