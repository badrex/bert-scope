tldr: This article investigates Sychev's proposal for laminar separation in incompressible fluids, which is based on Kirchhoff's free streamline theory. The study examines the triple-deck structure around the separation point and determines that a solution exists and is unique. The findings support the triple-deck description of separation, providing encouraging agreement with experimental and numerical data for flows past bluff bodies and possibly internal flow situations.
