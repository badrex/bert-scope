tldr: The authors studied the effects of adrenergic amines on uterine smooth muscle, focusing on the ionic mechanisms behind hyperpolarization and the relationship between tissue cyclic AMP and tissue calcium content. They found that isoproterenol caused membrane hyperpolarization and increased tissue cyclic AMP levels, leading to relaxation. The study also suggested that a calcium-dependent electrogenic pump, possibly activated by cyclic AMP, plays a role in adrenergically mediated relaxation in the myometrium.
