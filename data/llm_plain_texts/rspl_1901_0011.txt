tldr: The author conducted experiments using hydrogen and helium gas thermometers to determine the boiling point of liquid hydrogen. They found that the boiling point of hydrogen was -253.0°C and that of oxygen was -182.2°C. The results confirmed the reliability of the gas thermometer method for measuring low temperatures.
