tldr: This study investigates the effects of foreign gases on the decomposition of di-tertiary-butyl peroxide. Carbon tetrachloride, silicon tetrafluoride, and sulfur hexafluoride accelerate the reaction, while the addition of ammonia, propylene, or iso-butene inhibits the acceleration. The findings suggest that these accelerations may be caused by chain processes involving chlorine atoms.
