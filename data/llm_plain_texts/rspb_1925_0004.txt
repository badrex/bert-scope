revised_title: 'The Mechanism of Kidney Secretion: A Study on Isolated Kidneys'
semantic_tags:
  - Kidney function
  - Urine secretion
  - Renal physiology
  - Organ perfusion
  - Defibrinated blood
tldr: The authors conducted experiments on isolated kidneys using a heart-lung preparation and defibrinated blood to study the mechanism of urine secretion. They found that the kidney's function, blood flow, and urine production could be controlled under these artificial conditions, allowing for a better understanding of the complex processes involved in kidney function.
