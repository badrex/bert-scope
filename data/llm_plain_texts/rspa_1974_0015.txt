tldr: The authors present a general solution for a statistical problem proposed by E. A. Milne. They consider a model with independent intervals and random variables, providing a method to estimate unknown parameters and their variances. The study also highlights the 'periodic' behavior of variances and offers suggestions for choosing the number of intervals to achieve optimal estimation precision.
