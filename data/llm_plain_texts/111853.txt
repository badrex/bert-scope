tldr: The author discusses the process of coal-gas purification using clay and its effects on the illuminating power of the gas. Clay is found to remove certain nitrogen compounds that reduce the light-giving power of the gas, while also not removing valuable hydrocarbon vapours. The author also presents a method to determine the value of gas as an illuminant by using acid-treated sawdust.
