tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the structure of the yeast cell wall by degrading it with various enzymes. They found that enzymes from Helix pomatia and malt effectively dissolved the cell walls, and the rapidity of the reactions was proportional to the phosphorus content. The main components of the cell wall are an insoluble glucan matrix, a protein 'cement,' and mannan. The authors also identified glucose and N-acetylglucosamine as products of the enzymatic degradation.
