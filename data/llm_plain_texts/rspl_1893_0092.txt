tldr: The author presents a new theory of the electric and luminiferous medium, proposing that its elasticity is of a purely rotational type. This theory explains the behavior of light and its properties, such as the reflection and refraction of light waves, by considering the medium as a combination of vortices and spinning gyrostats. The author also discusses the contributions of other scientists, such as Thomas Young, Augustin Cauchy, Franz Neumann, George Green, and James MacCullagh, who have worked on understanding the nature of light and its propagation.
