tldr: The author conducted experiments to measure the kathode fall of potential in various gases, such as hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. They found that the kathode fall is a constant value for each gas, independent of the gas pressure or current strength. The author also discussed the challenges they faced while conducting experiments with compound gases and the importance of maintaining a constant current for accurate measurements.
