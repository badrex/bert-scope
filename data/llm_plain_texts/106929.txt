tldr: Benjamin Count of Rumford conducted experiments to determine the force of fired gunpowder and discovered that its initial expansive force is much greater than previously thought. He found that the force of gunpowder is at least fifty thousand times greater than the mean pressure of the atmosphere. This research has implications for understanding the mechanics of gunpowder and potential improvements in the field of gunnery.
