revised_title: 'Glycosylation's Role in Functional Voltage-Activated Channels in Developing Neocortical Neurons'

  - Neuronal development
  - Glycosylation
  - Voltage-activated channels
  - Neocortical neurons
  - Tunicamycin
tldr: The study investigates the effects of tunicamycin, an inhibitor of protein N-glycosylation, on voltage-activated currents in cultured neocortical neurons from rat embryos. The results show that N-linked carbohydrate attachment is essential for the functional expression of voltage-operated channels during the early stages of nerve cell growth in culture, while channels in mature neurons become less dependent on glycosylation.
