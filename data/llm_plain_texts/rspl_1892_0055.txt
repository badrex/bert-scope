tldr: The author presents a new method for estimating uric acid in urine using saturation with ammonium chloride. This process allows for a rapid and complete separation of uric acid, eliminating the need for corrections due to incomplete separation. The method also offers improvements in the separation of urinary phosphates. This new process has significant implications for the estimation and analysis of uric acid in urine samples.
