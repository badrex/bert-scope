tldr: The author presents a hypothesis about the Earth's primitive formation and figure, assuming it was initially a heterogeneous fluid mass. He provides analytical expressions for its ellipticity and gravity variation at the surface. This hypothesis has implications for physical geology, particularly in understanding changes to the Earth's external crust during its solidification process.
