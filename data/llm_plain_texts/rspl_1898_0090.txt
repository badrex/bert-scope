tldr: The author conducted experiments on animals to study the relationship between antagonistic muscles and motor coordination. They discovered that when one side of the facial nerve is cut, the opposite side's muscles become more active, leading to asymmetrical facial expressions and eye movements. This phenomenon is called reciprocal innervation and helps in understanding how the nervous system controls muscle movements.
