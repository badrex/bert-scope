tldr: The author discusses the role of water structure in biochemistry and physiology, focusing on how substances can affect the structure of water and its interactions with other molecules. They explore the effects of solutes on dough properties and the potential role of plant compounds in controlling water structure, which may have implications for animal cells, particularly in the nervous system.
