tldr: This article explores the formation of microstructure in polymer blends, focusing on the effects of molecular, rheological, and thermodynamic parameters on phase diagrams. It discusses the basis of miscibility in binary polymer blends and the kinetics of phase separation processes. The authors provide examples of specific polymer blends and their resulting morphologies, highlighting the importance of understanding and manipulating these parameters to achieve desirable material properties.
