tldr: This article presents an analysis of baptisms, marriages, and burials in the parish of Blandford Forum, Dorset, over a period of 40 years. The author, Richard Pulteney, examines the parish's vital records to determine the salubrity of the area and compares it to other locations in England and London. The study shows that Blandford Forum has a lower mortality rate than larger towns and supports the general opinion of the area's healthiness. The author also provides data on smallpox deaths during the study period.
