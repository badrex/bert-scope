tldr: The authors conducted experiments using interference methods to study the origin of certain spectrum lines. They determined the limiting order of interference for different radiations, which allowed them to make deductions about the temperature of the source and the masses of the particles involved in their production. The research focused on the spectra of calcium, strontium, and barium, providing insights into the nature of luminous particles and the possibility of molecules producing line series in addition to band spectra.
