tldr: The author, Lionel S. Beale, discusses the distribution of nerve fibers in muscles and other tissues, and the structure and mode of action of a nervous mechanism. Beale's research focuses on understanding the arrangement of nerve fibers and their role in muscular and other tissue movements. He concludes that nerves form circuits and that the active phenomena are due to changes in the intensity of the current passing along the nerves.
