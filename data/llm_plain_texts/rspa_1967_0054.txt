tldr: The article discusses the concept of stereospecific induction in transition metal complexes, focusing on the use of optically active ligands to determine the absolute configuration of chelate-containing complexes. The authors explore the factors governing stereospecificity and the effect of substitution in the remaining octahedral positions on circular dichroism spectra. They also provide a theoretical and experimental basis for understanding the spectroscopic properties of d-d transitions in octahedral complexes.
