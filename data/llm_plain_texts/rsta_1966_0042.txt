tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the formation of water drops that cause erosion in steam turbine blades. They used a specially developed periscope and cine camera to observe the process inside an operating turbine. The study confirmed that condensed steam forms a fog of droplets, which are responsible for the erosion of turbine blades. The authors also analyzed the size and mass of water drops impacting on the blades, providing insights into the erosion process and potential solutions for preventing damage to turbines.
