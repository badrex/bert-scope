tldr: The study examines the structure of the antennular attachment organ in the cypris larva of Balanus balanoides, focusing on the third segment and attachment organ. The attachment organ is covered with cuticular villi and has sensory structures called scolopidia, which are suitable for chemoreception. The presence of these receptors indicates that a chemosensory mechanism could operate during the gregarious behavior of settling cyprids.
