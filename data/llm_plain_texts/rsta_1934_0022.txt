tldr: The author investigates the interaction between clay and water or organic liquids, focusing on specific volume changes and its relation to crumb formation in soils. The study shows that crumb formation is limited to clay particles with considerable base exchange capacity and is induced by liquids with an appreciable dipole moment. The stability of the crumbs depends on the liquid and the exchangeable cations of the particles. The findings provide insights into soil structure, natural tilth, and plant growth.
