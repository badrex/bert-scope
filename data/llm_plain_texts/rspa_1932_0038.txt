tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the oxidation of phosphorus vapour at low pressures in the presence of platinum and tungsten. They found that the reaction occurs entirely on the surface of the platinum filament, while tungsten can initiate the reaction at its surface, with chains spreading into the gas and presumably terminating on the walls of the reaction tube. The results suggest that the reaction is heterogeneous and partly homogeneous, with the reaction rate being independent of phosphorus and argon concentration.
