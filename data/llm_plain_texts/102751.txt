tldr: Mr. Geoffrey explains the process of determining the exact quantity of acid salts contained in acid spirits. He describes a new instrument called the "Araeometer" for measuring the volume of liquids and discusses the variations in weight due to changes in weather. He also provides a method to determine the quantity of salt contained in a given volume of acid spirit by comparing it with a known acid spirit.
