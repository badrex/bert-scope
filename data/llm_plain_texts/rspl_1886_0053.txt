tldr: The author conducted experiments on the sympathetic vibrations of air jets and flames. They discovered that certain vibrations could be transmitted through air jets and reproduced from flames, allowing for the reproduction of speech and musical sounds. The author also found that the intensity of these vibrations depended on the distance from the orifice and the pressure of the air jet.
