tldr: The author presents a study on the dynamic nonlinear forcing of elastic rings using shell theory. They derive equations of motion and constitutive equations to analyze the behavior of rings under pressure loading. The study introduces the concept of the dynamic axis and explores the relationship between the midsurface, neutral, and dynamic axes in the ring.
