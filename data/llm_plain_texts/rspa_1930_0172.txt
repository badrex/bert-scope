tldr: This study investigates the effect of lithium chloride on the activities of water and alcohol in mixed solutions. The research focuses on the interaction between ions and solvent molecules, specifically solvation and the salting-out effect. The authors use the air-bubbling method to determine the partial pressures of water and alcohol in the solutions, providing insights into the behavior of electrolytes in mixed solvents.
