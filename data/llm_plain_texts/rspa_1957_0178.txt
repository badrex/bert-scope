tldr: The authors studied the optical rotations of various synthetic polypeptides in different solvents and found that the behavior of these polypeptides can be interpreted in terms of the relative stability of left-handed helices, right-handed helices, and random coils. They discovered that predominantly right-handed helices exist in non-polar solvents, and the optical rotation of a right-handed helical form of several meso polypeptides is not markedly dependent on the solvent.
