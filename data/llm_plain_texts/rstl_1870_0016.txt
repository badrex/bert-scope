tldr: This article explores the contact of conics with surfaces, specifically focusing on tangent conics. The author establishes a theorem that states that at every point of a surface, ten conics can be drawn with six-pointic contact. The study of these conics and their contact with surfaces contributes to the understanding of geometry and algebraic geometry.
