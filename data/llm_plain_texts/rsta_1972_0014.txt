tldr: Researchers analyzed high-quality Lunar Orbiter photographs to study the origin of craters in the maria regions of the Moon. They used a statistical approach to separate craters of primary impact, endogenic origin, and secondary impact. The study found strong evidence for a high proportion of tectonic origin in the observed crater chains. This research helps in understanding the Moon's geological history and the formation of lunar craters.
