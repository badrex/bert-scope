tldr: The author, William Hyde Wollaston, conducted experiments to understand the property of diamonds to cut glass. He found that the diamond must be placed at a specific angle to create a superficial crack in the glass, which can then be extended with minimal force. Wollaston also discovered that other mineral bodies with similar forms can cut glass but lose their ability quickly due to lack of hardness.
