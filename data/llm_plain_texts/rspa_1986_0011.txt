tldr: The author examines the existence of conical turbulent vortex solutions in the Navier-Stokes equations by introducing variable eddy viscosity. They find that for a specific class of eddy viscosity functions, a steady turbulent vortex can satisfy both the regularity condition at the core and the adherence condition at the surface, except for a singularity at the origin. This discovery reveals a connection between the behavior and existence of vortices and turbulence.
