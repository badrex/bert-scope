tldr: The authors describe their experiments on the ionization of nitrogen gas using electron impact. They developed a new method combining an ionizing potential apparatus with a positive-ray analysis system to study the types of ions produced in gases. The authors found that nitrogen's ionization occurs at about 17 volts, producing singly charged molecular ions, and atomic ions at around 30 volts. The study also discusses the challenges faced during the experiments, such as gas leakage and stray effects.
