tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the thermal conductivity of various gases at 0°C. They found that the thermal resistance of gases is inversely proportional to their temperature and provide a mathematical formula to calculate it. This research contributes to understanding heat transfer in gases and their applications in engineering and technology.
