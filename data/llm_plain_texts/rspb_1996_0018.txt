tldr: The author reinterprets the homologies of the shoulder girdle in turtles based on recent phylogenetic studies. They conclude that the acromion process, a distinctive feature of turtle shoulder girdles, is an extension of the scapula blade and not a modified anterior coracoid. This finding sheds light on the evolution and function of the shoulder girdle in turtles and their early ancestors.
