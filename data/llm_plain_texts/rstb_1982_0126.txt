tldr: This article discusses the molecular biology of cell locomotion and the implications of cytoskeletal interactions for cellular architecture and behavior. The authors present evidence for different types of structural interactions between cytoskeletal filaments and their relative contributions to the formation and consolidation of various cellular domains. They also explore a unique example of a coordinated interaction linking cell membrane events, the contractile machinery, and the microtubule system in polymorphonuclear leucocytes.
