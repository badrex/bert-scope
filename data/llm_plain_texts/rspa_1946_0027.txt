tldr: The authors develop a quantitative theory of the dielectric properties of crystalline solids consisting of long-chain molecules with one dipole per molecule. They focus on the interaction between dipoles and the behavior of these solids at different temperatures. The static dielectric constant increases with temperature up to a critical point, after which it decreases. The authors also predict the existence of metastable states with permanent polarization and discuss methods to reach these states.
