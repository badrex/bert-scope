tldr: The authors derived expressions for the power radiated in compressional, shear, and surface waves generated by a circular disk vibrating on the surface of a semi-infinite isotropic solid. They calculated the total radiated power using admittance and mutual admittance functions, which they applied to a three-element radiator used in a geophysical investigation. The study helps in understanding the energy partition between different types of waves and improving the design of radiators for efficient energy transmission.
