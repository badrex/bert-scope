tldr: The author provides a rigorous justification for the formal uniform asymptotic approximations to a certain pair of solutions of the Orr-Sommerfeld equation, which describes small disturbances in a fluid with a basic velocity profile. The study uses the asymptotic solutions of Lin & Rabenstein and develops a theory to prove the validity of Eagles' approximations.
