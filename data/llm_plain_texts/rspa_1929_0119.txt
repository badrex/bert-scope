tldr: The authors investigate the stability of unimolecular films and the mechanism of film expansion. They demonstrate that the tendency to spread into an expanded state increases with the acidity of the solution. The study focuses on the adhesion of fatty acid films to aqueous solutions and how altering the hydrogen ion concentration affects the state of the film. The findings suggest that the molecules in the solid condensed film are tilted at an angle that allows the zigzag chains to interlock, and this tilt depends on the structure of the chain and the asymmetry of the head group.
