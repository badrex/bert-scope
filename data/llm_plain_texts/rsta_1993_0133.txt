tldr: The authors investigate the distribution of integers without large prime factors in short intervals. They prove an asymptotic formula for the number of such integers in a given range and discuss the limitations of the current understanding of the problem. The results have implications for understanding the distribution of smooth numbers and the behavior of prime numbers.
