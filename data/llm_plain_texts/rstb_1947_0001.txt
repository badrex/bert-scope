tldr: The author conducted experiments on the shoot apex of the fern Dryopteris aristata to investigate its growth and morphogenesis. They partially isolated the apical meristem from adjacent tissues by severing the incipient vascular tissue, allowing the meristem to grow into short shoots bearing leaves. The study provides insights into the factors influencing the differentiation of vascular systems and the distribution of nutrients in plants, as well as the role of morphogenetic factors in plant development.
