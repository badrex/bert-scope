tldr: This article explores the use of time-resolved crystallography and Laue diffraction to study the hydrolysis of a transiently stable intermediate in trypsin catalysis. The authors demonstrate the potential of Laue diffraction in dynamic studies, despite challenges such as crystal imperfections and synchronization issues. They analyze the effects of pH, crystal quality, and exposure times on the reliability of Laue results and discuss the importance of high-quality crystals for accurate measurements.
