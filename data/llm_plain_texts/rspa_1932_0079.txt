tldr: This article investigates the dipole moments and molecular structures of trichlorides of phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony. The authors measure the dielectric constants and densities of dilute solutions of these compounds in benzene and calculate their electric moments. They find that the dipole moments increase with the atomic weight of the central atom, which is the opposite of the trend observed in the corresponding hydrides. This is due to the increasing electropositive character of the central atom.
