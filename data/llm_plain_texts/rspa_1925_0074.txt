tldr: This article discusses the effect of light on the settling of suspensions and the formation of layers in soil samples. The author observed that the presence of light causes irregularities in the settling process, leading to the formation of distinct layers. The phenomenon is similar to Liesegang ring formation, which is also affected by light. The author also found that the color of the light has an impact on the position and spacing of the layers, with red and blue light producing different results. The study has implications for soil classification and analysis.
