tldr: The authors investigate the temperature dependence of the magnetic moment in iron (111) complexes, considering the effects of configurational mixing and spin-orbit coupling. They derive an expression for the magnetic moment and compare their calculated results with experimental data for iron (111)-dialkyldithiocarbamates. The study shows that configurational mixing has a more significant impact on calculated magnetic moments, with changes of up to 10% for certain temperature ranges.
