tldr: The authors present the arrow model, a computer simulation that explains the formation of retinotectal maps in goldfish without requiring the tectum to be specified. The model accounts for the development, reconstitution, expansion, contraction, and rotation of the retino-tectal map. However, it is insufficient to explain optic nerve fiber regeneration in adult animals. The study contributes to understanding the minimum requirements for setting up continuously ordered maps and clarifies the term "specificity" in the context of neuronal mapping.
