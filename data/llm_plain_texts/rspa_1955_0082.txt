tldr: This article investigates the mechanism of rolling friction under conditions where deformations are predominantly elastic. The authors find that rolling resistance is primarily due to elastic hysteresis losses in the rubber, which explains why lubricants have little effect on rolling friction. They also explore the role of interfacial slip and its contribution to rolling friction, concluding that it plays a minor part compared to elastic hysteresis losses.
