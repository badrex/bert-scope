tldr: A. R. Clarke analyzes Archdeacon Pratt's measurements of local attraction and the distances between latitude parallels of principal stations. He compares the values of E and A for different arcs and discusses the impact of these measurements on determining the Earth's figure. Clarke finds that Pratt's rough approximation of local attraction at Burleigh Moor is close to the truth.
