tldr: Researchers discovered elements of a para-sexual cycle in the cellular slime mould, Dictyostelium discoideum. They isolated and characterized heterozygous diploids of the slime mould, which suggested the existence of a para-sexual cycle. This finding expanded our understanding of the complex life cycle of Dictyostelium discoideum and its genetic processes.
