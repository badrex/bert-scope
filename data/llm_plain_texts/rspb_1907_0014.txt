tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the natural and induced resistance of mice to cancer growth. They discovered that mice could be protected against transplantable carcinomas and that this protection was specific to mouse tumors. The findings shed light on the nature of cancer and the role of antibodies in protecting against it. The research also highlights the importance of understanding the distinction between the conditions of origin of a sporadic tumor and the conditions of cancer growth in mice.
