tldr: This study examines the skeletomusculature of siphonostomatoid copepods, specifically Hyalopontius typicus and Lepeophtheirus pectoralis, to understand how adaptation to parasitism has affected their morphology and musculature. The research also explores the oral cone structure and feeding mechanisms in various siphonostomatoid species, revealing adaptations for fluid feeding, surface grazing, and other specialized feeding behaviors.
