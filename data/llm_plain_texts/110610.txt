tldr: The author, W. Hopkins, discusses the hypothesis of the Earth's interior being in a fluid state and explores the modes of refrigeration. He examines the cooling process through circulation and conduction, and the possible conditions of the Earth's interior. Hopkins also suggests that the phenomena of precession and nutation could provide an indirect test for the hypothesis of central fluidity, reserving further investigation for a future memoir.
