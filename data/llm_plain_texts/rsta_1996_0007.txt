tldr: 'The article discusses the importance of understanding the morphology, composition, and structure of thin surface films on metals and alloys for corrosion protection. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy of ultramicrotomed sections provides a route to study these films and their growth processes. The author presents examples of various amorphous and crystalline films, emphasizing the need for precise analysis and observation over a wide resolution range. This approach offers flexibility and detailed insights into the nature of surface films on metals and alloys, contributing to the development of protection strategies.'
