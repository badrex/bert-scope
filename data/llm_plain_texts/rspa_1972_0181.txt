tldr: The authors studied the atomic structure and chemical composition of platinum surfaces using low energy electron diffraction and Auger electron spectroscopy. They found that the reactivity of low index and stepped platinum surfaces is different, with diatomic molecules adsorbing more readily on stepped surfaces. Organic molecules form ordered structures on low index faces but decompose rapidly on stepped surfaces. The dehydrocyclization of n-heptane occurs on stepped surfaces with specific atomic terraces, while the rate is slower on other surfaces. This research demonstrates the potential for studying catalytic reactions using single crystal surfaces with small surface areas.
