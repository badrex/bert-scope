revised_title: Active Sites in Periodic Adlayers and Heterogeneous Catalysis
semantic_tags:
  - Heterogeneous catalysis
  - Active sites

tldr: The article discusses the role of domain boundaries and active sites in heterogeneous catalysis. It explains how linear defects in adsorbed layers, such as incomplete coverage, full coverage, and phase boundaries, can act as chains of active sites in catalytic reactions. The study focuses on the relationship between the structure of the adlayer and the adsorbent, and how domain boundaries can enhance reactivity and influence the catalytic activity of adatoms.
