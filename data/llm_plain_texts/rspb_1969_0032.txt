tldr: The authors discuss the problem of cytoplasmic integration in living cells and propose a hypothesis for the existence of a fluid cytoskeleton that controls the organization and activity of enzymes within the cell. They argue that surface chemistry and molecular interactions play a crucial role in the integration of cellular processes and the response to environmental stimuli.
