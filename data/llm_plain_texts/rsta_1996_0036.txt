tldr: The authors analyze the three-dimensional stability of elliptical vortex columns in external strain flows using the geometrical optics method. They find that these columns are typically unstable, except when the interior vorticity is approximately the negative of the background vorticity, making the flow in the inertial frame nearly potential.
