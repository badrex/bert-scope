tldr: The authors used a new asymmetric rotor band contour program to study the rotational band contour of the 0-0 band of the 2750 Å system of phenol. They determined the band type and excited state rotational constants, providing insights into the molecule's structure and electronic properties. This research demonstrates the power of using large computers to analyze complex molecular structures and spectra.
