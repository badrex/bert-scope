tldr: The author examines the structure of lavas that have consolidated on steep slopes and discusses the role of eruption and upheaval in the formation of volcanic cones. They argue against the "Crater of Elevation" theory, which attributes the formation of volcanic mountains to upward and outward pressure from below, and instead propose that volcanic cones are formed by the cumulative effect of repeated eruptions. The author presents evidence from their observations of Madeira, the Canary Islands, and Mount Etna to support their argument.
