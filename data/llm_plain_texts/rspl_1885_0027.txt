tldr: The author investigates the limited hydration of ammonium carbamate and its reaction with water, focusing on the influence of time, mass, and temperature. The study shows that the action of hydration proceeds rapidly at first but becomes progressively slower, eventually reaching a limit. The time required to reach a specific level of hydration is greater for stronger solutions, indicating that hydration decreases as the relative number of water molecules increases. The author also explores the effect of temperature on the hydration process, finding that lower temperatures result in less hydration.
