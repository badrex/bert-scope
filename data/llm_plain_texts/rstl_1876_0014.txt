tldr: The authors studied the development and succession of poison-fangs in viperine snakes, discovering that venomous fangs are replaced in pairs and that the arrangement of these fangs is well-suited for speedy replacement. They also found that poison-fangs develop in two parallel series, with each series containing pairs of teeth in various stages of development.
