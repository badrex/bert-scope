tldr: This article discusses the connection between solar variability and Earth's climatic variations. The author explores the 200-year and 2000-year periods in solar activity and their potential effects on the climate. The study also examines the correlation between solar minima and cold winters in western Europe. The author suggests that archaeological evidence may contribute to understanding the impact of climate changes on early human migrations.
