tldr: The authors studied the cytochrome system in individual tissues of the Cecropia silkworm using low-temperature spectroscopy. They found that during metamorphosis, the cytochrome system undergoes significant changes, with some components disappearing and reappearing during the pupal diapause. The results suggest that the cytochrome system is closely linked to the action of the prothoracic gland hormone, which plays a role in the insect's growth and development.
