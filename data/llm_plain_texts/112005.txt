tldr: The author conducted a dissection of the pneumogastric and sympathetic nerves in an acephalous (without a head) foetus to study their origin, distribution, and function. The dissection revealed that these nerves were present and functioning similarly to those in a normal foetus, suggesting that the absence of a brain or spinal cord did not affect the nervous system's development. The study provides insights into the understanding of the nervous system and its role in the development of embryos.
