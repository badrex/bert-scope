tldr: The authors studied the isotope shifts and hyperfine structure in the spectrum of tellurium using enriched samples of stable isotopes. They compared the shifts in even isotopes with those in adjacent elements and discussed the results in terms of nuclear deformation. The odd-even staggering effect was also investigated, and the ratio of the widths of the hyperfine structures of isotopes 123 and 125 was found to agree with the ratio of their nuclear magnetic moments.
