tldr: The author investigates the effect of wind on sound transmission and explains how the variation in air temperature and wind velocity causes sound waves to refract, leading to differences in sound distinctness by day and night. The author also describes the phenomenon of sound waves being lifted or lowered by wind, resulting in the creation of secondary, diverging waves.
