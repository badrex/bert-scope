tldr: This study compares one-dimensional, two-dimensional, and three-dimensional models to understand the behavior of pollutants in the atmosphere. The research highlights the importance of accurate representation of variables in models and emphasizes the need for more precise measurements to improve the understanding of the effects of aircraft and chlorofluoromethanes on stratospheric ozone.
