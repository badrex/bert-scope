tldr: The authors investigated the influence of non-steadiness on the thickness of detonation waves. They developed a quasi-steady kinetic model to analyze the induction process and the flow field as a decaying blast wave. The results demonstrate that the wave thickness can become larger than in steady flow, and the induction time approaches infinity as the initially overdriven wave decays, indicating complete extinction of the detonation process.
