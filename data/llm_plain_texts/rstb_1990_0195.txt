tldr: The authors develop a new method to distinguish noise from low-dimensional chaos in ecological time series, allowing for better understanding of population dynamics and regulation. They apply this method to measles data in the United Kingdom, finding that city-scale dynamics exhibit low-dimensional chaos, while country-wide dynamics appear as a noisy two-year cycle. This work highlights the importance of scale in analyzing ecological systems and the potential for chaos in population dynamics.
