tldr: The author discusses the results of experiments conducted on Mont Blanc, comparing the absorptive effect of water vapor and dry air in the atmosphere. They found that water vapor's absorptive effect is five times greater than that of dry air. This study helps to understand the impact of water vapor on the atmosphere and climate.
