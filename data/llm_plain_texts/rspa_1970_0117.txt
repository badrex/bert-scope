  - Electrostatic Potential
tldr: The authors demonstrate that for a crystal to be in equilibrium, the electric field at each nuclear site must vanish. They show that simple Bravais lattices automatically satisfy this condition, while crystals with two atoms per unit cell require specific conditions for equilibrium. The authors also identify critical points in the electrostatic potential and discuss the symmetry of these points in various crystal structures.
