tldr: The author observed the motion of the stomach in a dog and described the peristaltic movement of the stomach and intestines. They suggested that the motion helps distribute nourishment and occurs when the stomach is full and the fibers try to restore their position. This observation provides a clearer understanding of how nourishment is distributed in the digestive system.
