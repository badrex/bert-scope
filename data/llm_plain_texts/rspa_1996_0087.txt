tldr: The author presents a transfer matrix analysis of the energetics of structural wave motion and harmonic vibration in conservative systems. They show that the transfer matrix is K-unitary and use its properties to derive new results regarding the energetics of wave motion and harmonic vibration. The study covers energy flow, time-averaged kinetic and potential energies, and the effects of damping on one-dimensional systems.
