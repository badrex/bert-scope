tldr: The authors present a lattice-gas model to simulate the dynamics of microemulsions, which are complex structures formed by the interaction of oil, water, and amphiphile (surfactant) molecules. The model allows for the study of both equilibrium and non-equilibrium phase behavior and can be used to investigate the evolution of binary and ternary systems. This approach offers a more unified and dynamic understanding of microemulsion systems compared to previous models.
