tldr: This article narrates a case study where a family consumed a pie made from the roots of the Horned Poppy (Papaver Corniculatum Luteum), mistaking them for Sea-Holly or Eringo roots. The family experienced delirium, hallucinations, and disorientation, believing everything they saw was gold. The effects were temporary and resolved after a few days. The author suggests that the yellow color of the flowers might have contributed to the hallucinations.
