tldr: This article investigates the chemical and isotopic heterogeneity of the Earth's mantle, specifically focusing on Archaean igneous rocks. The authors analyze strontium and lead isotopes, as well as trace and major elements, to understand the long-term effects of mantle heterogeneity. They find that the Archaean mantle was chemically and isotopically heterogeneous, with variations in Rb/Sr and U/Pb ratios in their sources. The authors also discuss the implications of these findings for understanding the Earth's mantle and its evolution.
