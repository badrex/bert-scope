tldr: This study investigates the impact of rotation on two-dimensional convection in a finite system. The research considers the effect of the Taylor number, which measures the rotation, on Benard convection between horizontal stress-free boundaries. The findings show that a steady finite amplitude solution evolves if the Prandtl number is greater than 0.577, but subcritical instability and bursting can occur for a certain range of Taylor numbers. The study also explores the behavior of the flow after a change in external conditions and the evolution of instability bursts in a finite domain.
