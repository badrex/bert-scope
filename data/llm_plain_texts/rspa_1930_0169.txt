tldr: The authors, Cockcroft and Walton, conducted experiments with high velocity positive ions and developed methods to accelerate them. They used a canal ray tube as a source of ions and explored various techniques for ion acceleration, including Tesla coils, impulse voltages, low frequency alternating potentials, and rectified steady potentials. Their work contributed to the understanding of nuclear physics and artificial disintegration.
