tldr: This study investigates the pigment-bearing organs (chromatophores) in certain crustaceans and their response to light. The research shows that under the influence of light, the secretory activity of specific organs is altered, and the appearance and disappearance of substances in the liver and muscles coincide with nocturnal and diurnal color changes. The response to light is two-fold: direct and indirect, through the mediation of the eye. The ultimate effect of monochromatic light on pigment movement is the same as that of white light, and background plays a crucial role in determining the nature and extent of pigment movements. The chromatophores are centers of metabolic activity, and a blue substance is produced from and at the expense of the diurnal chromatophore-pigments. The study also discusses the primary and secondary chromatophore systems in Decapod Crustacea and their role in color patterns.
