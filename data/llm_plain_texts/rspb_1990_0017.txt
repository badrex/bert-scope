tldr: This study examines the relationship between embryo size and pigmentation patterns in Alligator mississippiensis hatchlings. The researchers found that the number of white stripes on the dorsal side of embryos and hatchlings is affected by incubation temperature but not by sex. They also discovered that the appearance of pigmentation is accelerated in embryos incubated at a higher temperature, occurring eight days earlier than at a lower temperature. The researchers propose a possible pattern formation mechanism based on cell movement driven by chemotaxis and apply it to the pigmentation patterns of A. mississippiensis, showing that the length of the embryo at pattern formation is the prime factor in determining stripe number.
