tldr: The authors calculated the total electronic band structure energy for 29 elements using the screened model potential of Heine and Abarenkov. They divided the total energy of a metal into free electron energy, band structure energy, and electrostatic energy, and found a more convenient expression for the total band structure energy applicable to determining atomic properties, phonon spectra, interatomic forces, and liquid metal properties.
