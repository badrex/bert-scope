tldr: The authors explore inequalities between prime numbers and their applications, focusing on small differences between primes. They prove a new inequality using trigonometrical polynomials and improve upon previous methods like Brun's and Selberg's sieve methods. This work has implications for understanding the distribution of prime numbers and their differences.
