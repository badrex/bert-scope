tldr: This article investigates the scattering theory of how glare affects the brightness difference threshold in foveal vision. The authors criticize Holladay's previous work and present a revised scattering theory that addresses its shortcomings. They find that the observed increase in the threshold due to glare is not primarily caused by light scattering in the eye media, but rather by other factors.
