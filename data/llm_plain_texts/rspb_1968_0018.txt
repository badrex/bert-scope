revised_title: 'Isolation and Properties of a Polypeptide Hormone-Binding Protein in the Posterior Lobe of the Pituitary Gland'
semantic_tags:
  - Hormones
  - Polypeptide
  - Pituitary gland
  - Protein binding
  - Oxytocin
  - Vasopressin
tldr: The authors discuss the isolation of a protein from the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland that specifically binds oxytocin and vasopressin. They also explore the properties and potential functions of this cystine-rich protein, including its possible role in hormone synthesis and as a carrier for neurohypophysial hormones.
