tldr: This article discusses the alternative hypothesis of ancestral transfer of symbionts between cockroaches and termites, suggesting that protozoan transfer between their ancestors could have occurred under natural conditions. The author responds to concerns raised by Nalepa and reiterates the validity of the ancestral transfer hypothesis, focusing on the opportunities for interactions in Palaeozoic habitats and the role of laboratory experiments in understanding ancestral behaviors.
