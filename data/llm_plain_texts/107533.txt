revised_title: 'The Role of Fat in the Metamorphosis of Tadpoles into Frogs'

tldr: The author examines the process of metamorphosis in tadpoles and how they transform into frogs. They discovered that fat is stored in the tadpole's intestine and is essential for the metamorphosis process. The length of the intestine in tadpoles is much longer than in other animals, suggesting that it serves as a "laboratory" for fat formation. The author also found that the egg of a frog lacks yolk, which indicates that additional materials are needed for the tadpole to develop into a frog.
