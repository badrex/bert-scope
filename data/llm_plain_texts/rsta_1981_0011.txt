tldr: This article discusses the importance of non-destructive testing (NDT) methods, particularly ultrasonics, in detecting defects and assessing component integrity in conjunction with fracture mechanics. It explains the principles and applications of five main NDT techniques, focusing on ultrasonics and its ability to detect and measure cracks effectively. The article also highlights the implications of NDT limitations for component design and fracture mechanics assessment.
