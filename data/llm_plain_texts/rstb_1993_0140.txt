tldr: The authors developed a discrete bidomain model to describe the extracellular current flow and potential during synaptic transmission in a smooth muscle syncytium. The model considers the electrical coupling between individual smooth muscle cells and the extracellular space, allowing predictions about the potential drop in the extracellular space during secretion from varicosities at a known site in the syncytium. This theoretical work has been used to interpret recent experimental studies of extracellular current flow during autonomic neuromuscular transmission.
