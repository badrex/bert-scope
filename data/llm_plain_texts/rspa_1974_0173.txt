tldr: The authors studied the effect of fold geometry on the plastic deformation modes in polyethylene single crystals. They observed a marked dependence of stress-induced slip, twinning, and martensitic transformation on fold geometry. The differences in deformation behavior of adjacent fold sectors could be explained by the orientation of molecular folds with respect to the tensile axis.
