tldr: Samuel Hunter Christie's report on Michael Faraday's experiments investigates the identity of electricities from different sources, such as common and voltaic electricity. The author demonstrates that although the effects of these electricities may differ in degree, they share common properties like attraction and repulsion, evolution of heat, magnetism, chemical decomposition, and physiological phenomena. The experiments also show that the magnetical effect of a given quantity of common electricity is independent of the surface over which it is spread and is proportional to the absolute quantity of electricity. This supports the conclusion that electricity, regardless of its source, is identical in nature.
