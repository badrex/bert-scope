tldr: This study investigates the nucleation and growth of twins in dislocation-free zinc crystals using transmission electron microscopy. The critical resolved shear stress for twin nucleation and the mechanism of twin growth are discussed, along with dislocation reactions at twin boundaries, basal glide, and fracture in the twin. The differences between twinning in bulk crystals and dislocation-free whiskers and platelets are also examined.
