tldr: This article presents a graphical method for solving high-angle fire problems in artillery. The method accounts for the variation in air density and resistance, allowing for the determination of projectile trajectories. The process involves using five curves and a series of constructions to find the desired values. This method provides a practical and efficient way to solve complex problems in ballistics.
