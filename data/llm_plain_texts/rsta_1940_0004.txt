tldr: This article explores the behavior of semidiurnal tides in narrow oceans using a series solution method based on the angular width of the ocean. The author develops a mathematical model to analyze the tides and provides a method for solving the differential equations involved. The study focuses on the relationship between the ocean's width, depth, and tidal behavior, offering insights into the complex dynamics of ocean tides.
