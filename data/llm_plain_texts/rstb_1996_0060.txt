tldr: This article explores the effects of thelytokous worker reproduction on kin-selection and conflict in the Cape honeybee, Apis mellifera capensis. The author develops a model to show how kin-selection operates under thelytokous worker reproduction and uses the hypothesis to interpret the behavioral and biological peculiarities of the Cape honeybee. The study highlights the differences in kin-structure and reproductive values of males and females in thelytokous and arrhenotokous populations.
