tldr: This article discusses the phenomenon of reciprocal innervation, where one muscle of an antagonistic couple relaxes while its opponent contracts. The author investigates this process in various muscles and joints, including the elbow and knee, and explores its implications for both reflex actions and movements initiated via the cerebral hemispheres. The study contributes to a better understanding of muscle coordination and motor control.
