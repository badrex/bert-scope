tldr: This article discusses the challenges of subsidence in southeastern England and proposes the construction of a flood defense barrier across the Thames estuary. The authors evaluate various barrier designs and sites, ultimately recommending the rising sector gate type of barrier for its reliability and effectiveness in protecting London from dangerous surge tides. The study also outlines the organization and methods of the investigation, including the use of physical and mathematical models.
