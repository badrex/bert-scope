tldr: The authors studied the reactions of ethynyl radicals with hydrocarbons, focusing on addition-elimination reactions. They found that ethynyl radicals can abstract hydrogen atoms, displace hydrogen atoms, and displace other radicals in hydrocarbon systems. These findings are significant for understanding the formation and reactions of polyalkynes in flames and pyrolysis of hydrocarbons.
