tldr: The author studied the inheritance patterns in parthenogenetic generations and found that they resemble those of mid-parents. This discovery has implications for understanding the physiological causes of heredity and variation. The study also includes observations on the genus Onygena, a group of fungi that grow on animal materials like feathers, hair, and horns.
