  - Propagation of electric waves
tldr: The authors studied the diurnal variations of natural electric waves and their propagation around the Earth. They found that these waves are more frequent and intense during nighttime hours. The authors also investigated the phenomenon of a lull in electric wave activity at sunrise and sunset, which they attributed to changes in the propagation of electric waves through the atmosphere.
