tldr: The authors propose a new choice of weighting factors for N-variable rational polynomial approximants, ensuring that the approximants are covariant under changes of relative scale of the variables. This choice of weights provides a truly symmetrical set of equations and extends the covariance group of diagonal Pade approximants, potentially improving convergence and accuracy in certain regions of the variable space.
