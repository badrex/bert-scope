tldr: This article investigates the existence and properties of elastic waves at the interface of two solids, specifically focusing on Rayleigh waves. The author demonstrates that a wave of the Rayleigh type can exist when the velocity of distortional waves in the two media is the same, but not if the wave velocities are significantly different. The study has implications for understanding the energy of earthquakes and seismic disturbances.
