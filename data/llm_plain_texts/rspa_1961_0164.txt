tldr: The authors developed a water-model technique to study the path of jets in fluids with different densities. They injected a jet of magnetite slurry into a transparent box filled with water to observe the trajectory under the influence of density differences. The study provides a method to predict the axes of heterogeneous jet systems and compares the predicted results with observations in the water model, offering valuable insights for combustion engineering.
