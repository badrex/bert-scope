tldr: Edward Sabine conducted experiments to determine the ratio of magnetic forces acting on a horizontally suspended needle in Paris and London. He used needles from Professor Hansteen and Dollond, and performed the experiments at various locations. The results showed that the horizontal directive force in Paris was greater than in London, with a ratio of 1068:1000. The intensity of the directive force on the dipping needle was found to be slightly greater in London than in Paris.
