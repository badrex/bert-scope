tldr: The article investigates the levels of inositol metabolites in normal myeloid blast cells and how they change during their differentiation into monocytes. The researchers found that inositol metabolites play a significant role in myeloid cell differentiation, with notable changes occurring during the process. This study provides insights into the complex pattern of inositol metabolites in human cells and their potential role in cell differentiation.
