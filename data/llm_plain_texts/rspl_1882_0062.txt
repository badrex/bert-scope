tldr: The authors, Warren De La Rue and Hugo Muller, conducted experiments on electric discharges using a chloride of silver battery. They observed that the pressure of least resistance for a given gas varies with the vessel's dimensions. They also found that the dark space near the negative in electric discharges is less bright but not completely dark, as they captured a photographic image of the dark discharge. Lastly, they studied the effects of palladium terminals on gas deposition and release, discovering a volatile hydrogen alloy of palladium.
