tldr: The authors conducted optical studies on the biochemical events in the electric organ of Electrophorus. They discovered that electrical stimulation causes changes in fluorescence, non-specific light scattering, and absorption at around 420 nm. The excitation and emission spectra of the tissue identify the reduction of DPN as the cause of the fluorescence changes. The study supports the view that the sequence of events on stimulation of the electric organ involves changes in internal ionic concentrations, activation of the sodium pump, and activation of glycogenolysis to restore the ATP/ADP ratio.
