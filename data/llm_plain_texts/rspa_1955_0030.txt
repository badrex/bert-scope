tldr: This article investigates the friction and mechanical properties of solid krypton, finding that the friction is nearly independent of load and that the solid is extremely soft at temperatures near the melting point. The frictional behavior is similar to that of ice, and the low friction near the melting point is attributed to the formation of a liquid film. The article also discusses the hardness of solid krypton and its temperature dependence, comparing it to other solid rare gases and metals.
