tldr: 'This paper discusses the management and coordination of biotechnology in the UK from 1980 to 1988. It examines the recommendations made by the Spinks Report and the government's response, which led to the establishment of Celltech and the creation of a loose coordinating committee. The paper also highlights the challenges faced in coordinating biotechnology research and development across different government departments and research councils.'
