tldr: The authors studied the process of fragmentation in Lineus gesserensis, a type of marine worm. They found that the zones of fission coincide with the external markings on the worm's body. The process of fission involves the digestive fluids of the alimentary tract dissolving the tissues of the body-wall, followed by the growth of intestinal epithelium and the formation of external grooves. The opposing forces of the intestinal outgrowth and body-wall cause atrophy and disintegration of the outermost cells. The ruptured surfaces are covered by intestinal outgrowth and connective tissue proliferation, aiding in the healing of the fragments. The process of fission has relationships to sexual reproduction.
