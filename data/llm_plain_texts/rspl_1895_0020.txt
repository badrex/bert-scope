tldr: The authors investigate the stability of a hollow annular vortex in an infinite perfect liquid and the effect of an electric charge on the steady motion and stability of such a vortex. They find that the periods of these vibrations are real and that the energy of the vortex varies as the square of its velocity. The method used throughout the investigation is to refer the circumstances of the motion to toroidal co-ordinates.
