tldr: This article presents a case study of a boy who survived without food for an extended period. The boy, James Jackson, lived without eating or drinking, only washing his mouth with water. He experienced a fever and a shaking body, similar to paralysis. During this time, he had no bowel movements or urination. The boy eventually regained health but still had limited use of one limb. The case was documented by Patrick Blair, James Jackson, Elizabeth Bell, Charles Browne, and Gilbert Anthone.
