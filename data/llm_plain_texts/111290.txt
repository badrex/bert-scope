tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the functions and interactions of the vagus and spinal accessory nerves. They discovered that the spinal accessory nerve provides most of the motor fibers in the vagus nerve, which control the movement of the larynx, heart, and stomach. The study also found that the motor fibers distributed to the heart and stomach are mainly nucleated or "Remak" fibers.
