tldr: The authors, Udwadia and Kalaba, respond to Bucy's comments on their paper about equations of motion for non-holonomically constrained systems. They clarify the differences and equivalences between the Lagrange, Gibbs-Appell, and their own equations, emphasizing that all are different yet equivalent ways of stating D'Alembert's principle. They also address Bucy's incorrect statements about Gauss's principle and the importance of their work in providing useful results for practical situations.
