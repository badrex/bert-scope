tldr: This article discusses the chemical heterogeneity in the Earth's mantle and the nonlinear nature of contamination in magma chambers. Contamination of magmas by crustal materials can explain differences in trace element and isotopic features of basalts, which have been used as evidence for mantle heterogeneity. The effects of contamination on the composition of erupted products are not linear and can persist even after active contamination has ceased. The article emphasizes the importance of understanding contamination processes to accurately interpret the chemistry of the Earth's mantle.
