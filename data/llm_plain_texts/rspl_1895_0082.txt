tldr: This article compares the properties and structures of phylloporphyrin, a derivative of chlorophyll, and hæmatoporphyrin, a derivative of haemoglobin. Both substances share similarities in their formulae, physical properties, and absorption spectra, suggesting a close relationship between them. The authors discuss the differences and similarities between the two substances, including their color, solubility, and behavior in solutions, and explore the possibility of converting one into the other or obtaining a common derivative.
