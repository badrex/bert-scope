tldr: The authors conducted experiments using a shock tube to study the drag coefficient of a sphere in a non-stationary flow. They found that the obtained values for the sphere's drag coefficient were significantly larger than those obtained in a similar steady flow case. This research provides important information for predicting the trajectories of solid particles in various engineering applications, such as flows behind shock waves and solid propellant rockets.
