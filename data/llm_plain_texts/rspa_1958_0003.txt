tldr: The authors apply many-body perturbation theory to calculate the correlation energy of a free-electron gas. They find that the theory is adequate in the long-range limit but inadequate in the short-range limit. By carrying the calculation to the next lowest order, they improve the accuracy and provide numerical results that agree with Bohm and Pines' theory.
