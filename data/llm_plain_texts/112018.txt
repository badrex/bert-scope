tldr: This article compares the properties of chlorophyll and biliverdin, two green pigments found in plants and bile, respectively. The author, G.G. Stokes, finds that chlorophyll is a mixture of four substances, two green and two yellow, while biliverdin lacks the distinctive absorption bands and fluorescence of chlorophyll. The study concludes that chlorophyll and biliverdin are not identical, and their differences are explained by their distinct chemical compositions and properties.
