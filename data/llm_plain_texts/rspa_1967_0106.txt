tldr: The authors explore the connection between communication processes and epidemic processes, demonstrating that epidemic theory can be applied to study information transmission within populations. They introduce the concept of stability in epidemic processes and discuss the role of information retrieval processes in facilitating effective contact between susceptibles and infectives. The authors also apply Pontryagin's maximum principle to achieve optimal control of epidemic processes and establish the relationship between stability in epidemic processes and Lyapunov stability.
