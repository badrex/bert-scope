tldr: The author, Arthur Cayley, presents a new approach to the analytical theory of the conic and the decomposition of quadric functions. He introduces a formula for transforming a given quadric function into a decomposable form, which is the basis for solving various geometrical questions involving conic sections. The author also demonstrates how this formula simplifies in specific cases, such as when tangents are drawn to a conic from a point with double contact.
