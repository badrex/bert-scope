tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the adiabatic relations of ethyl oxide, focusing on the behavior of ether in the gaseous state. They used a modified Kundt's process to measure the velocity of sound in the liquid or gas and attempted to deduce the true position of the curves for the adiabatic expansion of gaseous ether. The study aimed to provide a better understanding of the adiabatic relations of gases and liquids, which could have implications for various scientific applications.
