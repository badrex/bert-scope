tldr: This article discusses a discussion on immunological tolerance led by Sir Macfarlane Burnet. It defines the concept of immunological tolerance and its applications in immunological systems, including red-cell and tissue transplantation immunity. The article also explores the implications of tolerance, such as its specificity and its role in specific inhibition of immunological reactions. It highlights that tolerance represents a central failure of the immune response, distinguishing it from other immunological phenomena.
