tldr: The authors developed a vacuum spectrometer for long wave-length X-rays, which provides high intensity radiation and accurate angular measurements of crystal reflection. The instrument uses a Seeman form of spectrometer with a fixed crystal, allowing for higher intensity spectra and eliminating the need for a vacuum-tight bearing for rotating the crystal. The spectrometer has been used to study reflection and diffraction phenomena, as well as to measure wave-lengths and intensities in the spectral region from 1 to 900 Å.
