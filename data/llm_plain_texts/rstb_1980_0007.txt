tldr: The article discusses the mechanism of antigenic drift in the influenza virus, focusing on the sequence changes in the haemagglutinin of variants selected with monoclonal hybridoma antibodies. The study finds that a single change in the amino acid sequence of the haemagglutinin polypeptide is associated with the loss of ability to bind the monoclonal antibody used in their selection. This suggests that antigenic drift is due to the selection of mutant virus particles with altered antigenic determinants and a growth advantage in the presence of antibody.
