tldr: The author investigates the spectrum of oxygen using spectroscopy and discovers that a continuous spectrum can be produced at low temperatures. This finding supports the theory that molecular structure, rather than molecular disturbance, is responsible for the different orders of spectra. The author also discusses the origin of channelled space and line spectra, and proposes possible explanations for their formation.
