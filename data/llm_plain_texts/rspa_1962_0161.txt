tldr: This paper investigates gravitational waves from axi-symmetric isolated systems using methods of expansion in negative powers of a radial coordinate. The authors show that the mass of a system is constant if there is no news, and if there is news, the mass decreases monotonically. The study also explores the significance of non-linearities in the equations and the distinction between near-field and radiative wave transfers in gravitational waves.
