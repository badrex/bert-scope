tldr: The authors develop a perturbation theory for electron optics, introducing characteristic functions to analyze the effects of perturbations on electron-optical systems. They apply this theory to calculate geometrical, chromatic, and mixed aberrations in electron lenses and electron-optical instruments with curved axes, providing a foundation for understanding and improving electron microscopy and related technologies.
