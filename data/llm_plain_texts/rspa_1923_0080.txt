tldr: The authors studied the effect of co-precipitating various oxides with nickel oxide on the catalytic activity of the reduced nickel. They found that small amounts of oxides like alumina, iron, magnesium, and silicon increased the activity of the nickel catalyst, while larger amounts decreased it. The main reason for this is the increased surface area of the nickel due to the presence of the voluminous admixed oxides, which prevent the nickel particles from coalescing during reduction.
