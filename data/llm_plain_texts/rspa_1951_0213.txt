tldr: The authors conducted experiments on thermal neutron diffraction by single crystals and demonstrated that accurate comparison of structure factors can be made using cylindrical or pillar crystals. They discussed the use of single crystals for neutron crystallography, extending the field of structure analysis beyond the limitations of powder methods. The study also explored the effects of crystal thickness and mosaic spread on diffraction patterns and provided insights into the practical applications and limitations of this technique.
