article, which discusses the protein selection and avoidance strategies of contemporary and ancestral foragers. The article highlights the importance of understanding the upper safe limit of protein intake during pregnancy and its potential impact on the diet and behavior of early hominids. The following unresolved issues are identified:

1. Is the protein threshold real and demographically significant in modern human foraging populations?
2. If the protein threshold exists, does it also affect pregnant female chimpanzees?
3. What are the consequences of this threshold for the diet and behavior of early hominids?

The article suggests that understanding these unresolved issues requires further input from specialists in the fields of human and primate nutrition.
