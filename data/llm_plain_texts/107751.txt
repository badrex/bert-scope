tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effects of freezing on brain and egg molecules. They found that freezing a frog's brain resulted in its death and caused significant changes in the brain's structure. The author also froze a pullet's egg and observed changes in its molecular structure, comparing it to the changes in the brain. These experiments provided insights into the impact of freezing on living tissues and the potential for life restoration after freezing.
