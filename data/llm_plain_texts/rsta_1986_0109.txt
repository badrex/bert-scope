tldr: The article discusses novel techniques of non-destructive examination and validation using optically generated thermal waves for imaging. It explains the generation of thermal waves through the absorption of modulated optical power and their interaction with thermal discontinuities. The article explores applications in material inspection, such as seam inspection, polymer inspection, and crack detection, using both transmission and reflection imaging methods.
