tldr: This article presents a new approach to the theory of thin elastic shells, focusing on the extension and flexure of cylindrical and spherical structures. The author develops equations for calculating stresses and couples in these shapes, considering the effects of both bending and extension. The study provides a foundation for understanding the behavior of thin structures and their applications in engineering and design.
