tldr: The author, Robert Lee, conducted a detailed dissection of the nervous system of a young heifer's heart. He observed ninety ganglia on the anterior surface and numerous ganglia on the posterior surface. These findings demonstrate the extensive network of nerves and ganglia in the heart, which are essential for its proper functioning. The accompanying drawings provide a visual representation of the nervous structures on the heart's surface.
