tldr: This article discusses the breakdown of synthetic organic compounds in water through biological processes. It examines the removal of over 200 substances during biological treatment and categorizes them based on their degradability. The authors also explore the significance of biodegradability in relation to water pollution and the potential environmental impact of resistant compounds.
