tldr: This study investigates the effects of gamma irradiation from radium on cell division in tissue culture. The research shows that there is a threshold of intensity and duration of exposure, below which no significant impact on cell division is observed. The findings also reveal that after certain exposure durations, cell division returns to normal levels, while longer exposures result in permanent damage to cells.
