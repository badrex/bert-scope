tldr: This review discusses the pericellular environment and its regulation in vertebrate tissues, focusing on connective tissue cells, cell proliferation, and the synthesis of the extracellular matrix. The author highlights the different types of connective tissue components, including collagen, elastic fibers, and glycosaminoglycans, and their roles in various tissues. The review also explores factors that control the synthesis of these matrix components and the means by which they stimulate fibroblast proliferation and connective tissue synthesis.
