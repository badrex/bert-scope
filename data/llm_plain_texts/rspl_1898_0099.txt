tldr: The author discovered that a normal, healthy eye can see multiple images of a single point under certain conditions. This phenomenon is likely due to the cellular structure of the eye's lenses and the associated membranes. The author describes various experiments and observations, including using different light sources and lenses, to study this effect and its potential causes.
