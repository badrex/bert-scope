tldr: The study provides a detailed description of the distribution of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in the adult rat brain using specific immunocytochemical detection. NOS was found in a widespread distribution in various brain regions, confirming earlier histochemical studies and suggesting its potential role in affecting the function of various neurotransmitter-specific systems. The possible implications of NOS in the regulation of the cerebrospinal fluid system and cerebral blood circulation are discussed.
