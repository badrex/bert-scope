tldr: The study investigates the effects of unilateral X-ray sterilization on mice ovaries. It found that the untreated ovary undergoes compensatory hypertrophy, increasing its size and function to compensate for the sterilized ovary. This discovery provides insights into the mechanisms controlling follicular development and reproductive function.
