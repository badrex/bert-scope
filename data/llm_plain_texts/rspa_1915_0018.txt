tldr: The authors investigate the laws of series spectra and calculate weighted means for spectral lines. They discuss the accuracy of these means and propose a method to obtain a nearly accurate mean free from errors. The study focuses on the applicability of the method, the accuracy of individual lines, and the values of spectral limits.
