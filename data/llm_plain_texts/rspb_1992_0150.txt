tldr: This study investigates the role of inward currents, specifically Na and it, in controlling and stabilizing pacemaker frequency in rabbit sino-atrial node cells. The researchers found that these currents play a crucial role in maintaining pacemaker frequency stability against changes induced by altering other conductances. The Noble-DiFrancesco-Denyer model was refined to better understand the balance between these currents and their impact on pacemaker activity.
