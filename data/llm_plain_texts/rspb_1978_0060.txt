tldr: This article discusses the genetics and functions of the H-2 system, the major histocompatibility system in mice. The H-2 system is a complex of at least ten loci that control immune responses and are involved in various aspects of immune function, including graft rejection, lymphocyte transformation, and regulation of immune responses to different antigens. The H-2 system is also linked to the T/t complex, which controls embryonic and spermatozoal differentiation. The article highlights the complexity and polymorphism of the major histocompatibility system and its importance in understanding immune responses and genetic variation in mice.
