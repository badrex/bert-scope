tldr: This study analyzes the atmospheric electric potential at Kew from selected days between 1898 to 1904. The author found that the diurnal inequalities in potential gradient are mostly smooth, with two distinct daily maxima and minima. The study also examines the influence of various meteorological elements on the potential gradient and compares the results with older data and other stations in Europe.
