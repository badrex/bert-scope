tldr: 'The study investigates the cell-specific expression of the a9 n-ACh receptor subunit in auditory hair cells using single-cell reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The research finds that the a9 subunit is expressed in inner hair cells and outer hair cells, supporting the hypothesis that it contributes to calcium-permeable ionotropic ACh receptors.'
