tldr: This article investigates the process of multilayer formation and structure, focusing on the deposition mechanisms. The authors explore the deposition ratio, the role of surface irregularities, and the behavior of multilayers on wire gauze. They also examine the relationship between multilayers and soap films, and discuss the factors affecting the stability and properties of these films.
