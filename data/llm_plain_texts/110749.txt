tldr: The author, Joseph Toynbee, investigates the non-vascular tissues in animals and their unique mode of organization and nutrition. He examines three classes of non-vascular tissues, including articular cartilage, cornea, and epidermoid appendages, and demonstrates that these tissues can be nourished without the presence of blood vessels within their substance. This discovery has implications for understanding the growth and development of these tissues and their role in animal physiology.
