tldr: The authors, H. Davenport and D. J. Lewis, investigate the solubility of systems of simultaneous additive equations in N unknowns. They establish conditions for the existence of solutions in integers and p-adic integers, providing insights into Waring's problem and the Hardy-Littlewood method.
