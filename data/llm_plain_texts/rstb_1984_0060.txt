tldr: This study investigates the direct effects of sulphur dioxide on trees, focusing on factors that influence their sensitivity to the pollutant. The authors discuss the impact of factors such as crown volume, wind velocity, sulphur uptake, supply of nutrients and water, genetic variability, and pollution regime on tree sensitivity to SO2. They also explore the physiological, biochemical, and ecological reactions of trees to SO2 exposure, emphasizing the importance of understanding these effects for forest management and air quality improvement.
