tldr: 'William Herschel discusses his observations and theories on the construction of the heavens and the formation of star clusters. He proposes that stars form clusters due to mutual attraction and that these clusters can have various shapes and sizes. He also considers the role of projectile forces and the balance of the universe in preserving and renewing star clusters.'
