tldr: This article investigates the effects of tensile stress on the susceptibility of various rock specimens, including magnetite, and how it changes their magnetic properties. The author found that the susceptibility of these rocks varies significantly under tensile stress, and the maximum increase in permeability occurs at different magnetic forces for each type of rock. The results provide insights into the behavior of magnetic materials under stress and have implications for geophysics and engineering applications.
