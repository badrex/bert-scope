revised_title: Oceanic Volcanism and the Structure of Earth: A Plate Tectonics Perspective
semantic_tags:
  - Plate tectonics
  - Oceanic volcanism
  - Mantle convection
  - Sea-floor spreading
  - Volcanic regimes
tldr: This article discusses the variation of volcanic products and processes within the oceanic environment, focusing on the three major volcanic regimes: axial zones of oceanic ridges, linear fractures, and island groups. The authors propose that these regimes can be explained by the plate tectonics theory, which involves mantle convection, sea-floor spreading, and the creation of new oceanic crust. They examine the petrochemical data and structural settings of these volcanic regimes, providing insights into the understanding of Earth's structure and the formation of oceanic crust.
