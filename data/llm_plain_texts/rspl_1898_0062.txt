tldr: The authors developed a method to determine the magnetic susceptibility of rocks by comparing the susceptibility of small rock samples with that of a liquid of known susceptibility. They used this method to measure the magnetic properties of various rock specimens, providing a basis for understanding the influence of magnetic rocks on the Earth's magnetic field.
