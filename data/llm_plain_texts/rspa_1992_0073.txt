tldr: The author investigates the motion of Earth satellites in an oblate atmosphere with a diurnal density variation and a variable density scale height. They derive expressions for the changes in orbital parameters due to air drag and examine the effects of atmospheric oblateness and variable density scale height on near-circular orbits. This study provides insights into the reinforcing or counterbalancing effects of these factors on satellite orbits.
