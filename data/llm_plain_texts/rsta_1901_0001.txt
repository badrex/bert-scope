tldr: The author investigates the kinetic theory of planetary atmospheres and the effects of axial rotation on molecular distribution. They discuss the conditions of atmospheric permanence and the critical velocity-ratio, considering the escape of molecules from planets. The study also explores the modification of Boltzmann-Maxwell distribution to account for axial rotation and its implications on planetary atmospheres.
