tldr: The author develops a general phenomenological theory of capillary excess or surface viscosities, considering momentum balance in the neighborhood of a fluid phase boundary. The theory introduces four surface viscosity coefficients and provides a foundation for understanding interfacial rheology and momentum transport in two-phase systems.
