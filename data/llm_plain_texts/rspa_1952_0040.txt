tldr: The authors investigated the infra-red and Raman spectra of diacetylene to understand its vibrational spectrum and bond properties. They discovered new assignments for the vibrational spectrum, which helped explain the observed overtone and combination bands. The study also led to a more accurate value for the C-C stretching force constant, resolving the previous force-constant anomaly in diacetylene's properties.
