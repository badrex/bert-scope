tldr: The authors study the slowly varying solitary waves in deep fluids, using an asymptotic analysis to determine the amplitude and phase of the wave to second order in the perturbation parameter. They find that the amplitude of the solitary wave is determined by conservation of 'energy', while'mass' is conserved by the development of a shelf behind the solitary wave. The results are interpreted from conservation laws and the effects of damping are considered.
