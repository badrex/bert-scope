tldr: This article presents a unified theory of ultrasonic attenuation in superconductors, explaining the temperature variation of attenuation for both longitudinal and transverse waves. The theory considers the effects of electronic scattering and anisotropy of the Fermi surface and energy gap, providing a better understanding of the behavior of superconductors under ultrasonic waves.
