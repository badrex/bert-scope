tldr: The study investigates the evolution of reproductive systems in the Silene genus, focusing on the comparison of ITS sequences of 22 species. The research suggests that gynodioecy, which is the most common reproductive system within the genus, is proposed to be ancestral. Evolution towards hermaphroditism, associated with selfing, has occurred at least twice, in S. gallica and S. conica.
