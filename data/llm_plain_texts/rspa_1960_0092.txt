tldr: The authors measured the absorption cross-sections and oscillator strengths of calcium vapour's auto-ionization lines and absorption continua. They found that the atomic absorption cross-section at the series limit of the auto-ionization lines is double, and the absorption at shorter wavelengths becomes continuous. The results can be used to improve theoretical calculations of absorption coefficients and in astrophysical problems.
