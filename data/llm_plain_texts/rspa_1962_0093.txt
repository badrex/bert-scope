tldr: The authors developed a dynamical diffraction theory to explain the complex image contrast effects of dislocation lines and stacking faults in crystals observed through transmission electron microscopy. They incorporated anomalous absorption phenomena into the theory, which provided a better understanding of image features like extinction contours, stacking faults, and dislocation images.
