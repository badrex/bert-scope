tldr: The authors study the chemisorption of hydrogen on evaporated tungsten films and its relation to the catalytic parahydrogen conversion. They find that the chemisorption is reversible even at liquid-air temperatures and that the conversion proceeds through a chemical mechanism. The results provide insights into the stability of chemisorption and the mechanism of the catalytic parahydrogen conversion.
