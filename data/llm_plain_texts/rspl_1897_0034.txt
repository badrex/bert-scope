revised_title: Inertness of Argon and Helium in Passing Through Red-hot Metals
semantic_tags:
  - Gas properties
  - Inert gases
  - Metal chemistry
  - Experimental chemistry
  - Gas diffusion
tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine if helium or argon could pass through red-hot palladium, platinum, or iron. They found that neither gas could pass through any of these metals, even at high temperatures, further proving their inertness.
