tldr: The author examines the structure and relations of fossil plants from the coal measures, specifically focusing on Lyginodendron and Rachiopteris. They demonstrate that these plants represent the stem and petiole of the same fern, providing evidence for exogenous development in ferns as well as arborescent Lycopods and Calamites. This discovery sheds light on the anatomy and evolution of ancient plant life during the Carboniferous period.
