tldr: The author investigates the color relationship between certain exposed lepidopterous pupae and their surrounding surfaces. They found that pupae change color to match their surroundings, suggesting that this color adaptation is due to larval susceptibility during the pupation process. This discovery provides insight into the environmental adaptation of insects and their ability to blend in with their surroundings.
