tldr: Dr. Miles discusses his thoughts on electrical fire and luminous effluvia in a letter to Mr. Henry Baker. He considers various hypotheses, including the possibility that electrical and luminous effluvia are the same substance, and that fire can be mechanically produced from other bodies through collision or attrition. He also explores the role of the "subtle, active, elastic substance" proposed by Sir Isaac Newton in the process. Dr. Miles acknowledges that his understanding is limited and hopes for future experiments to shed light on this complex subject.
