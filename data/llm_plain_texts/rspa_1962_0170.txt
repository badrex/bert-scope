revised_title: Matrices and Complexes in Commutative Rings
semantic_tags:
  - Commutative algebra
  - Matrix theory
  - Algebraic geometry
  - Homological algebra
  - Koszul complex
tldr: The authors introduce a complex associated with a matrix in a commutative ring, generalizing the Koszul complex. They explore the properties of this complex and its applications to ideals defined by matrices, providing a theorem on unmixed ideals and a general theorem on rank for Noetherian rings.
