tldr: The author conducted experiments on the liquefaction and solidification of argon, a newly discovered gas. They found that argon has a higher density than other gases and can be liquefied at a lower temperature than oxygen. Argon can also be solidified, making it unique among so-called "permanent" gases. The author discusses the physical constants of argon and compares them to other permanent gases, such as carbon monoxide and oxygen.
