tldr: The authors study the braincase and dermal bones of Mesozoic pholidophorid and leptolepid fishes, which are at the base of the Teleostei. They provide a morphological series that illuminates problems of actinopterygian evolution and anatomy. The braincase of advanced leptolepids is teleost-like, while pholidophorids include forms with more primitive braincases. The study supports a monophyletic origin of extant teleost groups within the leptolepid grade and reveals several specializations in the braincase that relate pholidophorids to leptolepids and teleosts.
