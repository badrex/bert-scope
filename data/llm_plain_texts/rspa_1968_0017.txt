tldr: This study investigates the oxidation of benzene solutions of phenols using electron spin resonance. The authors found that the oxidation of phenols with a free para-position produces secondary radicals derived from dimeric and polymeric phenols. The ease of displacement of para-substituents can be determined using the flow technique. Various reaction products, including diphenoquinones and polymers, were identified.
