tldr: The author, John Dalton, discusses the behavior of gases in the atmosphere and how they mix and distribute in vertical columns. He explains the differences in density and temperature in various layers of the atmosphere and how gases diffuse through each other. The study of gas diffusion and distribution is essential for understanding the composition and behavior of the Earth's atmosphere.
