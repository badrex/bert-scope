tldr: This article explores the concept of echoic memory and its role in the auditory recency advantage. It discusses how recency effects in short-term memory are more pronounced when items are spoken rather than written, and how this advantage can be attributed to echoic memory. The author also reviews studies that challenge the echoic memory explanation and suggests that temporal distinctiveness may be a more general explanation for recency effects.
