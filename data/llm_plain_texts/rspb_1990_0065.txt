tldr: The study investigates the effect of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) X-gene product (HBxAg) on the expression of the surface antigen gene. The researchers found that HBxAg can increase the expression of HBsAg in transfected hepatoma cells, suggesting that this activity in vivo may contribute to the high level of HBsAg expression observed during natural infection.
