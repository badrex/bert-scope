tldr: The authors conducted a chemical analysis of the suprarenal capsules in Elasmobranch fishes and found that they contain a chromogen with the same chemical nature as that found in mammalian medulla. This discovery helps to understand the similarities and differences in the function and composition of suprarenal glands in different species.
