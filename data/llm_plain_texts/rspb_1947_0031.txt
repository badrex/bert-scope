tldr: The authors studied the properties and constitution of silk fibroin, focusing on its conversion into a water-soluble form and its relationship to denaturation. They found that fibroin contains no amide-nitrogen and that the water-soluble form is the native or renatured protein, while the original fibroin is considered denatured. The study also discusses aspects of protein and polypeptide chains as macromolecules and their denaturation process.
