tldr: This article examines the influence of small viscous effects on the solar wind, a stream of charged particles flowing from the Sun. The author analyzes the idealized, steady, one-fluid solar wind equations and finds that including viscosity has a significant impact on solutions far from the Sun. The study clarifies the relationship between different solutions and highlights the importance of considering viscous effects in solar wind theory.
