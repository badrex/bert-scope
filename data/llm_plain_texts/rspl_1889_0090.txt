tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the effect of the gas spectrum on the sensitivity of silver haloid salts used in photography. They employed various light sources and methods to create images of the gas spectrum and measured the density of the photographic plates. The results showed the sensitiveness of the plates to different parts of the spectrum and provided a basis for understanding the photographic process and improving photographic plates.
