tldr: The authors investigate the crystal structures of molecular complexes of 4:4'-dinitrodiphenyl with other 4- and 4:4'-substituted diphenyl compounds. They observe periodic errors and lattice faults in the crystal lattice, which cause diffuseness and elongation of spots in oscillation photographs. The authors discuss a possible explanation for these effects and analyze the diffraction patterns of the complex structures.
