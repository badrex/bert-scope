  - Nonlinear wave propagation
  - Vibrational relaxation

  - Sound attenuation
tldr: The authors study the shock-free flow field of a pulsating sphere in a vibrationally relaxing gas without viscosity and heat conduction. They use numerical integration of the exact equations to analyze the effects of nonlinearity, attenuation, dispersion, spherical spreading, and source compactness. The results provide insights into the behavior of sound waves in real gases and help assess the accuracy of approximate solutions.
