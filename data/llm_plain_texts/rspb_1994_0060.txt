tldr: This study investigates the environmental control of horn length dimorphism in the beetle Onthophagus acuminatus. The research shows that horn lengths of male progeny are determined by individual differences in body size and not by the horn lengths of their fathers. This supports theories on sexual selection that predict male ornaments will evolve to be reliable indicators of male quality. The findings also highlight the importance of incorporating studies of developmental mechanisms into analyses of morphological evolution.
