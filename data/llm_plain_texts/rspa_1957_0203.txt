tldr: The article presents a mathematical study of certain integrals involving Bessel functions that occur in hydrodynamical problems, particularly the movement of a planing wedge along a water surface. The author develops the mathematical theory of these integrals, evaluates them in closed form, and provides tables of their values. The study also discusses various properties, asymptotic expansions, and methods of computation for these integrals.
