tldr: 'The study found that nestling birds in species with low relatedness within a brood beg louder, as these calls attract more attention and increase the chances of being fed at the expense of quieter siblings. This behaviour is more common in species with high levels of mixed parentage and brood-parasitic birds, as the average relatedness among nestmates is lower in these cases.'
