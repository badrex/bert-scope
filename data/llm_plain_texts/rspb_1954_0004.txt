tldr: This study investigates the adaptation of yeast strains to galactose and how it affects their growth rates. The researchers found that some yeast strains can be trained to grow in galactose, but the adaptation is unstable and can revert when the strains are transferred to glucose. The study also explores the behavior of yeast strains during sporulation and how it relates to their galactose adaptation.
