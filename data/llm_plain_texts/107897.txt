tldr: The author examines the action of second surfaces of transparent plates on light and discovers that the quantity of polarized light contained in the transmitted pencil is equal to the quantity of light polarized at right angles in the reflected pencil. This phenomenon occurs at specific angles of incidence and has implications for understanding the behavior of light in transparent materials.
