tldr: The authors, C. E. Wynn-Williams, F. A. B. Ward, and Lord Rutherford, developed methods to improve the valve amplification system for detecting and recording single alpha-particles in the presence of powerful ionizing radiations. They describe the apparatus, methods, and precautions to reduce disturbances caused by alpha and beta particles. This advancement allowed for the study of alpha particles emitted by radioactive bodies and artificial disintegration phenomena.
