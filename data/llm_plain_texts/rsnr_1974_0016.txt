tldr: Edward Jenner, the discoverer of vaccination, made an unrelated observation about the cuckoo's behavior in bird nests. He was the first to accurately describe how the cuckoo ejects the host bird's offspring from the nest. Despite facing controversy and disbelief from other naturalists, his observation was eventually acknowledged and accepted by some experts in the field.
