tldr: In this paper, J.F.W. Herschel corrects an error in his previous publication on the parallax of fixed stars. He rectifies the mistake in the formula for computing the most advantageous times of year for observations on the parallax of a double star. The corrected formula is provided, and it is noted that the differences between the correct and erroneous dates do not significantly impact the usefulness of observations made on the original plan.
