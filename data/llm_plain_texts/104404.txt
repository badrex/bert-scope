tldr: The author, Christopher Warrick, describes a new method for treating ascites, a buildup of fluid in the abdomen, which involves injecting a mixture of warm claret and Bristol water into the abdominal cavity after removing the excess fluid. This method aims to close up ruptured lymphatics and prevent a relapse of the disease. The author also suggests that this method may be useful in treating hydrocele, hydrops pectoris, and other related conditions.
