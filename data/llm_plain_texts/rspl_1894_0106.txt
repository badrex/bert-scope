tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the rotation of the electric arc and its impact on light standards. They discovered that the effective luminosity of the arc is not constant or uniform, and a periodic phenomenon accompanies the appearance of a bright spot in the arc's crater. This phenomenon could interfere with the use of the arc as a standard of light source. The authors are further examining this phenomenon to determine its nature and find practical conditions under which it is absent or negligible.
