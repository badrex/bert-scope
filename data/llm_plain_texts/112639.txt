tldr: The author conducted a study on the growth and development of bird bones, specifically focusing on the transition from marrow-filled bones to air-filled bones. The study involved examining various bird species at different stages of growth, observing the changes in bone structure and the presence of air and marrow. The findings provide insights into the avian skeletal system and the role of air-sacs in birds.
