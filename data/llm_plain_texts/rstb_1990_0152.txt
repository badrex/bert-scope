tldr: Researchers discovered that in colonial radiolaria, a type of marine protozoa, strontium sulfate crystals are deposited within a cytoplasmic envelope. The unusual crystal morphology suggests that the process of crystallization is influenced by the surface chemistry at the organo-mineral interface. The study provides insights into the biological control of mineral deposition and biomineralization in various scientific fields.
