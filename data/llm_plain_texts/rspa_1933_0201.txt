tldr: The authors investigated the synthesis and properties of dihydrostibacridine, an antimony analogue of the acridine series. They prepared various derivatives of dihydrostibacridine and studied their reactions and properties. The research involved the use of the Bart-Schmidt process, Grignard reactions, and the synthesis of halogenated and alkylated derivatives. The findings contribute to the understanding of antimony compounds and their potential applications in organic chemistry.
