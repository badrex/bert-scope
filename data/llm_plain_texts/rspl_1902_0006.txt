tldr: This article presents a method for determining the equilibrium configurations of a rotating liquid cylinder. The author develops a transformation technique to write down the potential by transforming the equation of the boundary. The study investigates linear series of circles and ellipses, finding that exchange of stabilities occurs at a specific point. The configurations evolve from pear-shaped forms to those resembling a soda-water bottle and eventually a tennis-racquet shape.
