tldr: Researchers have successfully demonstrated the external switching of an intrinsic optically bistable device using incoherent radiation. The device, made of an InSb etalon, was switched both on and off resonance using a photographic flashlamp. This discovery could lead to the development of real-time optically addressed spatial light modulators.
