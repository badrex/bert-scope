  - Reactor environments
tldr: The authors discuss the growth of diamond through chemical vapour deposition, focusing on the role of atomic hydrogen in mediating rates and maintaining a proper surface for growth. They describe the complex gas-phase reactions and energy flows in various reactor environments, and explore the mechanisms behind diamond nucleation and growth. The article also highlights the importance of understanding the energetics of diamond deposition processes.
