tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine if a spark could occur before the circuit of a voltaic battery was completed. Using a micrometer electrometer, the author found that a spark could not pass through a space of 50th of an inch, even with powerful voltaic batteries. This discovery challenged the findings of other scientists at the time and demonstrated the importance of accurate measurements in experimental research.
