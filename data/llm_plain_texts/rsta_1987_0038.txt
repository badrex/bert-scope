tldr: The JET project explores the behavior of resistively heated plasmas in the JET device, evaluating its potential for controlled nuclear fusion. The study focuses on plasma properties, density, confinement time, and plasma-wall interaction. The research aims to establish the conditions necessary for studying a reacting plasma, with the ultimate goal of achieving controlled nuclear fusion.
