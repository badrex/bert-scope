tldr: 'This article discusses the pioneering experiments conducted by W. G. Adams and R. E. Day on the effects of light on selenium. They discovered that exposure to light significantly reduces the electrical resistance of selenium, with the effect being most pronounced in the greenish-yellow and red portions of the spectrum. The authors also found that exposure to cold produces a similar change in selenium, suggesting that temperature changes play a role in the material's behavior. These findings laid the groundwork for future research in photoconductivity and the development of photovoltaic technologies.'
