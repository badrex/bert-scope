tldr: The author, Joseph Betts, observed and recorded the movements and positions of a comet in the sky over several days, using various instruments and methods. He then calculated the comet's trajectory and orbital elements, including its parabolic path and the time of perihelion. Although he did not determine the comet's period or predict its return, his observations and calculations provided valuable data for astronomers of the time.
