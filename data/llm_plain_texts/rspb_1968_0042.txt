tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the intracellular location of enzymes in Rhodopseudomonas spheroides. They found that certain enzymes, such as zinc protoporphyrin chelatase, S-adenosylmethionine-magnesium protoporphyrin methyltransferase, and succinic dehydrogenase, were associated with both chromatophores and non-pigmented particulate material, likely the cytoplasmic membrane. This study adds to the understanding of the nature and origin of chromatophores in photosynthetic bacteria.
