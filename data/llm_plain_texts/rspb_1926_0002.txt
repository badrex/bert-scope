tldr: This study examines the effect of very small electric currents on the growth rate of barley coleoptiles. The researchers found that a one-hour electrification had a significant positive effect on growth, with a probability of over 200:1. The study also discusses the importance of accurate statistical analysis to improve the accuracy of the method and reduce the impact of errors in the experiment.
