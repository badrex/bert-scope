tldr: The authors investigate the kinetics of electrode reactions involving electroactive adsorbed species using potentiodynamic techniques. They focus on the reduction of thin surface oxide films on noble metals, such as platinum, rhodium, iridium, and palladium. The study helps to understand the behavior of these reactions and provides insights into the potential applications of potentiodynamic methods for studying electrode kinetics.
