tldr: This article presents an experimental study on the adsorption of hydrogen on tungsten surfaces. The authors developed two methods to measure the efficiency of hydrogen adsorption and the accompanying heat changes. They found that the adsorption process is practically complete at low pressures, and the number of hydrogen molecules adsorbed is comparable to the total amount of gas in the apparatus. The results provide insights into the adsorption process and the interaction between hydrogen and tungsten surfaces.
