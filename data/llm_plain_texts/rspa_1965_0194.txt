revised_title: 'Classification of Non-Compact Real Simple Lie Groups and Lorentz Group'
semantic_tags:
  - Lie Groups
  - Group Representations
  - Automorphisms
  - Symmetry

tldr: The authors classify all non-compact real simple Lie groups, focusing on those containing the Lorentz group. They discuss the involutive automorphisms of compact real forms and the transformation of Lie algebras to obtain different real Lie groups. The study of these groups and their properties is essential for understanding the connections between symmetry, group representations, and algebraic geometry.
