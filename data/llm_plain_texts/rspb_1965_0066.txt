tldr: The article investigates the kinetics and equilibria of nitric oxide reactions with haemoproteins, specifically haemoglobin and myoglobin. The authors found that the extent of haem-haem interaction is inversely related to the rate of combination of the first ligand molecule, and determined the rate constants for the combination and dissociation of nitric oxide with haemoglobin and myoglobin. The competitive equilibrium constant for myoglobin between nitric oxide and carbon monoxide was also measured, providing valuable insights into the behavior of haemoproteins with different ligands.
