tldr: The author investigates the motion of ions in the presence of electromagnetic disturbances and finds that ions appear to drift in the direction of the waves. This phenomenon can lead to ionization of surrounding gas, creating a streaming of positive and negative ions and neutral molecules. The study supports the idea that radioactive substances may extract energy from the aether and radiate it back, affecting the surrounding environment.
