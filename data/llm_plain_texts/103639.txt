tldr: 'John Hadley observed the satellites of Jupiter and Saturn using a reflecting telescope. He saw the shadows of Jupiter's first and third satellites and discerned two belts within Saturn's ring. Hadley also noticed a dark line separating the two parts of the ring and observed the shadows of Jupiter's first, second, and third satellites passing over the planet's body.'
