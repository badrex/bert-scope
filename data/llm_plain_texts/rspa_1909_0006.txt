tldr: This article discusses the discovery of the isothermal layer of the atmosphere, a region where the temperature remains relatively constant with altitude. The author explains the phenomenon and its implications for atmospheric science, including the role of radiation and convection in maintaining temperature gradients. The isothermal layer has been observed in various locations around the world and is an important factor in understanding Earth's climate and weather patterns.
