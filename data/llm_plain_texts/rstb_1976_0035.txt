tldr: This article discusses the interpretation of variations in leaf water potential and stomatal conductance found in canopies in the field. The authors propose simple models to predict these variables from measurements of weather and plant variables, using parameters derived from occasional periods of measurement in the field. They emphasize the importance of understanding the relationship between leaf water potential, stomatal conductance, and environmental factors for better interpretation of plant properties.
