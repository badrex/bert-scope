tldr: This article investigates the photosensitised decomposition of nitrogen trichloride by chlorine, a chain reaction that is not affected by the illuminated surface or the total surface area. The addition of inert gases, such as helium, argon, nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide, decreases the reaction rate and quantum efficiency. The authors propose a mechanism involving chain termination by surface reactions and stabilization of energy-rich complexes by ternary collisions.
