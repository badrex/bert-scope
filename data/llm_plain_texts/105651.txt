tldr: In a letter to Benjamin Franklin, John Bartram describes his observation of a remarkable Aurora Borealis in Philadelphia. The event occurred on November 12, 1761, and was visible for several hours. Bartram inquired about whether the phenomenon was observed in London and if it could assist in philosophical inquiries. Franklin confirmed that a similar event was observed in London, 1000 leagues away, emphasizing the widespread nature of the phenomenon.
