tldr: The author presents corrections and additions to the memoir on the theory of reciprocal surfaces, focusing on the wave-lengths of spectral lines produced by the atmosphere and metals. He discusses the applicability of Kirchhoff's lines and the discrepancies between Angstrom's and Ditschei's measures. The author provides a general table of corrections and tables of the lengths of light-waves for the air and metals, as corrected by the quantities deduced from the table.
