tldr: This article explores the decomposition of ethylene when exposed to heat, resulting in the formation of acetylene and methane. The author examines the effects of rate of flow, area of heated surface, and dilution on the changes taking place. The study has implications for understanding the changes that occur in minerals deep within the Earth and the composition of water gas.
