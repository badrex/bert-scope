tldr: The author, John Nettis, observed and documented the various configurations and shapes of snow particles under different weather conditions. He used microscopes to study the intricate structures of snowflakes, which he found to be hexagonal in shape. Nettis discovered a wide variety of snowflake shapes, including hexagonal lamellae, oblong hexagonal particles, and slender hexagonal spiculae. His work provides a detailed account of the fascinating world of snowflake formations and their unique structures.
