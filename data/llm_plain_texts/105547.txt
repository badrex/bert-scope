tldr: In 1764, Dr. John Bevis received a letter from Mungo Murray, a skilled mathematician and shipbuilder, detailing his observations of the solar eclipse at Chatham. Murray confirmed the eclipse's annular phase and estimated the geographical position of Chatham relative to the eclipse's path. This information was valuable for understanding the eclipse's progression and the location of the Moon's shadow.
