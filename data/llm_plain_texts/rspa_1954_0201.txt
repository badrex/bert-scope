tldr: This article presents a mathematical approach to define and evaluate Feynman's integral over all paths, a concept used in quantum mechanics. The author develops a technique to define this integral for a free particle and extends it to cases with a potential independent of velocity. The article also discusses the properties and applications of the integral, including its connection to Green's functions.
