tldr: This article presents a method to examine the rate of chemical change in aqueous solutions by measuring the relative amounts of voltaic energy of electrolytes. The author investigates the effects of temperature, dilution, light, and agitation on the chemical change and concludes that the solution of potassic iodide and chlorine is highly unstable and sensitive to temperature changes, while the solution of potassic chloride and iodine is more stable. The method offers advantages over other methods due to its sensitivity, accuracy, and quick performance.
