tldr: The authors conducted magnetic susceptibility measurements on single crystals of cerous magnesium nitrate to determine the energies of the low-lying states and the coefficients of the crystalline potential. Their analysis, in terms of a crystal field of symmetry acting on one electron, provides a more accurate estimate of the energy of the first excited doublet, in reasonable agreement with the results of spin-lattice relaxation time measurements. The study highlights the importance of considering factors generally omitted from the theory of rare-earth salts for a more complete understanding of their properties.
