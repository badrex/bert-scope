tldr: 'This study investigates the electrical conductivity of echinoderm eggs and its relation to fertilization and artificial parthenogenesis. The author found that fertilized eggs have a higher electrical conductivity, indicating increased permeability to ions. This supports the theory that after fertilization, the egg surface becomes more permeable, playing a role in the development process.'
