tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the photographic transparency of various bodies and the photographic effects of metallic spectra obtained by means of the electric spark. They discovered that colorless bodies with equal powers of transmitting luminous rays have varying permeability to chemical rays. The author also found that diactinic solids maintain their diactinic power when liquefied or converted into vapor. The experiments involved using a quartz prism and various substances to test their absorbent action on chemical rays, with notable results on sapphire, topaz, mica, and other materials.
