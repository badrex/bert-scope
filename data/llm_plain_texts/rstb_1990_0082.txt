tldr: The article discusses the effects of acidic deposition on North American lakes using palaeolimnological evidence from diatoms and chrysophytes. It summarizes the nature and extent of recent acidification in different regions and the role of acidic deposition and other factors as causes of observed changes. The study finds that recent acidification has been caused by acidic deposition in the Adirondack Mountains, northern New England, Ontario, Quebec, and the Canadian Atlantic provinces, with the amount of inferred acidification correlating with the amount of S and N loading and the ability of watersheds and lakes to neutralize acid inputs.
