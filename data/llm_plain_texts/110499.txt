tldr: The author, Henry Fox Talbot, studied the optical properties of minute crystals formed by the evaporation of a borax-phosphoric acid solution. Using a polarizing microscope, he observed the formation of crosses and colored concentric rings in these crystals. He also discovered a new type of dichroism in crystals when examined with polarized light.
