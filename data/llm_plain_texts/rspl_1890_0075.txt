tldr: The author presents a method for creating a general tide table applicable for all time, allowing anyone with basic knowledge of the Nautical Almanac to compute tides for specific days. This method can also be used to create special tide tables for any year with relatively little effort. The author demonstrates the accuracy of this method using the complex and irregular tides of Aden as an example.
