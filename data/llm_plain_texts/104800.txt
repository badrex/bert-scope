tldr: The author, Charles Hamilton, describes a water-clock called the Tantalus Clepsydra. The device uses a constant water stream to move water through two vessels, which in turn move a balance and a series of pulleys to accurately measure time. The water-clock's design allows for precise timekeeping and can be used for various applications, including as a dial plate with hour and minute hands.
