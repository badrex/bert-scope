tldr: The authors discuss methods to improve the quality of images formed by annular apertures, focusing on radio-astronomy applications. They propose novel methods, including the use of electronic techniques, to correct the polar diagrams and reduce side lobes in the images. The authors also describe a method of rotating the aerial array electronically to simulate rotation and improve the image quality.
