tldr: 'The author describes a unique method of producing a large quantity of alkaline salt by burning rotten wood. The decayed wood turns into a good white alkali, which can be dissolved and evaporated to produce a clean, white salt. This method is different from traditional alkali extraction from ashes, as the wood itself melts and runs into hard salt lumps during burning. The author also discusses the possible reason behind this phenomenon, suggesting that the wood was struck by lightning, which altered its composition and allowed it to attract and retain the nitrous salt of the air.'
