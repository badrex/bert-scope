tldr: The author, Henry Philips, observed the differences in tidal times between new and full moons and at the quarters. He developed a method using a circular proportion to calculate the true time of tides, which could be useful for seamen and astronomers. This method takes into account the Moon's position and the time difference between spring and neap tides.
