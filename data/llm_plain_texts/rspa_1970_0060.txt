tldr: The authors investigated the spin-phonon interaction of nickel ion pairs in a perovskite crystal using acoustic paramagnetic resonance. They discovered that unexpected lines in the acoustic resonance spectrum were due to second nearest neighbour and more distant ion pairs. The exchange parameters for these pairs were deduced, and the mechanism for their spin-phonon interaction was found to be the single-ion process.
