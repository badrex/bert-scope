tldr: The authors propose a new vortex-sheet model for the mixing between two parallel streams, which involves a thin vortex sheet rolling up into an array of vortex cores. This model is described in detail and experimental evidence is analyzed to demonstrate its physical realism and potential applications. The model offers an alternative approach to traditional concepts of turbulent mixing and shear stresses, providing a foundation for further theoretical work and numerical solutions.
