tldr: The author investigates the condensation nuclei produced in gases by various agents, such as Röntgen rays, uranium rays, and ultra-violet light. They found that exposure to these agents causes the production of nuclei that require a certain degree of supersaturation for water to condense on them. The author also describes the apparatus and methods used to study these phenomena, including a cloud chamber for observing the expansion of gases.
