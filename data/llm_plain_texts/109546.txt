tldr: The author, Robert Woodhouse, discusses the benefits of using either analytical or geometrical methods independently in solving mathematical problems. He argues that blending the two methods can lead to ambiguity and confusion. Woodhouse provides examples of how purely analytical methods can be used to solve various mathematical problems, such as integrals, cubic equations, and series resolution. He concludes that the analytical method is preferable for investigating complex truths and solving intricate problems.
