tldr: The authors studied the spectrum of ionized tellurium (Te III) and analyzed its structure. They identified various energy levels and terms, and found that the atomic energy states of Te II and Te III had not been determined before. The study provides insights into the behavior of tellurium atoms under different conditions of ionization and temperature.
