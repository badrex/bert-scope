tldr: The authors studied the catalytic activity of tungsten in the conversion of parahydrogen. They found that the surface concentration of adsorbed oxygen affects the reaction rate. The oxygen not only reduces the available surface area for the reaction but also influences the reactivity of neighboring chemisorbed hydrogen. The authors also investigated the poisoning effect of adsorbed films of other gases, such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen, and ethylene, on the catalytic activity of tungsten.
