tldr: The study investigates the chromosome behavior and cytology in male ferrets and moles during the anoestrous period. It reveals the diploid chromosome numbers of 38 in moles and 34 in ferrets, and analyzes the chromosome behavior during mitosis and meiosis. The research provides insights into the cytological basis of sexual inactivity in males during the anoestrous period.
