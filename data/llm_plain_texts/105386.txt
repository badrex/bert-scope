tldr: The author, Peter Collinson, discusses the migration and habits of swallows. He argues against the belief that swallows do not migrate and instead live underwater during winter. He provides evidence from his own observations and those of others, including accounts of swallows found on ships and in other locations. He also mentions the behavior of swallows in Senegal, where they do not build nests but instead rest on the seashore. Collinson concludes that swallows are indeed birds of passage.
