tldr: The authors studied the photolysis of ozone by ultraviolet radiation and found that singlet molecular oxygen is a primary product of the process. They used a time-resolved flow technique and determined the absolute quantum yields for the formation of singlet molecular oxygen, providing insights into atmospheric chemistry and airglow studies.
