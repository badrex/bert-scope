tldr: The author analyzes the shape and internal structure of the Moon using harmonic analysis of available hypsometric data. They find that the Moon's surface contains significant harmonic terms, with the largest being of fourth order. The Moon's moments of inertia do not match a state of hydrostatic equilibrium, suggesting an asymmetric nonhomogeneous interior or ongoing internal processes. The study also highlights the importance of accurate measurements and the limitations of stereoscopic methods in determining the Moon's shape.
