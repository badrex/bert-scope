tldr: This study examines the water-conductivity of wood in deciduous trees and shrubs, focusing on the plasticity and variability of their structure. The author finds that deciduous trees have a higher specific conductivity than evergreens, and that their wood structure is more efficient and adaptable to their environment. This plasticity allows deciduous trees to thrive in various environments, including tropical regions with alternating seasons.
