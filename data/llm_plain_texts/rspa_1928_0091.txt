tldr: The authors analyze electron emission in intense electric fields, extending previous theories and incorporating Sommerfeld's metal physics. They show that a single set of free electrons, distributed according to Fermi-Dirac statistics, can explain both strong-field and thermionic emission. The study provides a more accurate understanding of electron behavior in electric fields and contributes to the development of better technologies.
