tldr: The author studied the electronic spectra of free methyl and methylene radicals, providing insights into their structures and confirming their presence in various chemical reactions. The research involved observing the Rydberg series of bands in the vacuum ultraviolet region and analyzing isotope shifts to identify the carrier molecules. This work helped to understand the fine structure and chemical bonding of these radicals.
