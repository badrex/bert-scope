tldr: The author studied the variation of ribulose isomerase activity in Bacillus lactis aerogenes during adaptation to D-arabinose. They found that small enzyme activity was detected in unadapted cells, which increased more than 100-fold when the cells were adapted. The pattern of increasing enzyme activity in intact cells during the early stages of division was different from the pattern expected if mutation and selection were responsible for the adaptive response. The results were confirmed by measuring the rate of pentose consumption by the bacteria.
