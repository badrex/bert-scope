tldr: This article explores the behavior of Heisenberg's S-matrix in quantum mechanics, focusing on a system with a fixed center and internal states. The author discusses the discontinuous changes in matrix elements at threshold energy values for inelastic scattering and suggests a method to represent these changes as non-analytic. The study also investigates the connection between resonance scattering and spontaneous emission, as well as the use of the matrix for determining spectral line intensities.
