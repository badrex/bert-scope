tldr: This article discusses the importance of studying tooth morphology and dental evidence in understanding hominid evolution and systematics. The author emphasizes the value of tooth enamel as a morphological marker and its potential to provide insights into dietary adaptations and social behavior of early hominids. The article also highlights the need for systematic studies to identify patterns of morphological variation and assess the taxonomic significance of these differences in the fossil record.
