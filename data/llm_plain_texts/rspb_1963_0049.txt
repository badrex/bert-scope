tldr: The authors studied the lipids of Arum maculatum spadices, a site of intense metabolic activity, and discovered various lipids such as ubiquinone, carotenoids, and a new alcohol called spadicol. The high concentration of ubiquinone matches the high cytochrome oxidase activity of the spadix, while the low content of plastoquinone indicates little photosynthetic activity in the mature spadix.
