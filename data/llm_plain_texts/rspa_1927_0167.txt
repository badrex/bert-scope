tldr: The authors investigated the catalytic activity of nickel in the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen. They discovered a new method to test whether a metallic surface is covered with an oxide layer by measuring the accommodation coefficient of hydrogen. The results showed that the rate of formation of water in contact with a nickel surface covered with a thin layer of oxide is similar to the rate in contact with visibly oxidized metal under the same conditions.
