tldr: The authors investigate the effective conductivity of a granular material with randomly arranged particles in contact with each other and immersed in a connected uniform matrix. They focus on the case of high conductivity particles and derive an approximate expression for the mean flux in the case of touching particles. The results are applicable to conduction of heat through packed beds of metal particles in water or electricity through piles of carbon particles in air.
