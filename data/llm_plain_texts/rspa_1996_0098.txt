tldr: This article presents a new transform technique to model the absorption response of an infinite chain of metal cylinders at optical and infrared frequencies. The technique reveals novel features and predicts a strong red shift and intense absorption in the fundamental mode, which is responsible for the infrared anomaly observed in collections of fine metal particles.
