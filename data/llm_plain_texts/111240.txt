tldr: The author, Arthur Hill Hassall, discovered that indigo, a blue colorant, can be formed in human urine through a process of oxidation when exposed to air. This finding challenges previous theories about the presence of cyanurine in urine and raises questions about the relationship between indigo, hematin, and other animal colorants.
