tldr: During the Joint Air-Sea Interaction Experiment (JASIN 1978), researchers studied the water masses and mesoscale circulation in the North Rockall Trough. They found two main water masses in the upper layers: North Atlantic Water and Modified North Atlantic Water. The patterns of circulation remained relatively consistent between 200 meters and deeper depths. An anticyclonic eddy and a saline meander were observed, and the researchers used inverse analysis to investigate the reference level of the data sets. The study provided insights into the ocean circulation within the northeast Atlantic and the influence of deeper circulation on the thermohaline structure.
