tldr: This study examines the distribution of mast cells in various tissues of spotted mutant mice and the effects of different spotting genes on mast cell populations. The results show that the W locus controls mast cell populations in tissues, and the spotting gene mi has a dominant effect on mast cell distribution in the spleen. The absence of peptic ulceration in Harwell stocks with two W mutants suggests that the mutation alone may not have a direct genetic effect, and environmental factors could play a significant role.
