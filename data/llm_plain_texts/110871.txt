tldr: The author, George Fownes, investigates a volatile oil called furfurol, obtained from a mixture of bran, sulfuric acid, and water. Furfurol has a chemical formula of C15H6O6 and exhibits various properties, such as changing color when exposed to air or water. Fownes also studies furfuroamide, a substance derived from furfurol, with a formula of C5H6N03 and classifies it as an amide. Furfurol is found to be identical to the substance described by Dr. Stenhouse as artificial oil of ants.
