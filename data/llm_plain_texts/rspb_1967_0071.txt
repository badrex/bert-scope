tldr: This study investigates the distribution of aragonite in fossils, focusing on its presence in Tertiary and Mesozoic sediments. The authors found that aragonite is extensively preserved in Tertiary sediments and is common in Mesozoic rocks, particularly those with argillaceous lithology. No aragonite was found in fossils from Palaeozoic rocks. The authors suggest that the preservation of aragonite is due to the protective effect of the organic skeletal matrix, which requires reducing conditions for its preservation.
