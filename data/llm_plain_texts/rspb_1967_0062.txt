tldr: The author develops mathematical models and a computer simulation to study the evolution of dominance, over-dominance, and balanced polymorphism in genetic populations. They find that over-dominance evolves when the genetic variance in fitness is significant, leading to a stable polymorphism. This phenomenon can explain various genetic traits, such as the sickle cell trait in humans.
