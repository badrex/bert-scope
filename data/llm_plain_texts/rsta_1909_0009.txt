tldr: This article investigates the effect of pressure on the arc spectrum of copper, focusing on the wavelength range of 4000 to 4600 Å. The authors found that under increased pressure, the copper arc lines become broader and are displaced towards the red end of the spectrum. The intensity of the lines also changes with pressure, and some lines are completely obliterated at high pressures. The study provides insights into the behavior of the copper arc under pressure and contributes to the understanding of high-pressure physics.
