tldr: This article compares the packing of benzene in its crystal structure with its organization in cyclophane-benzene complexes. The study explores the similarities and differences in aromatic-aromatic interactions in both environments, suggesting that examining the structures of crystalline guests like benzene can provide guidance for rational host design.
