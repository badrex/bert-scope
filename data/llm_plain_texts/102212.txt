tldr: Mr. Flamstead developed a new method for calculating tide times at London Bridge by observing and correcting previous methods. He found that the greatest and least differences between the moon's true southing and high waters were not at the full or new and quarter moons, but closer to the neap tides. This new method allowed for more accurate predictions of tide times, which could be applied to other ports by adjusting the times accordingly.
