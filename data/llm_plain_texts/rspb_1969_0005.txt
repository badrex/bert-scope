tldr: The firefly eye, specifically the eye of Photuris, has a unique pseudocone structure with long corneal cones that contain laminated paraboloids. These paraboloids bend light rays towards the optical axis within the cone. A crystalline thread conducts light by internal reflexion to the receptors, which form two superimposed continuous sheets across the eye. The eye's structure and function provide insights into the formation of images in superposition compound eyes.
