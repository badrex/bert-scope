tldr: The authors studied the effects of alkaline cations, such as potassium, rubidium, cesium, and lithium, on cat spinal motoneurons. They found that lithium and cesium ions affect the spike potential and after-hyperpolarization, while rubidium ions have no significant impact. The researchers also investigated how these cations are removed from the cells and suggested that lithium ions are extruded by the sodium pump, while cesium ions are removed through the diffusion channels in the resting membrane.
