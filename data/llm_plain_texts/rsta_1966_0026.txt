tldr: The author investigates free hydromagnetic oscillations in the Earth's core using a simplified theoretical model. They find that these oscillations can explain the slow changes in the Earth's main geomagnetic field, known as the geomagnetic secular variation. The study also suggests that the westward drift of the geomagnetic field could be a result of these oscillations. The research provides insights into the complex processes occurring within the Earth's core and contributes to our understanding of Earth's magnetism.
