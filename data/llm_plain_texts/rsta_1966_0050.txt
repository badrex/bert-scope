tldr: This article discusses the correlation between different erosion tests, such as drop impact and vibratory cavitation erosion, to better understand the phenomenon of cavitation erosion in machinery. The authors investigate the effects of test conditions and variables, and provide a guide for selecting materials based on their erosion resistance. The study aims to help engineers reduce the negative effects of cavitation erosion in hydraulic machinery and steam turbines.
