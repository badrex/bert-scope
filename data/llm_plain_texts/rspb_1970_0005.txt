tldr: This study investigates the innervation and structural features of the cat spleen using various histological and electron microscopy techniques. The main splenic artery has both cholinergic and noradrenergic nerve supplies, but only noradrenergic fibers are found within the spleen. The sparse innervation of the smooth muscle is examined, and the presence of large and small granular vesicles in terminal fibers is observed. The findings suggest that the innervation pattern may determine the characteristics of neurotransmission in the spleen.
