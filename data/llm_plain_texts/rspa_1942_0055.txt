tldr: The author presents a new derivation of the tidal equations, addressing a previously discussed difficulty in their derivation. The derivation considers the symmetrized level surfaces and the ellipticity of the Earth, providing a clearer understanding of the equations' terms and their applicability to both deep and shallow layers. The author also explains the role of non-periodic gravitational potential in tidal problems and discusses the advantages of the new derivation.
