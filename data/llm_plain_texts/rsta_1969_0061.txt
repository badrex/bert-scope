tldr: The author examines the volcanic history and geology of Mount Suswa, a low-lying Quaternary volcano in Kenya's Eastern Rift Valley. The volcano consists of sodalite-bearing phonolitic lava flows and pyroclastic rocks. The author divides the volcanic history into three major eruptive episodes and discusses the formation of a unique collapse feature, a ring graben, within the older caldera. The study questions the widely held assumption of the 'Krakatau' mechanism for caldera formation and suggests that pressure releases along ring faults during cauldron collapse may be a more likely process.
