tldr: In this article, Robert Boyle presents a series of experiments demonstrating the effects of atmospheric pressure and vacuum on various phenomena, such as the weight of the air, the height of mercury in a barometer, and the behavior of gases in sealed containers. These experiments provide valuable insights into the properties of gases and contribute to the development of the scientific understanding of the nature of air and vacuum.
