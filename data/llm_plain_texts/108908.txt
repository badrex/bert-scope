tldr: The author discusses the conditions and equations that determine curves, specifically lines and conics, that satisfy given conditions and pass through certain points. The author also explores the concept of contact-loci, which are curves that represent the intersection points of a curve with another curve or curves. These contact-loci help determine the properties and characteristics of the curves in question.
