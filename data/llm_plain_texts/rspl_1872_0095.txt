tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the accuracy of using the spectroscope for analyzing the composition of certain alloys. They found that the spectroscope could detect minute differences in the composition of alloys and could potentially replace the traditional parting assay method for determining the value of gold bullion, saving time and effort.
