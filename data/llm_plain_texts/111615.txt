tldr: The author conducted experiments on various animals to study the factors influencing cutaneous absorption, particularly focusing on the absorption of atropine. They discovered that factors such as age, the use of chloroform as a solvent, and the presence of innervation can significantly affect the absorption rate. The author also found that the albino rat is a suitable animal model for studying cutaneous absorption due to its ease of measurement and low susceptibility to errors.
