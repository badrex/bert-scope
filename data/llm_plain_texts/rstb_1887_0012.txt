tldr: The author examines the organization and structure of fossil plants from the coal-measure deposits, specifically Heterangium tiliaceoides and Kaloxylon hookeri. They describe the plant's medullary axis, exogenous zone, phloem zone, and cortex, providing detailed observations and illustrations of their findings. This research contributes to the understanding of plant life during the Carboniferous period.
