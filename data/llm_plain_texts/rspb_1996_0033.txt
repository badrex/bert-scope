tldr: The authors discovered a significant number of long microsatellites in simple organisms such as slime molds, fungi, protists, prokaryotes, viruses, organelles, and plasmids. These microsatellites are characterized by trinucleotide repeats and show a bias towards A+T-rich motifs. They also found that these microsatellites displayed length polymorphisms when comparing independent clones. This discovery suggests that simple organism microsatellites may provide a valuable source of molecular markers for tracking disease outbreaks and the evolution of microorganisms.
