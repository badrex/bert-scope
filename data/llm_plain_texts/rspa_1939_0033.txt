tldr: The author presents a new method to find lower bounds for the number of integers that can be represented as sums of positive integral powers. This method improves upon the classical approach by Hardy and Littlewood and provides more precise inequalities. The author applies the method to cubes and fourth powers, which have important applications in Waring's Problem.
