tldr: The authors used pulse radiolysis and absorption spectroscopy to study the formation and reactions of transient species in irradiated water and oxygenated aqueous solutions. They discovered new absorption bands and provided a provisional identification of the absorbing species, including the carbonate radical ion and hydroperoxy radical. The study contributes to understanding the radiation chemistry of water and its interactions with oxygen.
