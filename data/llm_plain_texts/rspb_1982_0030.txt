tldr: This study investigates the termination of seasonal breeding in Japanese quail through photorefractoriness. Researchers found that quail develop a refractoriness to daylengths in late summer, which helps regulate their reproductive cycle. The birds can regain photosensitivity by exposure to shorter daylengths in autumn and winter. The physiological basis of this pattern of refractoriness remains a mystery, but it plays a crucial role in reproductive fitness and preventing offspring production in unfavorable conditions.
