tldr: The authors studied the morphology and topography of on- and off-alpha cells in the cat retina using neurofibrillar staining methods. They found that both on- and off-alpha cells occur in equal numbers and form a regular lattice. The dendritic trees of neighboring alpha cells overlap, and each retinal point is covered by the dendritic field of at least one on- and one off-alpha cell. The density of alpha cells peaks in the central area and decreases towards the retinal periphery.
