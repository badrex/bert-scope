tldr: The authors discuss the genetical aspects of size allometry in Drosophila melanogaster, focusing on the inheritance of body size and proportions. They describe how genetic and environmental factors affect size and proportions, and how selection can lead to changes in these characteristics. The authors also highlight the importance of understanding the complexity of allometric studies and the need for further experimental work to test hypotheses about genetic and environmental variations.
