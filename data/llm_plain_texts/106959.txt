tldr: The author, Abram Robertson, presents a new demonstration of the binomial theorem using the principles of multiplication. This approach simplifies the understanding of the theorem and its applications, such as extracting roots and raising powers to fractional exponents. The demonstration also provides insights into the structure of coefficients in polynomial equations.
