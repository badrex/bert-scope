tldr: The authors conducted experiments to separate and identify different proteins found in muscle tissue. They discovered four main proteins: myosin, myogen, globulin X, and myoalbumin. Myosin and myogen are native proteins, while globulin X and myoalbumin are denatured forms of proteins. The study helps in understanding the physiology of muscular contraction and provides a method for preparing cleanly separated fractions for further chemical and physico-chemical studies.
