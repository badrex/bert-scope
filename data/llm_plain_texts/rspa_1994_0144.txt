tldr: The authors introduce two new techniques based on the wavelet transform to analyze the self-similar structure of turbulence. The first method redefines the concept of 'eddy' using the Mexican Hat wavelet transform, allowing for a space-scale characterization of turbulence. The second method proposes a test for discriminating between local and global self-similarity based on successive averages of wavelet transforms. These techniques are applied to a high Reynolds number turbulence velocity signal, revealing insights into the nature of self-similarity at different scales of turbulence.
