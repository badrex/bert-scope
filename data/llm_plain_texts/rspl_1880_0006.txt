tldr: The author investigates the absorption spectra of cobalt salts and their reactions with various solvents and compounds. They discover that the spectrum of cobalt chloride changes depending on the solvent and concentration, and discuss the implications of these findings for the identification of cobalt compounds. The author also examines the spectra of other cobalt salts and their reactions with alkalies, and discusses the formation and properties of cobalt oxide.
