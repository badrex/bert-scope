tldr: In a 1938 discussion, researchers explored new aspects of plant virus diseases, focusing on the nature of the virus particle and its impact on biological research. They discussed the isolation and purification of virus particles, particle size, serological reactions, and the relationship between virus strains and host plants. The researchers also examined the behavior of virus strains when mixed with other viruses and tested on different host plants, providing insights into the complex interactions between viruses and their hosts.
