revised_title: 'A Study on Work-Hardening, Fatigue, and Non-Propagating Cracks in Metals'

tldr: This article discusses the behavior of fatigue cracks in metals, particularly focusing on non-propagating cracks. The authors explain that metals with good resistance to notch fatigue can develop a condition through strain-ageing that increases their resistance to crack propagation. They also emphasize the importance of understanding the factors governing crack growth and the role of non-propagating cracks in accounting for the difference between theoretical and experimental fatigue stress-concentration values.
