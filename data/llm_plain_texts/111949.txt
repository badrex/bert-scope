tldr: This article discusses the geological analysis of the lignites and clays found in Bovey Tracey, Devonshire. The author, William Pengelly, describes the history of the deposit and its excavation, as well as the various theories proposed by other scientists. The author also presents the findings of fossils in the deposit, which were identified as belonging to the Miocene age. The deposit is believed to have formed in a freshwater lake, and the author suggests that the waters of this lake were separated from the ocean by a barrier.
