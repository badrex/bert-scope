tldr: The article investigates the effect of high-frequency modulation on the stability of Poiseuille flow. It shows that modulation destabilizes the flow and alters the critical Reynolds number, even for large modulation amplitudes. The study provides insights into the behavior of flows with time-periodic instabilities and has implications for understanding turbulence in pulsatile blood flow.
