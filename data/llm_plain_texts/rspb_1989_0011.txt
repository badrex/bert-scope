tldr: The authors present a method to analyze post-perturbation gating kinetics of single ion channels, providing information about the underlying gating mechanism. They demonstrate the method using simulated data and apply it to a delayed-rectifier type channel, revealing a branched gating mechanism. This study helps in understanding the complex behavior of ion channels and their role in various biological processes.
