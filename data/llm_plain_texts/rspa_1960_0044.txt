tldr: This article discusses the impact of the environment on the energy levels and spectra of molecules in liquids and crystals. It explores various techniques to study these effects and explains how the environment influences electronic, vibrational, rotational, and nuclear energy levels. The article also highlights the differences between the energy levels of isolated molecules and those in condensed phases, and how the environment affects the intensities of absorption bands and the lifetime of excited states.
