tldr: The study measures the influx rates of fifteen amino acids in living rats, finding that all essential amino acids and other amino acids the brain cannot synthesize have high influx rates. The results suggest that amino acids enter the brain mainly through carrier-mediated transport processes with a high degree of specificity. The influx rates of amino acids were directly proportional to their concentrations in blood plasma.
