tldr: This study investigates the erosion properties of polyethylene (PE) when subjected to solid particle impact, focusing on the effects of angle, velocity, and mass flux rate. The research reveals that most erosion occurs at an angle of 90 degrees, and the dimensionless erosion parameter is computed using the rate of mass loss when steady-state erosion is established. The findings provide valuable insights into the susceptibility of PE material to erosion damage in various applications, such as gas distribution pipes, water supply systems, and industrial applications involving fluid transportation.
