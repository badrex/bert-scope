tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the effect of the Sun's surface and vacuum on the resistance of electrolytes. They found that a very high vacuum did not affect the sparks, and the resistance of an electrolyte is not influenced by the passage of a current. The author also expressed gratitude to their assistant, Mr. E. Everett, for their contributions to the experiments.
