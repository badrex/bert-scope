tldr: The author investigated the minimum potential difference required to produce sparks in various gases between large parallel plates at different pressures. The results showed that the striking potential decreased with decreasing pressure until a certain point, after which it rapidly increased. The study provided experimental evidence supporting the views on the behavior of the negative glow and positive column in gas discharges.
