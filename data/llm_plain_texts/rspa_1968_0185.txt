tldr: This article discusses the science and technology of aerosol pollution, specifically focusing on indoor air pollution. The author conducted experiments to measure the decay of various pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide and smoke, in a controlled environment. The results showed that indoor air pollution can be significantly affected by factors like air leakage, surface absorption, and human activities. The author also compared indoor and outdoor pollutant concentrations and found that indoor concentrations are generally lower but can be influenced by outdoor conditions.
