tldr: 'This article investigates the nature and periods of free oscillations in an ocean bounded by two meridians of longitude, focusing on the mode with a period near the semi-diurnal tide. The author finds that in an ocean of uniform depth, there is a normal mode of vibration with a period of 12 hours and 33 minutes of mean solar time. The study also reveals the positions of amphidromic points and the direction of rotation of nodal lines in the ocean.'
