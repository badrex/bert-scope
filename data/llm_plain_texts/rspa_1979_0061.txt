tldr: The article discusses the current state of knowledge about X-ray emitting clusters of galaxies, focusing on the structure and spectra of these sources. It presents recent results on the X-ray structure of clusters, including the Centaurus and Virgo clusters, and reports preliminary findings of a study of 30 cluster X-ray spectra. The detection of highly ionized iron emission lines in the spectra of several clusters is also discussed, and estimates of iron abundance are presented.
