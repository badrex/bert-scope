tldr: 'The author, William Crookes, conducted experiments to study the effects of heat on attraction and repulsion. He discovered that in a vacuum, heat seemed to increase the actions that oppose the force of gravity, leading him to investigate the connection between heat and gravity. The author reviewed previous research on the subject and discussed various experiments conducted by other physicists, including Libri, Fresnel, and Baden Powell.'
