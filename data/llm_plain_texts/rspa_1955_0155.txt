tldr: The authors present calculations on electron excitation of forbidden lines, specifically focusing on transitions with electric quadrupole moments. They discuss the distorted wave approximation and its application to complex atoms, as well as the connection between collision strengths and electric multipole moments. The study has implications for understanding atomic transitions in gaseous nebulae and other astrophysical applications.
