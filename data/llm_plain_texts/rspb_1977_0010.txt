tldr: The article discusses recent developments in medical endoscopy, focusing on tomosynthesis and coded aperture imaging as new approaches to three-dimensional imaging in diagnostic radiography. Tomosynthesis uses conventional tomographic equipment to record a set of radiographs from different positions, allowing for the synthesis of tomograms under visual control. Coded aperture imaging employs an array of simultaneously operated, point-like X-ray sources to record a coded X-ray image, enabling the generation of images of layers in deliberately chosen depth through post-processing. These techniques offer improved exposure time, radiation dose, and evaluation compared to traditional methods.
