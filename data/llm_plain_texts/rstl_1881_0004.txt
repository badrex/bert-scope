tldr: The authors investigate the induction of electric currents in infinite plates and spherical shells, expanding on Maxwell's theory. They analyze the effects of varying external magnetic systems on the plates and shells, and discuss the conditions required for electric potential to vanish. The study provides a deeper understanding of the behavior of electric currents and their applications in various conductive materials.
