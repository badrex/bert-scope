tldr: The authors conducted a series of measurements of the absorption spectra of bromine and iodine monochloride to determine if their molecules vibrate identically or similarly. They compared the spectra using Kirchhoff's 4-prism spectroscope and found that, although both spectra have many coincident lines, they are not identical overall.
