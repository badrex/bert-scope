tldr: This study investigates the effects of selective predation by birds and parasitoid attack on the butterfly Danaus chrysippus. The researchers found that toxic larvae are less likely to be predated by birds, making it advantageous for larvae to feed on non-toxic plants. However, bird predation at the adult stage counteracts this advantage. The polymorphism for palatability is maintained primarily through selection at the larval stage and not by bird predation on the adult butterflies.
