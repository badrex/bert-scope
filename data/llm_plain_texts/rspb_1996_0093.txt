revised_title: 'The Impact of Reproduction on Flight Performance in Gravid Starlings'
semantic_tags:
  - Avian reproduction
  - Flight performance
  - Predation risk
  - Reproductive costs
  - Starling behavior
tldr: 'This study found that female European starlings experience a decrease in escape performance, specifically in speed and angle of ascent during take-off, before and during egg-laying. The increased body mass associated with reproduction negatively affects flight performance, making it more difficult for the birds to escape predators. This reduced ability to escape predators is an important and previously overlooked cost of reproduction in birds.'
