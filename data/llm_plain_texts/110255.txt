tldr: The author proposes a plan to supply filtered water to the metropolis and its suburbs by constructing a filtering chamber below the bed of the River Thames. The filtered water would be conducted into a well and distributed to the houses using existing mains and branches. The filtering chamber would be built using brickwork, cement, and granite blocks, with a depth of eight feet and four feet below low-water mark.
