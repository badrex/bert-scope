tldr: The authors investigated the biosynthesis of porphyrins, focusing on the cyclotetramerization of porphobilinogen to form uroporphyrinogen III. They synthesized and studied various precursors and derivatives, including norporphobilinogen, A-methylnorphobilinogen, and linear porphobilinogen oligomers. Their findings provide insights into the mechanisms and potential applications of porphyrin synthesis.
