tldr: The authors study three cases of steady two-dimensional percolation of water through ground, providing exact mathematical solutions for each case. They consider groundwater motion in a broad embankment with vertical faces, taking into account evaporation from the free surface or water table; in the soil outside an irrigation dyke of rectangular section; and in the soil outside a number of parallel draining tubes. The study helps in understanding the characteristics of ground-water motion and the behavior of free surfaces, seepage surfaces, and boundaries in these scenarios.
