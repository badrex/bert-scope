tldr: The author, Robert Porrett, conducted experiments to analyze the constitution of prussic, ferruretted chyazic, and sulphuretted chyazic acids and their salts. He used the atomic theory to examine the proportions of elements in these compounds and their interactions with other substances. The study provides insights into the composition and decomposition of these acids and their salts, which can be useful for understanding chemical reactions and the properties of these substances.
