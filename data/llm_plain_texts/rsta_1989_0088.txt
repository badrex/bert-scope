tldr: The Mam Tor landslide in North Derbyshire is a massive example of a slump-earthflow, involving the movement of 1000 meters of mudstone. The landslide has a complex structure, with four distinct sectors, and has been active for thousands of years. The landslide's mechanics and movements are analyzed, with a focus on the role of winter rainstorms and the interaction between the landslide and the surrounding geology. The study provides valuable insights into the processes and factors involved in large landslides in similar geological settings.
