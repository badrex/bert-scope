tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the slow combustion of acetylene and oxygen mixtures. They found that the reaction rate was proportional to the square of the acetylene concentration and that the products included oxides of carbon, steam, glyoxal, formaldehyde, and formic acid. The pressure-time curves showed a progressive pressure fall with a marked abrupt change in the rate of fall, which occurred when all the original oxygen had disappeared. The results provided a deeper understanding of the slow combustion process and the formation of various oxidation products.
