tldr: 'This article presents an abstract of Nicolas Fatio De Duillier's discourse on the cause of gravity, which he read before the Royal Society in 1689/90. The text discusses Fatio De Duillier's ideas on gravity, which were seen by the author on March 19, 1689/90, at Gresham College. The author prefers the oldest version of the text, as it is closer to Fatio De Duillier's communication to the Royal Society.'
