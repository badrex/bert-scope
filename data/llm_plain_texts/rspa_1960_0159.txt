tldr: The authors studied the gaseous oxidation of aliphatic alcohols, specifically n-propyl and isopropyl alcohols, to understand their reaction mechanisms. They found that a chain mechanism is involved in the oxidation process, with hydrogen abstraction from the alcohol by H02 radicals and subsequent interaction with oxygen. The formation of aldehydes and other products is responsible for chain branching and the overall reaction. The authors also compared the reactivity of ethanol, n-propanol, and 2-propanol towards oxygen, finding that 2-propanol is less readily oxidized than the other two alcohols.
