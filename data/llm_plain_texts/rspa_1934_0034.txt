tldr: The authors conducted experiments on electron emission from a sodium-potassium alloy under the influence of various gases, focusing on carbonyl chloride. They found that the energy distribution of emitted electrons does not follow the Maxwell distribution, and they proposed a hypothesis to explain this observation, involving the formation of a polar chemical bond and the role of free electrons in the process.
