tldr: The authors Dirac and Bohr develop a new quantum theory for the interaction of atoms and electromagnetic waves. They show that this theory correctly explains the emission and absorption of radiation, and they demonstrate a harmony between the light-quantum and wave descriptions of the interaction. The mathematical development of the theory is based on the authors' general transformation theory of quantum mechanics.
