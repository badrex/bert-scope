tldr: The authors discovered that the microvillar tips of photoreceptors in tipulid flies undergo a transformation during membrane turnover. This transformation is caused by the local deletion of a microvillar cytoskeleton, which consists of a single axial filament linked to the plasma membrane by side-arms. The cytoskeleton's removal leads to deformation of the microvilli, and its intimate association with a Ca2+-activated thiol protease has implications for understanding membrane turnover and light-induced damage to arthropod photoreceptor membranes.
