tldr: This article discusses the element correlations and bulk composition of the Moon based on space missions and laboratory analyses. The authors estimate that the Moon's bulk composition contains about 60% refractory elements and 40% non-refractory elements, mainly (Mg, Fe)-silicates. The inhomogeneous accretion of the Moon is indicated, with a refractory core and more non-refractory material added until the Moon reached its final mass. The composition of the non-refractory portion of the Moon remained relatively constant during the accretion process.
