tldr: Humphry Davy conducted experiments to understand the magnetic phenomena produced by electricity and the properties of electrified bodies in relation to their conducting powers and temperature. He discovered that the conducting power of metallic bodies varied with temperature, and that the magnetic phenomenon was the same whether the electricity was small in quantity or passing through good conductors of considerable magnitude. He also found that the voltaic current in air was affected by the magnet, leading to new experiments and results in the field of electromagnetism.
