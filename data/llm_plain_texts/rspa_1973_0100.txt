tldr: The authors studied the gas-phase photolysis of acetaldehyde and found that the main decomposition occurs from the triplet state. They also discovered that the addition of butene-2 increases the yield of fluorescence and helps clarify the different roles of singlet and triplet states in the photochemistry of acetaldehyde.
