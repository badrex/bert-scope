tldr: This article discusses the kinetic accumulation of stress in bars, shafts, and axles due to repeated, impulsive, or changing torsional loading. The author presents a comprehensive mathematical solution to this problem, which also includes graphical representations and numerical calculations. The findings show that kinetic stress can significantly exceed the static stress in certain cases, highlighting the importance of considering kinetic accumulation in engineering designs.
