tldr: This article describes the case of Walter Walsh, an innkeeper who experienced a periodic evacuation of blood from the end of his forefinger. The condition started in 1658 and continued for 12 years, with blood loss varying from a small stream to a pottle at a time. Various treatments were attempted, but none were effective. Walsh eventually died from the condition in 1670.
