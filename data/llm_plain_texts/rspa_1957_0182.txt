tldr: The authors studied the generation of dislocations during the cleavage of crystals, particularly in rock salt and lithium fluoride. They discovered that a cleavage crack can create plastic deformation and dislocations when it is moving slowly or can be brought to a stop. This deformation occurs in narrow zones around the positions where the crack stops, and the crack runs freely elsewhere, resulting in perfect cleavage. The interference technique was used to detect and estimate the magnitude of this deformation, providing evidence that a cleavage crack can nucleate dislocations if it can be arrested for a time sufficient to allow deformation to develop.
