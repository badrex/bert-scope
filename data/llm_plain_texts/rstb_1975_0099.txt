tldr: This study investigates the intrinsic connections of the visual cortex area 17 in the monkey brain using light and electron microscopy. The research focuses on the origin and distribution of short fiber connections between cortical layers and the termination of other cortical connections from the opposite hemisphere and adjoining areas. The findings provide insights into the anatomical organization of the neocortex and its functional implications.
