tldr: The author, X. Aubert, supports Professor K. H. Meyer's view on muscle protein state and thermoelasticity. Observations on muscle in iodoacetate contracture show that the state of muscle proteins is similar to active contraction, and thermoelastic measurements provide insights into muscle elasticity and tension. The author also discusses the possibility of molecular reorganization during muscle stretch without damaging the muscle fiber.
