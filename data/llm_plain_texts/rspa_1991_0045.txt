tldr: This article presents a mixed finite element method for analyzing the dynamic interaction between fluids and elastic structures. The method uses a variational principle with acceleration in the solid and pressure in the fluid as arguments. Four different approaches are discussed, each producing symmetric matrix equations for easier application to various engineering problems. Examples of fluid-structure interaction problems are provided to demonstrate the method's effectiveness.
