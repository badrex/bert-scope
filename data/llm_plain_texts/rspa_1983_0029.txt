tldr: The authors studied the crystal and molecular structures of tris(ethylene)platinum and bis(ethylene)(tetrafluoroethylene)platinum using X-ray and neutron diffraction experiments. They found that the six ligated carbon atoms are coplanar with the Pt atom, and the coordination geometry is influenced by the nature of the substituent at the contact carbon atom. The results provide accurate molecular parameters for these important complexes.
