tldr: The author, Capt. Newland, observed milky white spots in the sea during his voyage and discovered that these spots were filled with a large number of small living organisms, or animalcules. This explained the unusual appearance of the water at night. The presence of these animalcules also allowed the water to appear bright even in the dark. The author also reported observing a comet during the journey.
