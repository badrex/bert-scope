tldr: The authors investigate the evolution of nuclear DNA in humans and primates using new methods in nucleic acid technology. They analyze gene arrangement and DNA sequence divergence within and between species, revealing evolutionary constraints and providing a powerful method for determining interspecific phylogenetic distances and analyzing human population structures. The study focuses on the evolution of haemoglobin genes and neighboring sequences, offering insights into the history of genetic changes during primate evolution.
