tldr: Researchers discovered decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine in the tapetum lucidum of catfish, a light-reflecting layer in their eyes. They found that this compound, along with tapetal pigment and thiamine, made up 44%, 17%, and 2% of the dry mass of the reflecting material, respectively. This study helps to understand the chemistry of the tapetum lucidum and its role in fish vision.
