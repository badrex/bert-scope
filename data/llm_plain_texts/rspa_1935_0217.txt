tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the energy of disintegration of radio-phosphorus [P30] and its implications. They found that the energy of the upper limit of the positrons from radio-phosphorus is close to 2.9 x 10^6 volts, corresponding to the formation of the product nucleus Si30 in its ground state. This discovery helps in understanding the forces of cohesion between nuclear particles and the energy changes in atomic disintegrations.
