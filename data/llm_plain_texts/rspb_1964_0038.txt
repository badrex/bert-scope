tldr: This study investigates the relationship between the chemical structure of pentacyclic triterpenes and their icterogenic activity. The research focuses on the effects of substituents on carbon atoms 17, 19, 20, and 22. The findings suggest that icterogenicity is associated with the 22/β-angeloyloxy side chain, and esterification of the C(28) carboxyl or replacement of the side chain with a simple saturated fatty acid results in a loss of activity. The study provides insights into the understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind the icterogenic activity of triterpenes.
