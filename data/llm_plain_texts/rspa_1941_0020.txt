tldr: This collection of abstracts presents research on various topics, including the measurement of horizontal pressure gradients in the sea, the efficiency of hydrogen atom reactions, and the study of luminescence phenomena in solids. The authors explore the decay laws of phosphorescence, photoconductivity, and the absorption spectra of ethylene and other alkyl-substituted ethylenes. These studies contribute to a better understanding of the physical properties and processes in these areas.
