tldr: 'The authors derive the thermodynamic properties, such as energy, pressure, free energies, and entropy, for a Fermi-Dirac ideal gas, taking into account the effects of relativistic mechanics. They provide series expansions for these properties in terms of a non-dimensional parameter. The study covers two limiting cases: the completely non-relativistic and the completely relativistic, with formulae and numerical values given in a table. The authors also discuss the implications of their findings for the understanding of thermodynamics in extreme conditions.'
