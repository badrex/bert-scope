tldr: This article discusses the evidence for chemical heterogeneity in the Earth's mantle, focusing on isotopic and chemical effects produced by a continuously differentiating and convecting Earth mantle. The authors analyze various data, including Sr and Nd ratios, to understand the chemical composition of the mantle and its implications for the formation of the Earth's crust. They also explore the role of mantle convection and the subduction of oceanic crust in generating chemical anomalies.
