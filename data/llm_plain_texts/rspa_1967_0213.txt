tldr: This article examines the vibration-rotation interaction and transition moments in OH molecules. The authors re-examine the density distribution in the ultraviolet bands of OH, leading to a vibrational transition moment. They also explore the interaction of rotation and electronic motion, which results in a rotational transition moment. The authors discuss the implications of these findings on the measurement of rotational temperature and the accuracy of transition probabilities.
