tldr: 'This study investigates the densities of protein crystals and the effects of different media on protein hydration. The authors found that the density of protein crystals can be altered by about 3% by changing the composition of the medium. They also discovered that it is crucial to specify the medium used in experiments, as it can affect the results. The findings contribute to a better understanding of protein structure and function.'
