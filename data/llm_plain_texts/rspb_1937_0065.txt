tldr: The authors studied the structure and components of the sheaths surrounding giant nerve fibers in squid. They identified three layers: endoneural tissue, a myelin-containing sheath called the metatropic sheath, and an internal protoplasmic layer. The metatropic sheath is similar to the myelin sheath found in vertebrate nerve fibers and plays a crucial role in the squid's nervous system.
