tldr: This article discusses the infrared opacity of Jupiter's upper atmosphere and how it is influenced by line blanketing from strong absorption bands of ammonia and organic molecules. The authors investigate the ion-molecule chemistry of the upper Jovian atmosphere and calculate equilibrium and non-equilibrium abundances of products. They specifically examine ethylene concentrations and their effect on infrared radiation during a satellite shadow passage.
