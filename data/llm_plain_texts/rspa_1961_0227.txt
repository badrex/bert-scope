tldr: This study investigates the sea-level cosmic ray spectra at large zenith angles to understand the production and propagation of mesons in the atmosphere. The authors used a nuclear emulsion spectrograph to analyze the trajectories of fast charged particles and found that the main assumptions concerning meson production and propagation in the atmosphere are correct. The results provide insights into the relative proportions of positive and negative mesons and help test models of meson propagation in the atmosphere.
