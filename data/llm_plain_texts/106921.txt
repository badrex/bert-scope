tldr: The author, Edward Pigott, observed and documented the periodical changes in brightness of two fixed stars, one in Sobieski's Shield and the other in the Northern Crown. The changes in brightness occurred over different periods, with the star in Sobieski's Shield completing its changes in about 63 days, while the star in the Northern Crown had a period of ten months and a half. These observations provided valuable information for future astronomers to study and understand the behavior of variable stars.
