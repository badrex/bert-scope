tldr: This article discusses the development and challenges of submillimetre astronomy, a branch of astronomy that studies radiation in the submillimetre wavelength range. The author highlights the importance of this field in solving various astronomical problems, such as investigating the characteristics of prestellar matter, the state and chemical composition of interstellar and intergalactic matter, the nature of infrared stars and quasars, planetary atmospheres, and solar radiation. The article also touches upon the instrumental techniques used in submillimetre astronomy, such as superheterodyne receivers and optical methods.
