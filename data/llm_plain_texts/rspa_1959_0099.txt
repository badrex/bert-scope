tldr: The author investigates the effects of thermal transformations on the ultra-violet absorption of ionic crystals, focusing on the role of ion pair formation and complex formation in the melting process. They study the absorption spectra of nitrates and thiocyanates, observing changes in absorption maxima and band edges as the crystals melt. The findings provide insights into the mechanisms of melting and the behavior of ionic crystals under thermal transformations.
