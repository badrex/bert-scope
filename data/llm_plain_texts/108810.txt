tldr: The author collected and analyzed temperature data from various stations in India and the Indian Archipelago between 1854 and 1858. They developed a method to calculate daily mean temperatures, taking into account the daily variation and the specific geographical and topographical characteristics of each station. The study provides valuable insights into the climate and temperature patterns of the region, which can be useful for understanding the effects of climate change and for selecting suitable locations for settlements and sanitariums.
