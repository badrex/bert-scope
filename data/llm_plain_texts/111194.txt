tldr: The author, Edward Schunck, investigates the decomposition of rubian, a substance found in madder, by alkalies and alkaline earths. He identifies five products of decomposition: alizarine, verantine, rubiretine, sugar, and rubiadine. Schunck also discovers a ferment, erythrozym, in madder that causes rubian decomposition. This study helps understand the formation of colorants in madder and the properties of erythrozym.
