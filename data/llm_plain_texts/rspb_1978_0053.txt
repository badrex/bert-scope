tldr: This study investigates the adverse effects of lipid peroxidation on human spermatozoa and the role of seminal plasma in preventing these effects. The research shows that spermatozoa from poor-quality semen undergo peroxidation faster than those from normal ejaculates, and that seminal plasma contains a factor that counteracts the toxic effects of both endogenous and exogenous lipid peroxidation. The findings suggest that lipid peroxidation could be used as a basis for a biochemical method of semen quality appraisal.
