tldr: The study investigates the production of extracellular nitrogenous substances by the nitrogen-fixing blue-green alga Anabaena cylindrica. The research shows that the amount of extracellular combined nitrogen is relatively higher in young cultures and decreases as the cultures age. The extracellular combined nitrogen consists mainly of polypeptides and amide, which are not specific products of free nitrogen fixation. The ecological effects of these extracellular products are discussed, suggesting their importance in freshwater ecosystems due to their capacity to form soluble complexes with various inorganic nutrients.
