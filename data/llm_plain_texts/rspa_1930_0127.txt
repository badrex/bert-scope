tldr: The authors develop the operational wave equation to explain the Zeeman effect, which occurs when an atom's energy levels change due to an external magnetic field. They analyze the charge and current density of atoms, determining the electric and magnetic moments, and use the wave equation to calculate the matrix elements required for the theory of the Zeeman effect. This work provides a new approach to understanding atomic physics and the behavior of atoms in magnetic fields.
