tldr: The author, John Davy, conducted numerous observations on human body temperature using a precise instrument. He found that the temperature fluctuates throughout the day, being highest in the morning and lowest at night. The temperature also changes with physical and mental exertion, and after eating. Davy suggests that understanding these fluctuations could help regulate clothing, warm apartments, and possibly prevent and treat diseases, improving overall comfort and health.
