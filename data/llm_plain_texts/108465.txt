tldr: 'Faraday discovered that when bismuth is placed in a magnetic field, it tends to align itself along the axial direction, a phenomenon he called the magnecrystalline effect. This finding expanded the understanding of diamagnetism and introduced a new force in the molecules of matter. Faraday's experiments showed that this effect occurs regardless of the strength or direction of the magnetic field, and it is distinct from both diamagnetic and ordinary magnetic actions.'
