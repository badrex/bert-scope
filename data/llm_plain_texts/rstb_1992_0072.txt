tldr: This study investigates how listeners perceive and reason about relations among musical instrument timbres using multidimensional scaling techniques. The research focuses on complex, synthetic tones and tests whether listeners can use the structure of a perceptual space to perform analogy tasks. Results support the parallelogram model, indicating that listeners can perceive abstract relations among timbres without specific training in such tasks.
