tldr: The author examines the anatomy and histology of insect flight muscles, focusing on their evolution and adaptation to different insect orders. They describe the changes in muscle structure and function as insects developed more advanced flying mechanisms, such as high-frequency wing vibration. The study also highlights the unique myogenesis process in insects and its implications for understanding striated muscle fibers.
