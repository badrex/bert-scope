tldr: The author conducted spectroscopic observations of Comet Coggia and discovered that the comet's light contained three bright bands similar to the spectrum of carbon compounds. The author also found a shift in the bands, indicating a relative motion between the comet and the Earth. The presence of hydrocarbons in comets is suggested, as they may contain carbon in combination with hydrogen.
