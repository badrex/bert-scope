tldr: The author examines cationic polymerizations induced by ionizing radiations and proposes a new theory to account for inconsistencies in the interpretations of the rates of cationic polymerizations. The author suggests that not all cations are propagators, and there may be more than one kind of non-propagating cation and more than one kind of propagator. This new understanding of the mechanisms of ionic reactions in organic media can help improve the understanding of polymerization processes.
