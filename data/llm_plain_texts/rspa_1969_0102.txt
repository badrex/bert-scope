tldr: The article discusses the technique of ion implantation using nuclear reactions (n.r.i.), which involves implanting radioactive isotopes into a host lattice to study their properties and interactions. The author focuses on two diagnostic techniques, the Mossbauer effect and perturbed angular correlation, which are used to analyze the hyperfine interactions between the implanted isotopes and their environment. The article also provides a roadmap of suitable nuclear states for n.r.i. studies and highlights the advantages and limitations of each diagnostic technique.
