tldr: This article applies the Bloch theory to study the properties of alloys and bismuth. It examines the lattice parameters of s- and -phases in binary alloys and the structure of bismuth. The author also discusses the internal stresses arising from electron distribution in space and the energy discontinuities in crystal structures.
