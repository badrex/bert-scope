  - High-Resolution Electron Microscopy
tldr: This article discusses four new methods for characterizing layered silicates and their intercalates: high-resolution solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, X-ray photoelectron studies, high-resolution electron microscopy, and neutron scattering studies. These techniques provide insights into the structure, properties, and behavior of clay minerals and their intercalates with organic guests, focusing on serpentines, kandites, smectites, micas, vermiculites, chloritoids, zeolites, and intergrowths of these minerals.
