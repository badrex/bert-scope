revised_title: Modelling Fatigue Crack Growth by Successive Blocking of Dislocations

  - Hardening
tldr: The authors propose a model for fatigue crack growth that considers the successive blocking of dislocations by slip barriers, such as grain boundaries. They explain the intermittent pattern of decelerating and accelerating crack growth and the transition from short to long crack regimes. The model incorporates the effects of microstructural barriers, crack tip plasticity, and hardening on crack growth rates.
