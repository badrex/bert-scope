tldr: The authors conducted experiments using polonium particles to bombard various elements, resulting in the artificial production of nuclear radiation. They discovered that the radiations from different elements have varying levels of penetrating power, with some having energies of millions of electron volts, higher than any known beta rays emitted from radioactive elements. The findings suggest that a new process may be taking place, forming a new nucleus by capturing the particle and releasing energy in the form of radiation.
