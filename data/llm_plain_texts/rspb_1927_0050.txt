tldr: 'The author, Hans Spemann, discusses the concept of organizers in animal development and the role of the centre of organization. He explains how organizers, such as the roof of the archenteron, can induce different cell types and organs in embryos. Spemann also describes experiments that demonstrate the extent and origin of the centre of organization in early gastrula stages.'
