tldr: 'In 1769, Reverend Mr. Ludlam observed the Transit of Venus and the Solar Eclipse from Leicester. He used a telescope made by Mr. Dollond and an Hadley's quadrant to record the event. The observations provided valuable data on the transit's duration and the solar eclipse, contributing to the understanding of our solar system.'
