tldr: The authors conducted a study on the excitation and ionization of helium atoms by electrons of moderate velocity. They used quantum mechanical methods to calculate the variation of excitation probability with the velocity of impact and found that Born's approximation is valid for electrons with energies greater than 200 volts. The study also explored the angular distributions of ejected and scattered electrons and compared the calculated results with experimental observations.
