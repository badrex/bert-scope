tldr: The author conducted experiments on the freezing of egg albumen and discovered that fresh eggs resist freezing longer than previously frozen or altered eggs. The author found that the albumen of fresh eggs freezes like water, unlike other substances, and suggested that this unique property may be due to a mechanical construction peculiarity. This research sheds light on the nature and purpose of egg albumen and its differences from other albuminous substances and organic tissues.
