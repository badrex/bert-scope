tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the chemical reactions of antimony pentachloride with water. They discovered that antimony pentachloride forms two different hydrates, a monohydrate and a tetrahydrate, when mixed with water. The authors also found that antimony oxychloride, previously thought to be formed by the reaction of water with antimony pentachloride, does not exist. This discovery helps to better understand the chemical properties and reactions of antimony compounds.
