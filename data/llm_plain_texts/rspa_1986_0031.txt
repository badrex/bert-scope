  - Particle Physics Experiments
  - Underground Detectors
  - Astrophysical Observations
tldr: This article discusses the results and potential uses of underground detectors in studying grand unified theories, particularly focusing on proton decay and astrophysical observations. The authors explain the concepts of grand unification, symmetry breaking, and the role of underground detectors in exploring these ideas. They also touch upon the challenges and future possibilities in this field.
