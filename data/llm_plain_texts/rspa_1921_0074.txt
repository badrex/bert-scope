tldr: The authors conducted experiments with sulfur suspensions and observed interesting optical effects, such as changes in the color of transmitted light. They explained these phenomena using the mathematical theory of light scattering by small particles and found that the suspension's ability to transmit light increases with the size of the particles. This study helps to understand the behavior of light in various suspensions and the role of particle size in the transmission of light.
