tldr: This study investigates the relationship between viscosity, elasticity, and plastic strength in a soft material like flour dough. The authors found that the dough's viscosity decreases as the shearing stress increases. They also discovered that the rate of shear under a given stress is not uniform and diminishes as the shearing proceeds. This research provides insights into the mechanical properties of dough and its behavior under different conditions.
