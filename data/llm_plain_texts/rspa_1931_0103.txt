tldr: The authors conducted a detailed spectroscopic analysis of the flame of carbon disulphide, focusing on the molecular spectra of sulfur and carbon compounds. They discovered that the characteristic bands in the flame are due to molecular sulfur (S2) and sulfur monoxide (SO). Additionally, they detected carbonyl sulfide (COS) in the flame, which could help determine its presence or absence in the CS2 flame.
