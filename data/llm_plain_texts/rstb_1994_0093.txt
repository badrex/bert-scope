tldr: This article explores the efficiency and evolution of water transport systems in early land plants using a modeling approach. The authors demonstrate that the necessity for efficient water transport systems constrained the evolution of land plants, similar to the problems of gravity and reproduction/fertilization. They analyze the water budget and water transport problems of the earliest land plants, focusing on the evolution of the protostele, a central water-conducting structure found in early vascular plants.
