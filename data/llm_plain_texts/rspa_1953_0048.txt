tldr: The authors study the movement of microscopic organisms, such as spermatozoa and nematodes, through viscous fluids. They find that these organisms primarily use viscous forces for propulsion, and their movement can be explained by the propagation of disturbances along thin flagella or tails. The authors develop a mathematical model using Stokeslet and doublet distributions to describe the velocity field and predict the velocity of propulsion for these organisms.
