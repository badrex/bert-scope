tldr: The author conducted a series of observations using a new instrument to investigate the parallax of fixed stars. The observations were focused on the meridional difference in polar distance of a Cygni and P Aurigae. The results suggested that the parallax of a Cygni was too small to have caused the discordances in previous observations.
