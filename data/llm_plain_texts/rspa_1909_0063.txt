tldr: The authors developed a sensitive micro-balance capable of measuring minute quantities with an accuracy of one-thousandth of a milligramme. They constructed two types of micro-balances: Type A, for measuring small alterations in weight, and Type B, for absolute weight determinations. The micro-balances were designed to detect and measure the changes in weight of radioactive substances, which was a significant advancement in the field of science at the time.
