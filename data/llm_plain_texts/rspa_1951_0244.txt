tldr: The authors propose a new approach to the electronic structure of molecules using perturbation theory, focusing on the interaction of atoms and ions in molecules. They argue that this method is more suitable for complex systems and can provide more accurate results than existing orbital theories. The approach involves using atomic orbitals to construct approximate atomic functions and estimate interaction terms, while the energies of unperturbed states are determined by more complex atomic functions or experimentally determined atomic term values.
