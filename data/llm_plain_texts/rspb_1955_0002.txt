tldr: This lecture discusses the importance of studying soil metabolism and the complex interactions between microorganisms in soil. The author highlights the vast population of microorganisms in soil and how they are dependent on each other and their environment. Soil is considered a complex biological system where organisms compete for limited resources and establish a dynamic equilibrium. The chemical aspects of soil microbiology play a crucial role in crop production and various chemical transformations in the soil. The author also describes a new method for studying soil metabolism, using a column of soil perfused with oxygenated fluid, to better understand the chemical and biological processes occurring in soil.
