revised_title: 'Comparing Sunspot Areas, Diurnal Temperature Ranges, and Diurnal Declination-Ranges'
semantic_tags:
  - Sunspots
  - Solar activity
  - Terrestrial magnetism
  - Climate
  - Periodic phenomena
tldr: This article compares the apparent inequalities of short periods in sunspot areas with diurnal declination-ranges at Toronto and Prague. The authors discuss the connections between these solar and terrestrial phenomena, analyzing their similarities and differences in terms of duration, phase, and constancy of type. While the study does not conclusively prove a connection between these phenomena, the observed similarities suggest that further research may reveal physical links between solar activity and terrestrial magnetism.
