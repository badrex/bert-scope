tldr: An observing gentleman reported a boisterous spring in Westphalia that flows twice in 24 hours. He also discussed salt springs in Germany and shared information on separating salt from saltwater without fire. The method involves using a wax vessel submerged in seawater, which results in sweet water and the spirit of salt remaining in the vessel.
