tldr: Emanuel Mendez Da Costa examines the origin and nature of belemnites, fossilized marine creatures with a unique structure. He discusses various theories about their origin and refutes the idea that they are teeth or horns of fish, shells, or spines of echini. Da Costa argues that belemnites are a distinct type of marine fossil and that all belemnites share the same origin.
