tldr: This article discusses the importance of uranium-series dating in understanding the origin of modern humans. It explains the method of uranium-series dating, which is based on measuring the radioactivity of short-lived daughter isotopes of uranium in samples that initially contained only the parent uranium. The article highlights the advantages of uranium-series dating, such as its ability to provide high-precision dates on materials found at various hominid sites and not relying on knowledge of environmental conditions at a site. The author also discusses the different datable materials, such as stalagmites, travertines, bones, teeth, and shells, and the challenges in using them for dating.
