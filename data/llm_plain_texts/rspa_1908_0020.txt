tldr: The author presents a new method for determining the vapor density of gases and vapors using charcoal and low temperatures. The method involves cooling a substance to low temperatures, absorbing it in a charcoal-filled bulb, and then weighing the bulb. The author tests the method on carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide, finding that it provides accurate results within the desired limits of accuracy.
