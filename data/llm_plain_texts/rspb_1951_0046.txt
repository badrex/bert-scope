  - Direct adaptation hypothesis
tldr: The author investigates the mechanism of bacterial adaptation to D-arabinose in Bact. lactis aerogenes. They find that the bacteria develop an alternative metabolic route through direct adaptation, rather than through mutation and selection. This discovery challenges the mutation theory and supports the direct adaptation hypothesis.
