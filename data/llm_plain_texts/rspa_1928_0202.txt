tldr: The authors studied the crystal structure of topaz, a mineral composed of aluminum, fluorine, and silicon dioxide. They discovered that the structure does not fit into the commonly recognized cubic or hexagonal close-packed arrangements. Instead, it has a unique arrangement of oxygen and fluorine atoms, which is discussed in detail. The study used X-ray spectroscopy and provided insights into the unit cell dimensions and space group of the topaz crystal.
