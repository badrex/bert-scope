tldr: The authors studied the adaptation and composition changes in Rhodopseudomonas spheroides when grown under different conditions. They found that anaerobically grown cells have a different composition than cells grown under oxygen, with a major increase in protein and phospholipid content. The authors also observed that during adaptation to semi-anaerobic conditions, there is a significant increase in particulate protein, phospholipid, and enzymes related to bacteriochlorophyll synthesis before the formation of photopigments or chromatophores.
