tldr: The author, Baden Powell, examines the phenomena of prismatic dispersion and the relationship between the index of refraction and the length of a wave for each definite ray throughout various media. Using a formula derived from M. Cauchy's theory of undulations, Powell finds that the refractive indices for each of the seven definite rays in different substances are closely related to the lengths of their waves, providing a representation of the law of nature and supporting the wave theory of light.
