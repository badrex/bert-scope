tldr: 'This study investigates the lung function and exercise responses of Trinidadian males from different ethnic backgrounds. The results show that African and East Indian Trinidadian males have lower lung volumes and ventilatory capacities compared to European Trinidadian males. However, these differences disappear when considering body muscle. The study concludes that while ethnic factors contribute to ventilatory capacity and tidal volume, they are not significant determinants of maximal oxygen uptake compared to factors like habitual activity, environmental temperature, and body muscle.'
