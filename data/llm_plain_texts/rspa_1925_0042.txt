tldr: The authors analyze the Fulcher hydrogen bands and propose a new classification and interpretation of the bands. They suggest that the extra lines in the triplets can be considered as extending the triplets into quadruplets, and the triplet series resemble one another closely, except for a difference in scale. The authors also examine the possibility of attributing the close together lines to successive vibrational states of the nuclei within the molecule.
