tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the di-iodide of mercury to study its behavior under heat. They found that the substance has distinct molecular anomalies and can exist in two crystalline forms. The di-iodide of mercury expands differently when heated, and the authors determined its coefficient of cubical expansion. This research contributes to understanding the properties of mercury compounds and their applications.
