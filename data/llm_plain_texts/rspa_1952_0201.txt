tldr: This article explores the wave functions and energy matrices for nuclear configurations, focusing on the seniority number and reduced isotopic spin as key quantum numbers. The authors demonstrate that these quantum numbers are useful for understanding energy levels and ordering of nuclear states, especially for short-range forces. The study also provides energy-level diagrams for various configurations and interactions, highlighting the persistence of the ordering of levels according to symplectic quantum numbers even for practical ranges.
