tldr: This article discusses the relationship between major crustal shear zones and the geological processes of metamorphism and magmatism in the continental lithosphere. It explores the role of shear heating in generating metamorphic anomalies within and around deep-seated fault zones, and how this process may vary between crustal and lithospheric shear zones. The author also highlights the need for further research on the subject.
