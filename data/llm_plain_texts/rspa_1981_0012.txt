tldr: The authors studied the martensitic transformation in f.c.c. manganese alloys using ultrasonics and neutron scattering. They found that as the manganese content increases, severe elastic anomalies develop in these materials, leading to a cubic-to-tetragonal martensitic transformation. The study also revealed unusual inter-atomic forces and phonon softening in the alloys, which are a consequence of an enhanced electron-phonon interaction. The findings provide insights into the properties of these materials and their potential applications.
