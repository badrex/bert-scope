tldr: This article presents a unified theory of recombination-generation noise in semiconductors, covering various mechanisms such as direct band-band transitions, Shockley-Read recombination via traps, and certain Auger effects. The theory is based on irreversible thermodynamics and provides expressions for transient and steady-state lifetimes, as well as a general approach to evaluate equilibrium transition rates and particle numbers.
