tldr: The study investigates the morphology of dorsal unpaired median (DUM) neurons in the suboesophageal ganglion (SOG) of the migratory locust. It reveals that these neurons innervate the principal neuropiles of the locust brain, including the antennal lobes, pedunculi, calyces of the mushroom body, and the central complex. The research also compares the number and location of DUM cell bodies stained with intracellular fills to those obtained with backfilling cervical or circumoesophageal connectives or octopamine-immunocytochemistry.
