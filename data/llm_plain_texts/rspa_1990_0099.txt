tldr: The author derived a determinantal expression for the Teukolsky-Starobinsky constant for arbitrary integral and half-odd integral spins in the context of black holes and gravitational waves. The research provides a simpler way to evaluate the constant and has implications for understanding the behavior of particles and fields with spins greater than two in curved space-times.
