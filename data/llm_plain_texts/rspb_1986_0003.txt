tldr: The study investigates the cytological changes in the sponge Callyspongia diffusa during allograft rejection, autograft fusion, and inflammatory responses. It observes the migration of mesohyl cells towards rejection zones and areas of tissue damage. The results show no differences in mesohyl cell composition between alio- and autograft zones and injury areas. However, archaeocytes form 'fronts' at allograft interfaces, suggesting a specific cellular interaction during responses to allogeneic contact.
