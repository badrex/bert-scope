tldr: The author presents a study on the effects of carbon dioxide on respiration volumes. They found that the volumes of air emitted after rebreathing air containing carbon dioxide are slightly higher than the volumes of air emitted during ordinary breathing. This suggests that the body responds to increased carbon dioxide levels by increasing the amount of air exchanged in the lungs.
