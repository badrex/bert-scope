tldr: The author conducted experiments on rabbit eggs to study their development and fertilization. They discovered that unfertilized eggs can undergo varying degrees of development, similar to fertilized eggs. The author also observed that rabbit eggs enter the uterus and undergo rapid disintegration between 72 and 96 hours after copulation. Some unfertilized eggs showed evidence of development in vivo, with the formation of polar bodies and small cells.
