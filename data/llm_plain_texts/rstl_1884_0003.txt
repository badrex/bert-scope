tldr: 'This article discusses the experiments conducted to investigate the solubility of salts in water at high temperatures. The authors found that the solubility of sodium sulfate increases with temperature, and they also explored the effects of pressure and the relation between solubility and fusibility. They developed a new apparatus to conduct these experiments, which allowed them to study the solubility of various salts at different temperatures.'
