tldr: This study investigates the formation and behavior of supersonic vortex rings with embedded rearward-facing shocks in a shock tube. The authors use differential interferometry to visualize the flow development and describe the process in detail. They also perform simplified quasi-steady calculations and compare them with previously measured pressures in the flow field, finding agreement with the physical description of the flow. The results provide insights into the complex interactions between vortex rings and shock waves in supersonic flows.
