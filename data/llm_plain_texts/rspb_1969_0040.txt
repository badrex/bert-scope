  - Lysosomal Function
tldr: The authors discuss the uptake of biologically active substances, such as dyes, drugs, and carcinogens, by lysosomes. They use fluorescence microscopy and other techniques to study the process and its implications for understanding lysosomal function and cellular processes. The findings suggest that lysosomes play a crucial role in the breakdown of complex molecules and can concentrate various substances, which may have implications for disease and cellular health.
