tldr: In 1749, Dr. Jo. Martyn reported an earthquake that shook London and its surroundings. The earthquake was felt at 40 minutes past noon and was most intense near the River Thames. While some neighbors believed it was caused by the explosion of the Powder Mills at Hounslow, Martyn concluded it was an earthquake after receiving reports from various locations. The earthquake was felt as far east as Calais and Boulogne, but not beyond two miles west of London.
