tldr: This study investigates the influence of eddy entrainment and combustion in depth processes on the turbulent kinetic energy balance in a flame. The research examines the effects of approach turbulence intensity, scale, and laminar burning velocity on each term and the energy balance as a whole. The results highlight the importance of small-scale turbulent motion and the role of viscous dissipation in the energy balance. The study also shows that an increase in laminar burning velocity reduces or eliminates eddy entrainment, affecting the convection term in the energy balance.
