tldr: The author examines the peripheral distribution of the fibres of the posterior roots of spinal nerves in various animals. They study the skin-fields of different nerve roots and their relation to the underlying deep tissues. The author also investigates the reflex arc and the effects of spinal reactions on the size and features of the areas of the root-fields. This research contributes to the understanding of the nervous system and its functions.
