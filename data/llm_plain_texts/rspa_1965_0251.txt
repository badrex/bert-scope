tldr: The authors present a theory for calculating relativistic hyperfine structure in many-electron atoms. They develop an effective Hamiltonian that accounts for relativistic effects and can be used in non-relativistic coupling calculations. This approach simplifies the computational process and allows for more accurate predictions of hyperfine structure in atoms.
