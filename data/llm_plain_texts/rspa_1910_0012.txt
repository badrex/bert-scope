tldr: This article presents an experiment conducted to study the recombination of ions at different temperatures. The authors used a layer of air ionized by a single flash from a RÃ¶ntgen bulb and measured the number of ions received by the electrodes under varying temperatures and fields. The results showed that the recombination of ions decreased somewhat rapidly with a rise in temperature but less rapidly as the temperature increased further. The study also confirmed that diffusion was negligible in the experiment.
