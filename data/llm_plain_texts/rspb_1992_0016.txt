tldr: The authors studied the voltage-dependent block of the cyclic GMP-activated conductance in salamander rod outer segments by L-cis-diltiazem. They found that the block increased with membrane depolarization and that the kinetics of block were accelerated by increasing L-cis-diltiazem concentration and depolarization. The results suggest that L-cis-diltiazem interacts with a binding site located about halfway across the membrane field and is unable to fully traverse the cyclic GMP-activated channel.
