tldr: 'Henry Cavendish conducted experiments to understand the properties of air and the effects of the electric spark on it. He discovered that when air is exposed to an electric spark, it is converted into nitrous acid, rather than fixed air as previously thought. This finding challenged the prevailing phlogiston theory and contributed to the understanding of gas laws and acid-base chemistry.'
