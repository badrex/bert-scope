tldr: 'Ceramide, an endogenous lipid molecule, plays a crucial role in mediating biological responses, including apoptosis and growth inhibition. It regulates protein phosphorylation by stimulating a serine/threonine protein phosphatase and a proline-directed kinase. Ceramide is generated in response to cellular stimulation by hormones and cytokines, making it an essential component of cell signaling pathways.'
