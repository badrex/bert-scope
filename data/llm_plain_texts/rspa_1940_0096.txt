tldr: This study investigates the X-ray structure and elastic strains in copper while the metal is under tensile stress. The research shows that the permanent strain is associated with the breakdown of grains into crystallite formations, which is an irreversible process. The elastic strain of the metal is accompanied by reversible changes in the atomic lattice without any permanent distortion. The study also reveals the differences in the rate of strain in neighboring grains subjected to the same external stress, which explains the extensive breakdown of grains into components of varying orientations in polycrystalline metals after deformation beyond the yield point.
