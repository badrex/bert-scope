tldr: This article investigates the thermal accommodation coefficients of gases like helium, neon, argon, hydrogen, and oxygen at room and liquid-oxygen temperatures. The authors found that the accommodation coefficients of inert gases vary approximately as the square root of their atomic weights. The study also examines the effect of temperature on the accommodation coefficients and how they depend on molecular weight.
