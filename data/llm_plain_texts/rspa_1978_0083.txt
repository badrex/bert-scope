tldr: The authors demonstrate that the Davey-Stewartson equation, which describes two-dimensional surface waves on water, can be solved using the inverse scattering method. They find soliton and multi-soliton solutions for the equation, which describe the interaction of solitons skewed in different directions. The study has implications for understanding nonlinear waves in fluid dynamics.
