tldr: The author explains the moon illusion phenomenon, where the moon appears larger when near the horizon than when at a higher position in the sky. He conducts an experiment with ivory balls to demonstrate that the illusion arises from our perception of the moon's distance and angle. The author suggests that our brain makes an error in judging the moon's distance, leading to the illusion of its size.
