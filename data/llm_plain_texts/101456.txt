tldr: The article discusses the invention and early experiments of injecting substances directly into the bloodstream by Dr. Christopher Wren. The method involved making ligatures on veins and injecting liquids through syringes or quills. The experiments were performed on dogs and later on a malefactor by a foreign ambassador. The invention was later practiced in Oxford and London, and Dr. Timothy Clerk further pursued these experiments with significant observations. The article highlights the contributions of Dr. Christopher Wren and Mr. Robert Boyle in the development of this technique.
