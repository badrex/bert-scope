revised_title: Non-Commutative Algebra and Projective Geometry
semantic_tags:
  - Algebra

  - Quadrangular Figures
tldr: This article explores the application of non-commutative algebra to the study of projective geometry, specifically focusing on the quadrangular figures studied by Hessenberg and Vahlen. The author develops a method for assigning numerical marks to points on lines and examines the properties of these marks in relation to the axioms of projective geometry. The article also discusses the transformation of points and lines in projective geometry and its implications for the study of quadrangles.
