tldr: The authors studied the rapid process of twinning in zinc and tin crystals using high-speed photography and a rotating mirror camera. They observed the initial lengthening of twins and their subsequent broadening, with speeds up to 780 for zinc and 35 for tin. The research provides insights into the kinetics of twinning and its implications for understanding dislocation mechanisms.
