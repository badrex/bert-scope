tldr: This study investigates the termination of fibers from the cerebral cortex and thalamus on dendritic spines in the caudate nucleus using the Golgi method. The researchers found that the density of dendritic spines varies with the distance from the cell body, with the first 20 Âµm length being spine-free. The distribution pattern of spines does not change after lesions in the cerebral cortex, thalamus, or both, but the overall number of spines decreases. This suggests that fibers from both regions end on spines of the same cells.
