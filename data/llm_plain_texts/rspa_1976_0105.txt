tldr: The article explores the interaction between a weak magnetic field and a slowly rotating black hole. The authors find that the component of angular momentum perpendicular to the magnetic field decreases exponentially with time, while the component parallel to the field remains constant. This causes the black hole's axis of rotation to gradually align with the magnetic field.
