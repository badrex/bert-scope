tldr: The author, John Arbuthnott, argues for the existence of divine providence through the constant regularity observed in the balance of male and female births. Using mathematical calculations and probability theory, he demonstrates that the equal number of males and females is not a result of chance but a deliberate design by a higher power. He also discusses the implications of this balance on polygamy and the propagation of the human race.
