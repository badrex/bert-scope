tldr: This article investigates the exchange of energy between a platinum surface and gas molecules. The authors study the accommodation coefficient, which measures the energy exchange between gas molecules and a surface, for various gases such as helium, neon, argon, hydrogen, and oxygen. They find that the coefficient varies with temperature, pressure, and the nature of the gas, and that the platinum surface becomes contaminated over time, affecting the energy exchange.
