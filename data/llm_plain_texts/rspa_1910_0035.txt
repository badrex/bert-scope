tldr: The author examines a case of red-blindness in a gentleman and confirms the sensation curves of green and blue obtained with his own eyes. The study supports the trichromatic theory of color vision, which states that humans perceive colors through three different color receptors. The author also investigates how color-blind individuals perceive colors and matches them with the white light, providing valuable insights into the understanding of color vision and its underlying mechanisms.
