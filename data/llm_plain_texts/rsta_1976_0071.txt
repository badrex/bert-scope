tldr: The authors conducted a study on calcite twin lamellae in experimental buckles and faulted drape-folds to analyze natural strain and geological structure. They found that the derived orientations and relative magnitudes of the principal strain axes from calcite twin lamellae agreed with the corresponding inferred principal stress axes. This study demonstrates the usefulness of twin lamellae in solving structural problems and understanding geological deformations.
