tldr: The authors present an exact solution for the diffraction of electromagnetic waves by a semi-infinite metallic sheet, considering two fundamental polarizations. They derive Wiener-Hopf integral equations and use the steepest descent method to determine the diffracted fields. The study provides a better understanding of the effect of finite conductivity on diffraction structures.
