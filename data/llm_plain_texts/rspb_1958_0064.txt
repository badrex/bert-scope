tldr: This study investigates the immunological responses of Syrian and Chinese hamsters to skin homografts. The results show that hamsters can reject homografts similarly to other mammals. The specificity of graft acceptance or rejection is investigated, revealing a multiplicity of transplantation isoantigens and individual specificity in the Syrian hamster. The effect of cortisone on skin homograft survival is also studied, showing that it can prolong the survival of certain homografts.
