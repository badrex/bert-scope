tldr: The study examines the functional anatomy and feeding adaptations of the large aquatic predator Rhomaleosaurus zetlandicus from the Lower Jurassic period. The research reconstructs the cranial musculature for the first time in plesiosaurs and analyzes the forces within the head to understand its feeding efficiency and structural strength. The findings reveal that the head of Rhomaleosaurus was adapted for feeding in water, with a unique combination of muscle systems that allowed it to efficiently capture and consume large prey.
