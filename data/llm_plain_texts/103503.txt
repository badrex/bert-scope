tldr: The author, Fr. Triewald, investigates the cause of cohesion in matter and the role of attraction forces in it. He conducts experiments with lead balls and discusses the strength of cohesion based on the closeness of contact between the particles. Triewald also explores the role of heat and fire in splitting stones and the use of fat and oily substances in this process. He supports the idea of a universal attraction between the particles of matter, as proposed by Sir Isaac Newton.
