tldr: The authors re-examined the dentition of the Carboniferous dipnoan Uronemus and found that its teeth and ridges are part of a highly modified tooth plate. This adaptation is linked to the fish's air-breathing capabilities and its unique feeding mechanism. The study also provides new data on other related genera, such as Scaumenacia, Phaneropleuron, and Rhinodipterus.
