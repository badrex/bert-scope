tldr: This study investigates the thermodynamics of intracrystalline sorption in faujasite-type crystals, focusing on the entropy of occlusion of argon and nitrogen. The authors analyze the partial molal entropies of these gases in various ion-exchanged forms of faujasite, providing insights into the translational, vibrational, and rotational states of sorbed molecules. The results show that the mobility of the sorbed gases is substantial, with wide amplitudes of vibration or short translational flights occurring in the intracrystalline system.
