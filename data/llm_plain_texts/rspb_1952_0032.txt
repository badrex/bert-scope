semantic_tags:
  - Biomechanics
  - Protein structure
  - Muscle contraction
  - Infra-red spectroscopy
  - Rubber-like elasticity
tldr: This article discusses the thermodynamics of elasticity in biological tissues, specifically focusing on the infra-red spectra of muscle. The authors explore the differences between flexible rubber molecules and folded polypeptide chains, and how these differences impact muscle elasticity. They also examine the mechanism of muscle contraction proposed by Pauling and Corey, observing two absorption bands in the spectrum of a complete muscle that could help distinguish between folded and extended polypeptide chains.
