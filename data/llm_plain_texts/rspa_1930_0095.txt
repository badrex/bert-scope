tldr: The authors studied the catalytic decomposition of diethyl ether by iodine, finding that the reaction occurs through two consecutive steps. They discovered that the kinetic equations of unimolecular consecutive reactions are followed, with the velocity constants being proportional to the iodine concentration. The catalyst seems to attack a complex molecule at one specific point, leading to a simpler and more efficient activation mechanism compared to the uncatalyzed reaction.
