tldr: The authors describe a method to generate voltaic electricity using atmospheric oxidation. They discovered that when a copper plate is immersed in an ammoniacal solution and connected to an aeration plate, a voltaic current is produced. This process involves the oxidation of copper to cuprous oxide, which is dissolved in the ammonia solution. The voltaic cell can maintain a constant electromotive force (EMF) and can be used to study the properties of the generated electricity.
