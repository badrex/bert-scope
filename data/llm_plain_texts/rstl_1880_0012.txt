tldr: The author conducted experiments on normal paraffins from mannite and petroleum, focusing on hexane and hexylene. They discovered that the hexylene obtained from mannite readily combines with hydrochloric acid in the cold, while the hexylene from petroleum requires heating. This suggests that petroleum contains an inextricable mixture of isomeric and homologous paraffins, with normal hydrocarbons predominating. Further research is needed to understand the constitution of olefines from petroleum and the reasons behind the differences in behavior between the two hexanes.
