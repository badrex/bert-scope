tldr: In May 1759, two astronomers, J. Bevis and Nicolas Munckley, observed and documented the appearance and movement of a comet. They compared their findings and concluded that the comet was the same one observed in 1682. They discussed the comet's position, size, and brightness, as well as its trajectory and relationship to the Earth and the Sun.
