tldr: The article discusses the role of activated solar filaments and flares in the Sun's activity and their impact on the heliosphere. It explains how filament disruptions can lead to enhanced mass-flow and reconnection of magnetic field lines, resulting in particle acceleration and the formation of coronal loops. Two-ribbon flares, which occur when a filament is activated within an active region, are described as the most powerful solar events, capable of accelerating particles to high energies and producing shock waves that can reach Earth.
