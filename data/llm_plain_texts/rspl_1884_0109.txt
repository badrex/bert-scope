tldr: The author discusses the discovery of sponge-bed formations in the Lower and Upper Greensand strata of the South of England. These beds are made up of detached spicular remains of siliceous sponges and vary in thickness from three-quarters of an inch to three feet. The sponge-beds are found in various locations, including the Wealden area, Isle of Wight, and southwestern counties. The author also compares these sponge-beds to similar formations in other regions, such as Westphalia, Ardennes, and Belgium.
