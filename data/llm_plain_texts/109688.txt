tldr: The author, William Herschel, investigates the cause of colored concentric rings and other similar appearances by examining the effects of surface curvature, prismatic reflection, and critical separation of colors. He demonstrates that these phenomena are related to the differences in refrangibility of colors and the angle of incidence of light. His findings challenge the idea of alternate fits of easy reflection and easy transmission as original properties in the rays of light.
