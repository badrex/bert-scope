tldr: This article examines the geological structures and fabrics in the Kunlun Shan region of Tibet, providing evidence for mid-Paleozoic deformation. The authors identify three tectonic units and discuss the geological features and faults that separate them. They propose that these units represent separate terranes or microplates, and that the faults mark sutures related to the geological history of the region.
