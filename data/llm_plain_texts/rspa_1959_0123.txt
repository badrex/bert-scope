tldr: The authors analyzed the ultra-violet spectra of hydrogen fluoride (HF) and deuterium fluoride (DF) molecules. They identified the emitter species as neutral or ionized HF and DF, and determined the vibrational and rotational constants for the molecules. This study provides valuable information about the electronic states and stabilities of these simple diatomic hydrides.
