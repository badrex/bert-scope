revised_title: 'Frictional Resistance of Elongated Bodies in Fluids: Effect of Section Form'

  - Resistance
tldr: The author investigates the effect of the form of the transverse section on the frictional resistance of elongated bodies moving parallel to their length through fluids. They examine the resistance offered by the walls of a circular pipe and propose a formula for calculating the resistance per unit area. The author also discusses the resistance of bodies immersed in fluid streams and the influence of projecting keels or ridges on that resistance.
