tldr: In February 1756, the River Thames experienced unusual tides with irregular ebbs and flows. The author, Robert Dingley, and others observed that the water level was much lower than expected, and the flood came and went unexpectedly. They attributed this to weak floods, yellow-colored water, and possible wind shifts. This phenomenon was significant because it affected shipping and other activities along the river.
