  - Expansive heat
tldr: The author explains the geometrical representation of the expansive action of heat and the theory of thermo-dynamic engines. He demonstrates how energy can be represented graphically and applies this to the study of heat and expansive power. The paper also discusses the efficiency of thermo-dynamic engines, including those using permanent gases and steam engines.
