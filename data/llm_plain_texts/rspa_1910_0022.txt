tldr: This article explores the distribution of temperature under and around mountain ranges in radioactive districts. The author presents a mathematical model to determine temperature distribution, considering factors like heat conductivity, radioactivity, and the curvature of the Earth's surface. The findings can help in understanding the formation of mountains and the movements of the Earth's crust.
