tldr: The author explores the Penrose transform for the ultrahyperbolic wave equation and demonstrates that a smooth solution can be represented locally by a twistor contour integral formula. This is used to rederive Asgeirsson's mean value theorem and discuss the global problem of constructing a twistor transform in the compactified space-time.
