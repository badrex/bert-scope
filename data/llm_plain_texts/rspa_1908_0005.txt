tldr: This study examines the magnetic declination at Kew Observatory from 1890 to 1900, analyzing the data from both ordinary and disturbed days. The research investigates the diurnal inequalities and the differences in the 24-hour term when analyzing Fourier series. The findings suggest that while theories about the origin of magnetic storms may be partially true, they cannot fully explain the observed phenomena. The study is based on over 100,000 actual curve readings and was partially funded by a government grant.
