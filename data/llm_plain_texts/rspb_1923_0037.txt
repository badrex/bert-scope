tldr: The author investigates the effects of mechanical conditions on the electrocardiogram by conducting experiments on isolated hearts of tortoises and dogs. They found that increased cardiac filling prolongs the period of rising tension, the duration of mechanical response, and the duration of electrical response, while decreasing the height of electrical response. These findings suggest that variations in the electrocardiogram occur due to changes in the heart's mechanical conditions, even when nervous influences are partially or completely eliminated.
