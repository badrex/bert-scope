tldr: The authors present an effective algorithm for solving Diophantine equations of the type f(x, y) = Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2, where f is an irreducible binary form with integer coefficients and degree at least 3. They investigate the size of the bound furnished by the algorithm for the solutions of the equation and obtain the first effective improvement on the result of Liouville concerning the accuracy with which algebraic numbers can be approximated by rationals.
