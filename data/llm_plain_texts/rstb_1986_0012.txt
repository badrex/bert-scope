tldr: The neutral theory of molecular evolution posits that most evolutionary changes at the DNA level are caused by random fixation of selectively neutral or nearly neutral mutants. This theory asserts that the majority of protein and DNA polymorphisms are maintained in species by mutational input balanced by random extinction. The author reviews recent DNA sequence data and discusses the implications of the neutral theory in light of these findings, including the role of neutral mutations in adaptive evolution.
