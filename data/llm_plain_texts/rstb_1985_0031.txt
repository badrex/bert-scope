tldr: This article discusses the neurochemistry of nociception, focusing on the role of neuropeptides and opioid peptides in pain perception. The authors explore various aspects of neuropeptide function, including their potential as biochemical markers and their possible involvement in sensory systems. They also emphasize the importance of further research into neuropeptide-containing systems and the development of selective and potent antagonists for different receptor subtypes.
