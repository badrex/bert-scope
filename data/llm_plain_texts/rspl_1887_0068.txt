tldr: The author discusses the properties of diameters in plane cubics, focusing on their envelopes and relationships with other curves. They explore the differences between elliptic and parabolic cubics, explaining how their properties change based on the nature of their centroid. This study provides a deeper understanding of the geometry and analysis of cubic curves.
