tldr: This study examines the life cycle and ecology of Plasmodium pitheci, a malaria parasite of orang-utans, and discovers a new malaria parasite, Plasmodium silvaticum. The researchers found that both parasites cause chronic infections in orang-utans and can be transmitted through blood and mosquito bites. The study also discusses the evolution of primate malarias and their relationship to their hosts, as well as the potential risks of these parasites infecting humans.
