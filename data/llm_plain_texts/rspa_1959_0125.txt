revised_title: 'Limiting Behavior of Atomic Wave Functions for Large Atomic Numbers'
semantic_tags:
  - Atomic Physics
  - Quantum Mechanics
  - Atomic Structure
  - Screening Numbers
  - Self-Consistent Field Calculations
tldr: 'The authors extend the study of the limiting behavior of atomic wave functions for large atomic numbers. They explore the relationship between the screening number and the series expansion of the wave function. The study includes configurations with up to 32 electrons and provides a method for interpolating atomic wave functions with respect to atomic number.'
