tldr: The authors re-examined the use of the manganese dioxide electrode to measure muscle acidity during contraction and found it to be unsatisfactory. They discovered a fault in their technique that invalidated previous conclusions about acid development in the muscle. This led to a reassessment of the method and its implications for investigating living tissues.
