tldr: The authors discovered that the Adamkiewicz reaction, which is used to detect the presence of carbohydrate groups in certain proteid derivatives, is influenced by impurities in the acetic acid used. They found that these impurities are necessary for the formation of the colored product and that different specimens of acetic acid yield the reaction with varying intensity. The authors also identified the reactive substance as a derivative of acetic acid itself.
