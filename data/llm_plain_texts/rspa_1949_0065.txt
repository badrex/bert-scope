tldr: This study investigates the activation of copper by successive oxidation and reduction with hydrogen and the effects of carbon monoxide on the surface properties of copper oxide. The authors measure the heats of adsorption of carbon monoxide and oxygen and the heat liberated during the catalytic reaction of carbon monoxide and oxygen on a cuprous oxide film. They also study the kinetics of the reactions and the electrical conductivity of thin oxide films during reduction with hydrogen, exploring the process of embrittlement and the effect of gas adsorption on conductivity.
