tldr: This article presents an effectively exact statistical theory for the three-body recombination process in the low-density region, focusing on positive and negative ions recombining in their parent gas. The authors calculate the change of energy rate coefficient describing collisions between atoms and ion pairs, providing valuable insights into the recombination process and its impact on ion pairs' internal energy.
