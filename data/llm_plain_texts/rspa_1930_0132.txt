tldr: The authors conducted a study on the molecular spectrum of hydrogen, focusing on the bands ending on 2p1U. They analyzed the rotational structure of the 2pXII levels for vibrational states corresponding to v" = 1, 2, and 3. The study provided insights into the atomic and molecular structure of hydrogen, contributing to the understanding of quantum mechanics and atomic physics.
