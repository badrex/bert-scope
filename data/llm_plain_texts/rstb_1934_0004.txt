tldr: The authors studied the conversion of one strain of Diaporthe perniciosa into another by examining the behavior of DHC and DHF in separate and associated cultures. They found that viable hyphal tips from the advancing mycelium of DHC usually develop into DHF, and minute fragments of older mycelium can also give rise to DHF when grown in fresh medium. This research provides insights into the factors responsible for the conversion of DHC into DHF.
