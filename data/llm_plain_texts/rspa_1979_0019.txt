tldr: The authors study the boundary layer equations for non-Newtonian fluids with a power law relationship between shear stress and strain rate. They focus on mass transfer in these fluids under conditions of similarity-preserving mass transfer at the wall. The study establishes existence, uniqueness, and analyticity of the solutions and provides insights into the behavior of these fluids in boundary layer applications.
