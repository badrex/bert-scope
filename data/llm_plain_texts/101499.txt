tldr: The author, Robert Boyle, describes a new type of baroscope, called the statical baroscope, which can measure changes in atmospheric pressure. By using a glass bubble and a counterweight, the statical baroscope can detect variations in the weight of the air, allowing for more accurate predictions of weather patterns and atmospheric conditions.
