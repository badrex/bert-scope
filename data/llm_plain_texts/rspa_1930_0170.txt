tldr: The authors studied the scattering of light in gelatin solutions and gels, observing changes in intensity and depolarization during the gelation process. They found that the extent of molecular dispersion in gelatin solutions depends on concentration, and that as the temperature decreases, molecular aggregates form, leading to increased light scattering. The authors also used ultramicroscopy to examine the process of gel-formation in gelatin solutions.
