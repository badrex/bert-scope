tldr: This article investigates the effects of solvents on the infrared spectra of hindered phenols, focusing on the phenomenon of molecular association. The authors find that increasing the complexity of the solvent or solute can increase the time between collisions, allowing for the detection of free OH absorptions in transit from one molecular association to another. This study provides insights into the behavior of phenols in different solvents and the factors influencing molecular association.
