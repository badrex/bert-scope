tldr: The author studied the process of spermatozoa entering the female reproductive system in Peripatopsis, a type of Onychophora. They discovered that spermatozoa are released from the spermatophore when the cuticle is eaten after ecdysis. The spermatozoa then travel through the body and reach the ovary, where they help in the early development of ova. This research provides insights into the reproductive biology of Onychophora.
