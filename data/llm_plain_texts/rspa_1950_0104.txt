  - Equivalent Orbitals
tldr: This article explores the properties of equivalent orbitals in the molecular orbital theory of chemical valency. It examines the symmetry properties of these orbitals and their significance in the context of molecular structure. The authors prove several theorems related to the symmetry of equivalent orbitals and their definition in a molecule, demonstrating the importance of group theory in understanding these properties.
