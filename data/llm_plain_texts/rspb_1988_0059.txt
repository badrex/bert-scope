tldr: 'This study investigates the effects of manganese ions on intracellular granules in snails, leading to localized corrosion and release of calcium ions. This corrosion overwhelms the calcium-regulatory mechanisms of the cells, causing their death and shedding into the alimentary tract. The findings provide insights into the novel interpretation of a biochemical lesion involving intracellular corrosion.'
