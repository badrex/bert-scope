tldr: The authors discovered a pigment present in the sweat and urine of certain sheep, which they named "Lanaurin." They isolated the pigment from the wool yolk and urine, studying its properties and relationship to bilirubin and the metabolism of hemoglobin. Lanaurin is a golden-brown pigment that appears in varying intensities in the excretions surrounding the wool fibers of many sheep. The authors found that it is secreted with the sweat and is chemically inert and stable.
