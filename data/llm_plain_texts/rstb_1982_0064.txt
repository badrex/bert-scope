tldr: This article discusses the role of methanogenic bacteria in the conversion of organic compounds to methane in anaerobic environments. It explores the various microbial partnerships and interactions that occur during the fermentation process, highlighting the importance of methanogens in the overall conversion of substrates to methane. The article also describes the unique aceticlastic reaction, in which acetate is converted to methane and carbon dioxide, and the various types of microbial partnerships involved in the process.
