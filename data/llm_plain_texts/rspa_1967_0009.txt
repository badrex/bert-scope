tldr: The authors conducted microwave ultrasonic studies in a highly coupled superconductor, niobium, and found that the energy gap parameter is anisotropic, having minima in the directions of high symmetry. The results can be used to deduce a heat capacity jump at the superconducting transition temperature, which is higher than the BCS weak coupling value. Similar measurements in vanadium show normal BCS behavior.
