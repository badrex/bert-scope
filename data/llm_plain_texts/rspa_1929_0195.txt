tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the crystal structure of ice using X-ray diffraction. They found that the positions of the diffracting centers in the unit cell of ice have been determined with great certainty. The structure was tested at various temperatures between 0°C and -183°C, providing insights into the physical properties of ice and its constitution. The research aimed to eliminate the uncertainty regarding the structure and crystallography of ice, which could be valuable for understanding problems related to the physical properties of ice, the flow of glaciers, and anomalous meteorological haloes.
