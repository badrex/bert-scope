tldr: The study examines diurnal changes in stratification and photosynthesis in three shallow African waters, controlled by thermal stratification. The research focuses on the effects of photosynthesis on phytoplankton in tropical freshwaters, providing insights into primary productivity in these habitats. The findings reveal that these waters have strong diurnal changes in temperature and density stratification, which affect the vertical distribution of photosynthesis-related changes.
