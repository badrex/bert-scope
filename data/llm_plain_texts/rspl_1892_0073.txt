tldr: The authors conducted a study on the wandering cells of frogs, examining their structure, behavior, and functions, particularly in relation to microorganisms. They discovered three types of wandering cells and observed their response to various stimuli, such as the injection of anthrax bacilli. The study also revealed the process of leukocytosis and the role of eosinophile and hyaline cells in combating microorganisms.
