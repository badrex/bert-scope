tldr: This article presents experiments and theoretical work on the variation of electrical conductivity with size in metals, focusing on sodium. The authors observed a size effect in electrical resistance and developed a theoretical analysis based on the statistical theory of metals. They also discovered a new phenomenon where the application of transverse and longitudinal magnetic fields significantly alters the electrical resistance in sodium specimens.
