tldr: In November 1843, a fall of aerolites occurred on the coast of Barbary, accompanied by a brilliant stream of light extending from Tunis to Tripoli. The event caused alarm among the inhabitants, and the British Consulate in Tunis was flooded with people seeking refuge. This event was followed by the coldest winter in years. The Royal Society received a letter from Mr. Richardson detailing the incident, and a paper on meteorological observations in India was also discussed.
