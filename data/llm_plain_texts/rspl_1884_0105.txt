tldr: This article investigates the effect of different chlorides on the solubility of calcium sulfate in water. The authors found that the solubility of calcium sulfate increases in the presence of sodium or ammonium chloride, but decreases when calcium chloride is present. The study also explores the influence of magnesium chloride on the solubility of calcium sulfate.
