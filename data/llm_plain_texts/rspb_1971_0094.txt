tldr: The article discusses the potential of higher plants, specifically tropical grasses, to achieve optimal photosynthesis in artificial environments using the phosphopyruvic acid cycle. The author explains how certain plants can resist inhibition by high oxygen concentrations, which is associated with their unique leaf anatomy, dimorphic chloroplasts, and an ancillary mechanism for trapping carbon dioxide. The author concludes that plants like sugar cane could produce the highest yield of organic material in artificial environments.
