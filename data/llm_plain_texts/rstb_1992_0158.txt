  - Bacterial evolution

  - Genetic fluidity

tldr: This article discusses the unique ability of certain bacteria to fix nitrogen, a process that has sustained the nitrogen economy of the biosphere for half a billion years. The author explores why this ability has not spread to higher organisms, such as plants, and examines the genetic fluidity and gene exchange processes in bacteria that contribute to their evolution.
