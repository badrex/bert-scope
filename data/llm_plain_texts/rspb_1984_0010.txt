tldr: The article explores the function of internodal potassium channels in myelinated nerve fibers, specifically their role in maintaining a resting potential under the myelin sheath. This resting potential is crucial for the stability of the nodal resting potential and the security of nerve conduction. The importance of these channels increases in smaller diameter fibers, as they help stabilize the nodal resting potential and prevent impairment of conduction.
