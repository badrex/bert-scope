tldr: The author conducted experiments on an internal combustion engine to study the specific heat and heat flow of the working fluid within the cylinder. They developed a method to measure these properties directly, which involved subjecting the heated products of combustion to alternate compression and expansion. The results provided insights into the mean specific heat of the gas and the law of heat flow, which can be applied to improve engine efficiency.
