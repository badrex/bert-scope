tldr: The authors conducted an experiment using a Michelson interferometer to investigate the effect of a transverse magnetic field on the velocity of light in vacuum. They found that the sensitivity of their method allowed them to observe small changes in the interference bands, which could be used to measure the impact of the magnetic field on the light's velocity. This research improved the understanding of the interaction between light and magnetic fields, which could have implications for various scientific and technological applications.
