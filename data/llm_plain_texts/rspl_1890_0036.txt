tldr: The authors discovered a unique type of plasticity in ice crystals, which behaves like an infinite number of thin, inextensible sheets of paper fastened together with a viscous substance. This plasticity allows ice crystals to bend and change shape under certain conditions, with the rate of distortion being irregular and influenced by temperature. The findings have implications for understanding the behavior of ice in geological and geophysical contexts.
