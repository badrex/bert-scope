tldr: This article investigates the non-radial oscillations of slowly rotating stars caused by the Lense-Thirring effect. The authors establish the theoretical result that these oscillations should occur in neutron stars and could potentially be observed. The study contributes to our understanding of the behavior of stars and the effects of rotation on their space-time.
