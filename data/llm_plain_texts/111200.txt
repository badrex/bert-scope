tldr: The author, William Brinton, studied the dentate body of the cerebellum and its anatomical structure. He concluded that the dentate body forms a tubular investment around the extremity of the processus e cerebello ad testem, connected with the opposite body by a commissure of grey matter. The dentate body receives fibers from the cerebro-cerebellar peduncle and radiates fibers to the various lobes of the cerebellum. Brinton suggests that the dentate body's anatomical structure and relations are best understood as a cerebrocerebellar ganglion.
