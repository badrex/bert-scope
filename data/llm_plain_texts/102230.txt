tldr: The author, Edward Tyson, conducted an anatomical study on the round worm (Lumbricus teres) found in human bodies. He observed the differences in the reproductive organs of male and female worms and discovered that they are vastly different from those of common earthworms. Tyson also discussed the function of the worms' muscles, movement, and the presence of eggs in the female worms. This study provides valuable insights into the anatomy and biology of parasitic worms.
