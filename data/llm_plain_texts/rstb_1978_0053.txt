tldr: This article examines the changes in the topography and ecology of Low Isles and Three Isles in the Great Barrier Reef over a 45-year period. The study reveals alterations in island shape, size, and location of shingle ramparts, which affect coral growth on reef flats. Mangroves have expanded significantly at Low Isles but not at Three Isles. These findings challenge previous models of island evolution and contribute to the understanding of the Holocene history of the Great Barrier Reef.
