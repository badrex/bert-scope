tldr: This study examines the phylogenetic relationships of the thylacine (Thylacinus cynocephalus) among dasyuroid marsupials using mitochondrial cytochrome b DNA sequences. The results suggest that the thylacine is a sister group to Dasyuridae, supporting the hypothesis that Thylacinus represents an ancient Australian marsupial lineage. The study also provides insights into the relationships within the Dasyuridae family.
