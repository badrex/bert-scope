tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the stability of viscous flow between rotating cylinders by measuring the torque transmitted to the outer cylinder. They found that the onset of instability is characterized by a discontinuity in the effective viscosity. The results agree with the theoretical predictions for both narrow and wide annular gaps. Detailed torque measurements were made to test the predictions of the theory beyond the onset of instability.
