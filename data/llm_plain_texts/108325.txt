tldr: The author, Henry Bence Jones, conducted a study on the variations in earthy and alkaline phosphates in urine, focusing on their relationship with diseases affecting the nervous system. The research found that the variations in phosphates were independent of the nature of the disease and that there was no increase in phosphates in chronic diseases of the brain or in cases of general paralysis. The study also showed that acute inflammation of the brain led to an excessive amount of phosphates being secreted, while in other functional diseases or fevers, no excess was observed.
