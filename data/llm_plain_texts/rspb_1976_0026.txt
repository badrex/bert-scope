tldr: The study examines the conductance changes produced by L-glutamate, L-aspartate, and L-cysteate at the excitatory junctional membrane of the squid. The researchers found that all three amino acids cause similar elementary conductance events, but with different average lifetimes. The results provide insights into the post-synaptic actions of these putative excitatory transmitter substances.
