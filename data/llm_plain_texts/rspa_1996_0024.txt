tldr: This article presents a multiphysics model for the metals casting process, addressing fluid flow, heat transfer, and solidification. The model uses novel finite volume unstructured mesh techniques and is applied to predict shape deformation and porosity formation in solidifying metal components. The research aims to develop computational tools for the foundry industry to design casting processes and improve casting quality.
