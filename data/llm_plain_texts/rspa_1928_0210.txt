tldr: The author modifies Schottky's equation to account for the influence of neighboring electrons in the interaction of particles according to the inverse square law. The study focuses on the changes in velocities of particles moving through a cloud of particles and the effective mean free paths. The findings may explain the rapid rate at which beams of electrons in highly ionized gases take up Maxwellian velocity distributions.
