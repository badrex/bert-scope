tldr: The author, John Ellicott, describes an instrument for measuring the degrees of expansion of metals by heat. The device consists of a brass plate with a standard bar and two levers, each with a chain and weight. As the metal bar heats and expands, the levers move, turning an index to measure the degree of expansion. This allows for the comparison of expansion rates for different metals under the same heat conditions.
