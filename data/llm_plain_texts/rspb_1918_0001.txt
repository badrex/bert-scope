revised_title: 'Enzymes and Decomposition of Glucose and Mannitol by Bacillus coli communis'
semantic_tags:
  - Bacterial metabolism
  - Enzyme action
  - Glucose decomposition
  - Mannitol decomposition
  - Bacterial fermentation
tldr: 'The author conducted experiments to study the enzymes involved in the decomposition of glucose and mannitol by Bacillus coli communis. They developed a new method to separate the process of growth from fermentation, using an emulsion of the bacteria to decompose glucose and mannitol. This research provided insights into the bacterial fermentation process and the role of enzymes in breaking down sugars.'
