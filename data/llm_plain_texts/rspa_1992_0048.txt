tldr: The authors studied the melting parameters and transport coefficients in halide salts of monovalent, divalent, and trivalent metals. They found that most halides follow an approximate linear relationship between entropy change and relative volume change on melting. However, some systems, such as fast-ion conductors, strongly structured network-like systems, and molecular systems, show a deficit of entropy of melting. The authors discuss these deviations in correlation with structural and transport data, providing insights into the behavior of these unique systems.
