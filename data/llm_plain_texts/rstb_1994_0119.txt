tldr: The authors re-examined haramiyid teeth from Holwell Quarry and Saint-Nicolas-de-Port to understand their dental organization and relationships. They concluded that Haramiya and Thomasia were likely upper and lower teeth, respectively, and discussed their possible relationships to multituberculates and other mammalian groups. The study provides insights into the evolution and classification of early mammals.
