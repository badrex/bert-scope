tldr: This study investigates faceted void-like defects, called voidites, found in natural diamonds using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The researchers discovered that voidites occur in sheets parallel to {100} planes and can be found in partial platelets and dislocation loops. They also discuss the possible processes of voidite formation and propose reactions involving platelets and voidites.
