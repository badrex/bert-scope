tldr: The authors present a method for solving elliptic differential equations with boundary conditions involving derivatives using finite-difference techniques. They discuss the general principles of the method, establish relevant finite-difference formulae, and provide numerical examples for both rectangular and curved boundaries. This method improves the accuracy and efficiency of solving these types of equations.
