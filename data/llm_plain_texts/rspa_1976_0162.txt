tldr: The authors extended the molecular field theory of liquid crystalline mixtures to investigate phase separation in binary mixtures of rods and spheres. They found that the addition of a spherical solute to a liquid crystal depresses the transition from the isotropic to the nematic phase, and that the two-phase region consists of both nematic and isotropic phases. This theory is in agreement with experimental observations and provides a better understanding of the role of anisotropic interactions in liquid crystal formation.
