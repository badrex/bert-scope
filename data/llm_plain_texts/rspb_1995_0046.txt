tldr: The study investigates the sperm storage and genetic diversity in female damselflies, specifically in the species Calopteryx splendens xanthostoma. The researchers found that females have discrete sperm storage organs, and that females who engage in'stealing a guard' behavior have a higher genetic diversity of stored sperm than those who mate and are guarded. This suggests that females may have the potential to exercise post-copulatory choice based on the observed patterns of sperm precedence, genetic variation in stored sperm, and the avoidance of remating in some cases.
