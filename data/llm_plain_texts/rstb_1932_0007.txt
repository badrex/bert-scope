tldr: The author discusses the correlation between skull and brain form and how external factors, such as mechanical influences and environmental pressures, can affect brain development. They provide examples from lower vertebrates like Teleostomes and birds, highlighting the influence of compression and pressure on the brain's shape and structure. The author emphasizes the importance of considering these factors when studying the differences in brain morphology among various species and races.
