tldr: The authors discovered that locusts require dietary ascorbic acid for normal growth and development. They found that without ascorbic acid, growth is noticeably retarded, and mortality is particularly associated with the final moult. The optimal concentration of ascorbic acid in the diet for both Schistocerca gregaria and Locusta migratoria is between 0.14 and 1.4 mg per gram of diet.
