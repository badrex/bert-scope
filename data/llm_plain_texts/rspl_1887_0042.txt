tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the magnetization of iron in strong magnetic fields. They found that iron can reach a magnetic induction of up to 32,360 when subjected to a strong magnetic field. The author also observed that the residual magnetism in the iron samples was relatively constant within the tested range of magnetic forces.
