tldr: The article examines the changes in membrane structure and composition during the secretory pathway in polypeptide-secreting cells. It reveals that as membranes move from the forming to the maturing pole of the Golgi apparatus, they lose protein content and gain cholesterol. The study provides insights into the specialized functions required for proper membrane interactions during secretion.
