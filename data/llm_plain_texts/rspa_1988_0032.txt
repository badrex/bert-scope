tldr: This article presents a detailed study of Nitrogen-14 quadrupole cross-relaxation spectroscopy, a technique used to detect quadrupole-resonance signals in hydrogen-containing solids. The method involves polarizing the spin system in a high magnetic field, reducing it adiabatically to a lower value, and measuring the residual magnetic resonance signal after returning to the higher field. The technique has high sensitivity and can be applied to various nitrogen-containing compounds, providing valuable insights into their molecular structures and properties.
