tldr: The authors studied the intramolecular isotope effect in the pyrolysis of 1-14C propane. They found that the carbon-carbon bond involving the heavy carbon atom breaks less frequently than the normal carbon bond. The results indicate that bonds break about 8% more frequently than bonds in the pyrolysis of 1-14C propane. The isotope effect is independent of temperature and is the same whether the reaction occurs in the presence or absence of nitric oxide.
