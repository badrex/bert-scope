tldr: The article discusses how binary pulsars can serve as unique laboratories to study the strong-field regime of relativistic gravity. It reviews two approaches to using binary pulsar measurements as probes of relativistic gravity: the phenomenological (parametrized post-keplerian) formalism and the alternative theory approach. The experimental constraints derived from actual timing observations of three binary pulsars are summarized, and general relativity is found to pass these new, strong-field tests with complete success.
