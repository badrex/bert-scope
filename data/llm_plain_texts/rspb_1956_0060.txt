tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the reversion and selection of D-arabinose positive strains in coliform bacteria. They found that the reversion of trained cells was more rapid and complete in media containing acetate or succinate. The results showed that the reversion was a true process and not a selection of initial contamination, which could be due to the appearance of intermediate forms between the A+ and A- strains.
