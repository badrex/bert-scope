tldr: Benjamin Count of Rumford conducted an experiment to determine the source of heat generated by friction. He found that a large amount of heat could be produced by the friction between a blunt steel borer and the bottom of a hollow metallic cylinder, without any fire or combustion. This discovery demonstrated the potential for mechanical devices to generate heat through friction, without the need for fire, light, or chemical reactions.
