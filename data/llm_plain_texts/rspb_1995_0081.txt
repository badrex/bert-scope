tldr: This study examines the relationship between endocrine-immune interactions, ornaments, and mate choice in red jungle fowl. Female red jungle fowl prefer males with longer, redder combs, and the authors find that individual variation in comb length is positively correlated with plasma testosterone levels. Males with longer combs have fewer circulating lymphocytes, suggesting that the maintenance of secondary sexual characters may be costly to the immune system. The study explores the connection between testosterone and immune system parameters, as well as the potential costs and trade-offs of maintaining high hormone levels during the breeding season.
