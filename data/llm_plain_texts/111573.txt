tldr: The author examines the electrical aspects of muscular action and nerve currents. They discuss the relationship between the muscular current and the nerve current during contraction, and how the muscular current weakens during contraction. The author also explores the effects of the galvanic current on the muscular current and the differences between the reactions of the uninterrupted nerve current and the induced or secondary currents.
