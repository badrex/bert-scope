tldr: The authors discovered that short hair cells in the chick's cochlea have a transient potassium current (I_A) that is not present in tall hair cells. This current is sensitive to 4-aminopyridine and plays a role in the high-frequency response of the hair cell by decreasing membrane resistance. The findings could be important for understanding the function of short hair cells, which are similar to mammalian outer hair cells.
