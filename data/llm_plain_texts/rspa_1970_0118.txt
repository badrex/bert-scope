tldr: The authors measured the specific heats of plutonium and neptunium metals from 13 K to 300 K. Both metals have high electronic specific heats, with plutonium showing a small anomaly at around 60 K, possibly due to magnetic ordering. Neptunium's specific heat is a smooth function over the entire temperature range. The results provide information on the electronic, lattice, and thermodynamic properties of these transuranic elements.
