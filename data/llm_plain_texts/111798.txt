tldr: The author, James Jago, presents a revised view on the structure of the vitreous body in the eye. He now believes that the arborescent system consists of cell-constituted filaments rather than tubes filled with globules or cells. This structure helps prevent damage to the eye during movements and maintains proper circulation in the retinal vessels.
