tldr: Dr. Marcet's research aimed to understand the salt balance in the Mediterranean Sea. He collected water samples from various depths and distances from the Straits of Gibraltar. The samples showed that denser water at greater depths had a higher salt content. This finding suggests that a countercurrent beneath the surface could carry an equal amount of salt from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic, preventing a perpetual increase in salinity in the Mediterranean Sea.
