tldr: The authors conducted various experiments to explore the convertibility of substances from conductors to non-conductors of the electric fluid. They discovered that certain substances, such as calcined metals and ashes, can change from conductors to non-conductors when transformed into powders or exposed to heat. This finding sheds light on the complex nature of electricity and the properties of different materials.
