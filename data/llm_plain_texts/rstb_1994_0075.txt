tldr: The authors applied machine learning, specifically inductive logic programming through the program Golem, to analyze and predict protein secondary structure, identify rules for three-dimensional folding of proteins, and develop quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) for drug design. Golem derived rules that provided insights into the stereochemistry of the systems, demonstrating the potential of machine learning combined with human intervention in discovering patterns in biological sequences and structures.
