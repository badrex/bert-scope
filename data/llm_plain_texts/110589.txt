tldr: Michael Faraday designed a new instrument called the Differential Inductometer to measure the inductive powers of various dielectrics. The instrument consists of three circular brass plates and two gold leaves suspended in a glass jar. By adjusting the size, distance, and positioning of the plates and leaves, Faraday aimed to create a versatile tool for studying the inductive properties of materials, including crystals and diamonds.
