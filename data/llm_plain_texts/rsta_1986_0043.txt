tldr: The article discusses the importance of understanding three-dimensional protein structures for designing new molecules. It describes knowledge-based techniques, such as molecular dynamics and energy minimization, to predict the effects of site-specific mutations, insertions, and deletions in proteins. The authors emphasize the use of existing protein data to create accurate models for new protein designs, focusing on engineering amino-acid replacements, insertions, and deletions.
