tldr: The authors investigate the properties of catalase haematin, a unique iron-porphyrin compound found in catalase enzyme preparations. They study its absorption spectrum, comparing it to other haematin compounds, and determine that the catalase haematin is present in a bound form. The authors also examine the effects of various substances on the catalase haematin, such as sodium hydrosulfite and potassium ferricyanide, and discuss the potential implications for understanding the enzyme's function.
