tldr: This article investigates the generation of aerodynamic surface sound from a turbulent boundary layer. The author derives an integral theorem that relates the motion of a fluid around a rigid body to the stress distribution on the surface. The study focuses on an infinite flat plate in a uniform stream, showing that a finite dipole radiation per unit area is produced, which decreases with distance down the plate.
