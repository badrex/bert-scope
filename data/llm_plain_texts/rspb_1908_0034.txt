  - Chemical reactions
tldr: The author investigates the action of resin and allied bodies on photographic plates in the dark. They discover that certain resins can create a dark picture on the plate when in contact or proximity, and that this action can be influenced by temperature, light exposure, and the presence of oxygen. The author also finds that the activity of resin can be transferred to non-active materials, and that the action can be diminished or destroyed by certain chemicals like sulfur dioxide.
