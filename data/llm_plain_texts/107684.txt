tldr: The author, William Scoresby, conducted experiments to determine the effect of percussion on the development of magnetic properties in steel and iron. He discovered that the magnetizing effects of percussion could be significantly increased by hammering the steel bar while it rested on a magnetic iron or steel rod. The experiments showed that the magnetism in steel and iron could be developed and manipulated through various methods of percussion and contact with other magnetic materials.
