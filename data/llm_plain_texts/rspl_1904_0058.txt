semantic_tags:
  - Metal optics
  - Color in materials
  - Thin films
  - Metal nanoparticles
  - Optical properties of materials
tldr: This article explores the colors in metal glasses and metallic films, focusing on the optical properties and the effects of metal particles' size, shape, and distribution. The authors explain the color phenomena in gold, silver, and copper glasses, as well as the color changes in metal films upon heating or exposure to radiation. They also discuss the potential applications of these findings in the manufacturing of colored glass and the understanding of metal crystallization.
