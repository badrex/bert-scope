revised_title: 'Proteins and Mechanisms of Mammalian Smooth Muscle Contraction'
semantic_tags:
  - Muscle Contraction
  - Actomyosin
  - Tropomyosin
  - Smooth Muscle
  - Proteins
tldr: The authors discuss the physical and chemical basis of muscular contraction in mammalian smooth muscle. They analyze the proteins involved in the contractile mechanism, focusing on actomyosin and tropomyosin, and their possible location within the cell. They also explore the differences between smooth muscle and skeletal muscle actomyosin, including the role of ATPase activity and the presence of tonoactomyosin.
