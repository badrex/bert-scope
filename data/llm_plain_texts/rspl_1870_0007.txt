tldr: The author conducted observations using the Great Melbourne Telescope and analyzed the spectra of stars and nebulae. They discovered that the red line in the spectrum of the star in Argus is a real hydrogen line. The author also examined other stars and nebulae, finding that most of them did not show any condensation in their spectra. Additionally, the author observed an aurora and saw four known spectral lines, with a possibility of a red line at the end of the spectrum.
