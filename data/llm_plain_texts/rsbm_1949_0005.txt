tldr: Arthur Stewart Eve was a pioneering scientist in the field of radioactivity and geophysics. He worked closely with Ernest Rutherford and made significant contributions to the understanding of radiation, including the discovery of secondary and beta-rays from primary alpha-rays, the measurement of radium in rocks and sea-water, and the determination of radioactive material in the atmosphere. His work on cosmic rays and their effects on ionization in the air helped shape the understanding of these phenomena in the early 20th century.
