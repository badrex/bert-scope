tldr: Researchers studied the forelimb biomechanics of Megatherium americanum, a large ground sloth, and concluded that it was an efficient stabber. The animal's large, powerful claws and triceps muscle allowed it to generate enough force to penetrate soft tissues. This finding challenges the traditional view of ground sloths as ecologically uniform and suggests that they may have had more diverse habits and diets than previously thought.
