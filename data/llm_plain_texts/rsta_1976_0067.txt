tldr: This article discusses the evaluation of finite strain in naturally deformed rocks using natural strain indicators, such as ellipsoidal iron-reduction bodies. The authors establish the relation between measured finite strain and anisotropy resulting from deformation, including degree of preferred orientation, magnetic susceptibility anisotropy, and seismic anisotropy. They apply four independent methods to investigate strain in the Cambrian Slate Belt of Wales, providing insights into the relationship between strain variation and large-scale geological structure.
