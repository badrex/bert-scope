tldr: The authors studied the stability of the Blasius boundary layer, focusing on the upper branch and non-parallel flow effects. They found a five-zoned structure for the disturbance solution and determined the influence of non-parallelism on the neutral stability criteria. The results suggest that linear non-parallel flow stability theory can explain most experimental observations related to boundary layer stability.
