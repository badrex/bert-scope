semantic_tags:
  - Soliton solutions
  - Double sine Gordon equation
  - Photosynthesis models
  - In vitro models
  - Corrigenda
tldr: This article contains corrections for two previous publications. The first correction is for a paper on the double sine Gordon equation, where the exponent of P in two equations is adjusted. The second correction is for a paper on in vitro models for photosynthesis, where a wavelength value is corrected.
