tldr: This study examines the dimensions and variations of the cochlea in mammals, finding that the typical number of turns is around 2.5. The cochlea's size correlates with the organism's overall dimensions, and the number of turns does not affect other dimensions. The study also identifies a correlation between the rate of curvature of the spiral and the size of the cochlea.
