tldr: Researchers have developed an NMR microscope with a 11.7 T operating frequency to generate high-resolution images of cellular structures in plant systems. The images reveal the effects of local magnetic susceptibility differences inside the sample, which can be used to study plant stem structures and improve understanding of their properties.
