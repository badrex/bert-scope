tldr: The author investigates the mechanism of respiration and the role of the diaphragm in retaining supplemental air in the lungs. They discovered that the passive tension of the diaphragm is essential for limiting the encroachment of abdominal viscera on the thoracic cavity and maintaining the heart's movement during respiration. The diaphragm's tension also helps in restoring equilibrium after a deep expiration.
