tldr: The authors study the etching of crystal cleavages in mica, focusing on the effects of hydrofluoric acid. They discover two types of etch pits, small and large, and find a one-to-one correspondence between the localization and shapes of the isolated pits on oppositely matched cleavages. The mechanism of the formation of the isolated pits is discussed, attributing them to impurities. The study sheds light on the etching process and the role of crystal defects in the formation of etch patterns.
