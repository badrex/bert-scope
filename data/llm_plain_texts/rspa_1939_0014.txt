tldr: The authors develop a statistical theory for the adsorption of double molecules on solid surfaces, considering the interactions between adsorbed atoms and the critical temperature. They find that attractive forces between adsorbed molecules lead to a critical temperature, where adsorption can have a discontinuity. This study is relevant to understanding the behavior of gases consisting of double molecules and their interactions with surfaces.
