tldr: The author investigates the interaction between a rotating, spherical shell of matter and a central black hole. They apply Chrzanowski's method, which involves horizon multipole moments, to calculate the spin-down law for the black hole. The study shows similarities and differences to known laws describing the response of a black hole to scalar and electromagnetic fields. The research is relevant to understanding the behavior of black holes in the presence of external elements that break their symmetry.
