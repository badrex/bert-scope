tldr: The authors studied the distribution of pig plasma amine oxidase or a related enzyme in various porcine tissues using immunofluorescence histochemistry. They found that a protein with the same immunological determinant as pig plasma amine oxidase is present in the connective tissue of all organs studied. This discovery highlights the close relationship between plasma and connective tissue amine oxidases.
