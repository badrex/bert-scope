tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the existence of intermetallic compounds in the vapour state of alkali metals. They used spectroscopy to analyze the absorption spectra of mixtures of metallic vapours and found that the alkali metals at their boiling points contain not more than 5% and probably only about 2% of molecules of the type M2. This discovery helps in understanding the properties of intermetallic compounds in vapour state.
