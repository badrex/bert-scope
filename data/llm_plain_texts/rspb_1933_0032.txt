tldr: The authors discovered a unique type of ray cell in certain woods, where the side walls are perforated, connecting two vertical series of vessel segments on opposite sides of a ray. This phenomenon occurs in 74 species from 17 different families. The anatomy of these woods is discussed in relation to the occurrence of this type of cell, and it is suggested that the factor of importance in determining the frequency of perforated ray cells is the relative proportions of the marginal ray cells and the vessels.
