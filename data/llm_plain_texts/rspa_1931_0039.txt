revised_title: Finiteness of Class Number for Indefinite Quadratic Forms
semantic_tags:
  - Quadratic Forms
  - Number Theory
  - Hermite's Method
  - Minkowski's Proof
  - Ternary Forms
tldr: The author investigates the properties of indefinite quadratic forms in variables, focusing on the case of forms with at least five variables. They discuss the methods of reduction by Hermite and Minkowski, and provide a simplified proof for the finiteness of the class number for these forms.
