tldr: This study investigates the tensile properties of copper-aluminum alloy crystals, focusing on the effects of coring and slip-planes on their deformation and distortion. The results show that the copper-aluminum alloy behaves similarly to brass crystals, with both materials exhibiting greater ductility than pure copper. The study also highlights the role of alloying elements in facilitating slip and the impact of non-homogeneous structure on the material's properties.
