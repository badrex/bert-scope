tldr: This article discusses the author's observations of horizontal refractions and their effect on the appearance of terrestrial objects and the horizon of the sea. The author explains how evaporation causes a less refraction near the surface of the sea, leading to objects appearing elevated above the horizon. The author also provides a theory and observations of this phenomenon, using a vessel as an example to explain the refraction of light in horizontal refractions.
