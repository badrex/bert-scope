tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the force of fired gunpowder and the initial velocities of cannon balls. They used a pendulum experiment to measure the impact of the ball, which helped calculate the actual velocities of the shot. This research was important for understanding the effects of gunpowder and improving cannon design.
