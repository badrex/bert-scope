tldr: This study investigates the ability of various carbon compounds to support the growth of Bact. ladis aerogenes. The bacteria are classified into three categories based on their adaptation to different carbon sources. The research also examines the relationship between these categories and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The findings provide insights into the multiple growth mechanisms and the role of carboxylic acids in bacterial growth.
