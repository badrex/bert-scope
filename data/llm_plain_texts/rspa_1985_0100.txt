tldr: This paper discusses the qualitative properties of natural frequencies and principal modes in various vibrating systems, such as taut strings, non-uniform rods, beams, and membranes. It explores the distinctness of natural frequencies, interlacing of frequencies corresponding to different end conditions, nodal patterns, and the reconstruction of systems from natural frequency or principal mode data. The paper also briefly describes the use of finite element models for analyzing continuous vibrating systems.
