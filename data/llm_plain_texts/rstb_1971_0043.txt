tldr: The article discusses the freeze-etching technique, a method used in electron microscopy to study membrane structure. The authors explore the differences in membrane structure and function, as well as the asymmetry between the two faces of a membrane. They also examine the role of electron microscopy in understanding the composition and molecular configurations within biological membranes, providing insights into membrane biology.
