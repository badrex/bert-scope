tldr: The authors developed a technique called pulsed photolysis to study radical reactions by using a sequence of light pulses. They applied this method to the photolysis of acetone and obtained absolute rate constants for competing radical-abstraction reactions and dimerization reactions. This technique allows for more accurate measurements of rate constants and can be used to study reactions among hot radicals.
