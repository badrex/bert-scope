revised_title: Superstring Theories and Low-Energy Physics
semantic_tags:
  - String Theory
  - Supersymmetry

  - Quantum Field Theory
  - Superstring Phenomenology
tldr: This article discusses the physics of superstring theories and their implications for low-energy physics. It explores the stages of symmetry breaking and compactification that occur between the Planck scale and the scale probed in the laboratory, and how these stages obscure the underlying string physics. The article also examines the expectations of string theories for low-energy physics and how specific attempts have been made to create a realistic low-energy theory.
