tldr: This article discusses the clinical and pathological aspects of kinins in human health. Kinins, such as bradykinin and kallidin, are formed in blood plasma and play a role in the inflammatory response. They have powerful actions on the cardiovascular system, smooth muscle, and pain receptors. The author explores various ways the kinin-forming system can be triggered in pathological states, such as acute pancreatitis, gouty arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, bronchial asthma, migraine, and other conditions.
