tldr: This article discusses the various types of reserve batteries used in military applications, their designs, and future prospects. Reserve batteries have a long storage life and high power capabilities, making them suitable for military purposes. The article covers the design of reserve batteries, including those using electrolyte movement and thermal batteries, and their applications in torpedoes, aircraft emergency power supplies, and mines. The increasing shelf-life of lithium primary batteries and the higher energy density of lithium reserve batteries are allowing them to replace aqueous electrolyte reserve batteries in some applications.
