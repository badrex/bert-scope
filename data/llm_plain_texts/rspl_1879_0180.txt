tldr: The author describes their successful experiments in creating a diamond-like carbon, which is as hard as natural diamond and does not affect polarized light. They also mention obtaining crystals with curved faces belonging to the octahedral form, a unique characteristic shared only with diamond. The specific gravity of the created diamond ranges as high as 3.5.
