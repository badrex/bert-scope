tldr: The author's study shows that in immobilized Xenopus embryos, sensory stimulation can trigger different motor responses, such as swimming and struggling. These distinct motor patterns can be evoked by various types of stimulation, like mechanical or electrical, and are controlled by Rohon-Beard sensory neurons. The results suggest that these neurons can both trigger swimming and 'gate in' struggling motor patterns, affecting behavioral selection according to their pattern of activity.
