tldr: The authors conducted flash photolysis experiments on ozone to study the transfer of vibrational energy and the behavior of excited oxygen molecules. They observed the rapid formation and decay of excited oxygen and investigated the effect of different inert gases on the process. The findings provide insights into the behavior of excited molecules in chemical reactions and contribute to the understanding of atmospheric chemistry.
