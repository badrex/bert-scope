tldr: The article discusses the use of neutron diffraction and inelastic scattering techniques to study the structure and dynamics of amphiphile and biological molecules in aqueous solutions. The contrast variation method is introduced, which allows for the variation of contrast between the scattering of the aqueous medium and the molecules in it. Examples of applications include amphiphile-water lamellar mesophases, diffraction from collagen, viruses, and polymer solutions. The information obtained from these techniques is complementary to that from nuclear magnetic resonance and electron spin resonance studies of diffusion.
