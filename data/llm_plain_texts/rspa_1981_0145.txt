tldr: The authors present a cohomological interpretation of the description of massive fields using twistor theory. They show that the cohomology group is naturally isomorphic to the space of positive-frequency free fields of mass and spin, provided certain conditions are met. This isomorphism is established by considering the properties of two-point fields on spacetime, which are of interest in their own right and have connections to the theory of twistor diagrams.
