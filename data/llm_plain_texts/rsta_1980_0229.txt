tldr: This article examines the energy budget in and out of coronal holes, regions of the solar surface where the magnetic field lines are open and the solar wind originates. The authors estimate the energy required to accelerate the solar wind in these regions and discuss various energy loss and gain mechanisms, such as thermal conduction, radiation loss, and enthalpy flux. They conclude that the energy requirements of coronal hole regions are substantially greater than those of other regions, with thermal plasma pressure being the main factor determining this conclusion.
