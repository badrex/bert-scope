tldr: This article presents analytical solutions for the crack tip region in hydraulic fracturing, focusing on fracture width and pressure when a power-law fluid drives a plane strain fracture in an impermeable linear elastic solid. The study finds an intermediate asymptotic solution with a singularity weaker than the inverse square root singularity of linear elastic fracture mechanics, and provides a useful approximation for the finite crack case.
