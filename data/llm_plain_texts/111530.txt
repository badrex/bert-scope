tldr: The author investigates the deflection of the plumb-line in India caused by the attraction of the Himalaya Mountains and the elevated regions beyond. They propose a hypothesis of a deficiency of matter below the mountain mass to explain the observed deflections. The author also discusses the impact of variations in the Earth's density on the plumb-line deflections and the importance of accurate verticals for geodetic operations.
