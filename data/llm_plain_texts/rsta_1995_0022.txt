tldr: The authors present a novel technique to reject outliers from an m-dimensional data set when the underlying model is a hyperplane. The method operates in the orthogonal regression framework, using a new regression diagnostic based on eigendecomposition. It subsumes the traditional residuals scheme and provides an error model for the solution once the contaminants have been removed.
