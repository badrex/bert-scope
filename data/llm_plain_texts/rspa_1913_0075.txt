tldr: The author, Prof. Sir James Dewar, investigates the atomic specific heats of various elements and compounds between the boiling points of liquid nitrogen and hydrogen. By using a liquid hydrogen calorimeter, he discovers that the mean atomic specific heats can be represented as a periodic function of the atomic weights. This research contributes to the understanding of the relationship between atomic structure and thermal properties.
