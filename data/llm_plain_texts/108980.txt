tldr: The author, A. Cayley, explores the mathematical concept of quantics, specifically focusing on binary quintics and their covariants. The article delves into the theory of determining the character of an equation of any order, providing a more general form of the theory and applying it to quartic and quintic equations. The author also discusses the Tschirnhausen transformation and the canonical form used in the investigation of equations.
