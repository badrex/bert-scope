tldr: The authors conducted experiments on sheep and chickens to study the role of the testicle in the formation of secondary sexual characters. They discovered that the testicle produces an internal secretion that is absorbed into the bloodstream, leading to metabolic changes that result in the development of male characteristics. This research helped to understand the function of the testicle beyond sperm production and shed light on the role of hormones in sexual differentiation.
