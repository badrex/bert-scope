tldr: The authors developed a method to measure the burning velocities of combustible gas-air mixtures near the limits of combustion using a flat disk-shaped flame. They applied this method to various fuels, including methane, propane, and n-heptane, and found that the burning velocities are mainly dependent on reaction heat. The flat-flame burner was also used to determine the limits of combustion, revealing that lower limits are lower when determined using this method compared to the standard tube method.
