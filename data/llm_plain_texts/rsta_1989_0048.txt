  - Shear Deformation
tldr: This study examines the micro- and macroscopic aspects of large-strain deformation through shear using physical and phenomenological models. The authors analyze the effects of strain hardening, latent hardening, strain-rate sensitivity, boundary constraints, and initial textures on texture evolution and constitutive response. They also compare the behavior predicted by phenomenological theories and a physically based polycrystal model, finding a close correspondence between the two.
