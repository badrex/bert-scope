tldr: This article explores the air wave surrounding an expanding sphere and its properties. The author finds that the air wave expands at a uniform rate, and the velocity and pressure at corresponding points remain constant throughout the expansion. The study also examines the boundary conditions and shock waves that may occur during the expansion process.
