tldr: The author investigates the flow of electric current in semi-infinite stratified media, developing a theory that allows for the determination of the underlying stratification from surface potential gradient measurements. This work has applications in geophysics, particularly in understanding the Earth's subsurface structure through electrical prospecting methods.
