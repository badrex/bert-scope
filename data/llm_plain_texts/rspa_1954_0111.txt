tldr: The authors conducted an experimental study on the friction and strength properties of crystalline materials like rock-salt, lead sulfide, and ice. They found that the specific shear strength of the material at the rubbing interface is nearly seven times greater than the bulk shear strength of a rock-salt single crystal. This is due to the high hydrostatic pressures in the contact area, which prevents brittle fracture and causes marked plastic deformation. The plastic yield stress of the materials correlates with their indentation hardness.
