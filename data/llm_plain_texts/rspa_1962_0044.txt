tldr: The authors investigate the stress recrystallization of graphite, a process that can yield graphite of high crystal perfection. They find that certain forms of pyrolytic graphite, when deposited from gaseous methane, incorporate large strain energy. By raising the temperature, recrystallization can occur under controlled or explosive conditions, leading to improved crystal quality. The process is explained through various experiments and measurements, including X-ray diffraction and electrical resistivity tests.
