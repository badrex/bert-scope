tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the distribution of micro-organisms in the air using Hesse's apparatus. They observed variations in the number of micro-organisms present in the air based on the season and location. The results showed an enormous increase in the number of micro-organisms in crowded rooms. The authors also estimated the number of organisms falling on a given horizontal surface using nutrient gelatine dishes.
