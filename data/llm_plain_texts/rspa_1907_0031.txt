tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments to determine the refractive indices of gaseous elements such as potassium, zinc, cadmium, mercury, arsenic, selenium, and tellurium. They used a refractometer and found that the gaseous refractivities of zinc, cadmium, and tellurium were higher than previously known values. The results confirmed previous observations of the periodicity of refractivity and its connection with atomic weight and valency.'
