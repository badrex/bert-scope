tldr: The author conducted a study on 1000 adult female prawns to determine the correlation between various parts of their hard exoskeleton. They found that the highest degree of correlation exists between paired organs, such as the right and left squames and the right and left exopodites of the 6th pair of swimmerets. The study also revealed differences in correlation between the telson and the segments of the abdomen, depending on their proximity.
