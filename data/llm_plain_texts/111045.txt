tldr: The author presents a new mathematical theory of magnetism that does not rely on the hypothesis of two magnetic fluids. Instead, it is based on facts and experimental researches by Coulomb. The theory agrees with Poisson's work and lays the foundation for further investigations on magnetic distributions and induction in various substances.
