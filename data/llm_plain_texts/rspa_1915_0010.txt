tldr: The authors describe their attempts to measure the viscosity of iodine vapour using a method similar to that used for bromine vapour. They found that liquid iodine was not sufficiently mobile, and its surface was too variable to allow accurate measurements. They also discuss the critical temperature of iodine and the viscosity of iodine vapour at that temperature.
