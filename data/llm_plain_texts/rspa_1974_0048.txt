tldr: This article investigates the unimolecular reactions of C6H8 isomers and their photolysis. The thermal isomerization of hexa-1, trans-3,6-triene is studied, and the Arrhenius parameters for the reactions are determined. The results are combined with thermochemical data to calculate the rates of the photochemical processes. The study confirms that the reactions involving vibrationally excited ground-state molecules formed by internal conversion are consistent with the observed photochemical reactions.
