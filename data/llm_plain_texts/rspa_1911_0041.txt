tldr: The author describes a method to make the paths of ionizing particles visible through a gas using a cloud chamber. The technique involves condensing water on ions set free by the particles, allowing the trails to be seen. The author demonstrates the method using alpha rays and X-rays, providing insights into the nature of ionization and particle detection.
