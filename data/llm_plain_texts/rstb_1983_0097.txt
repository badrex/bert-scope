tldr: The study examines the development of the anostracan Branchinecta ferox, focusing on how functional continuity is maintained from the nauplius stage to the adult. It describes the morphological specializations and the complex skeleto-muscular system, which are crucial for locomotion and feeding. The research also covers the development of other structures, such as the mouthparts, trunk limbs, and endoskeleton, as the organism grows.
