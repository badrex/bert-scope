tldr: 'This study investigates the changes in nucleic acid and protein content of bacterial cells during growth cycles under equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions. The results show that non-equilibrium states, such as using cells from 24-hour glucose-exhausted cultures, can lead to distorted cell properties. Continuous culture methods provide more accurate equilibrium values for cell properties. The study emphasizes the importance of understanding the economy of the cell and the factors affecting its growth and division.'
