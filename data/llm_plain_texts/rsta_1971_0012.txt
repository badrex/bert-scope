tldr: This article discusses the petrology of weathered and metamorphosed basalts from the ocean floor, specifically from Swallow Bank and Western Seamounts. The authors analyze the chemical and mineralogical changes that occur in these rocks, which are exposed to various alteration processes. The study provides insights into the nature of the alteration process and its effects on the physical properties of the rocks, contributing to the understanding of the geology of the ocean floor.
