tldr: The author, B. Higgins, discovered that a reaction between tin-foil and a copper nitrate salt in nitrous acid solution can produce fire and detonation. The salt, when dried and heated, ignites and burns, causing the tin-foil to explode. This phenomenon occurs due to the rapid deliquescence and heat generated by the reaction between the copper nitrate salt and tin-foil.
