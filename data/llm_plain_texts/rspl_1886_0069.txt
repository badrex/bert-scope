tldr: This study investigates the various movements produced by stimulating different regions of the cortical centre for the upper limb in monkeys. The authors, Beevor and Horsley, analyze the topographical anatomy of the limb centres as defined by Professor Ferrier. They discover that the regions for larger joint actions are located at the upper part of the area, while those for smaller and more differentiated movements are found at the lower part. The study also reveals that extension is a characteristic movement of the upper part of Ferrier's arm centre, while flexion is typical of the lower part. A small portion between these two regions exhibits a condition called 'confusion,' where both flexors and extensors contract simultaneously, resulting in a neutral joint position.
