tldr: This study examines the daily partitioning of pollinators in an African Acacia community. The research found that Acacia species differ in their timing of reward release, such as pollen and nectar, throughout the day. This daily division helps avoid competition for pollination among the Acacia species. The study also discovered that Acacia species offering different rewards, like nectar and pollen, attract different pollinator groups, promoting mutualistic relationships between the plants and their pollinators.
