tldr: This article describes Henry Kater's experiments to determine the precise length of a pendulum vibrating seconds in London's latitude. Kater used a unique method to find the center of oscillation and measured the length of a pendulum using a knife-edge suspension. The results were accurate and provided valuable insights into the relationship between pendulum length and latitude.
