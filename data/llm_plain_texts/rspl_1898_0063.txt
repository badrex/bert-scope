tldr: The author discusses the challenges of detecting and localizing phosphorus in animal and vegetable tissues. They examine various microchemical methods, including the use of pyrogallol and ammonium phospho-molybdate, and propose a new reducing reagent, phenylhydrazin hydrochloride, for more accurate detection. The author's findings have implications for understanding cellular processes and tissue analysis.
