tldr: The author investigates the electromagnetic fields created by variable electric charges and their impact on the intensities of spectrum lines in the context of quantum theory. They propose a method based on Maxwell's electromagnetic equations and their solutions, which can be used to calculate the electric and magnetic forces and the rate of energy loss due to radiation. The study focuses on Schrodinger distributions and confirms the validity of the method despite convergence difficulties.
