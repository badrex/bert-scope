tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments on marine algae photo-synthesis, focusing on the fixation of carbon and nitrogen from inorganic sources in sea water. They found that marine algae fix nitrogen from the dissolved nitrogen in the atmosphere and that the increase in alkalinity of sea water can be used as a measure of photo-synthesis activity. The study confirms that marine algae obtain their nitrogen from the dissolved nitrogen in the sea water, which comes from the nitrogen in the air.'
