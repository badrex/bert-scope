tldr: 'The authors determined the specific heat of sea water using an electrically heated calorimeter, finding accurate values over a range of temperatures and salinities. Their results showed that previous accepted values were significantly in error and that the temperature coefficient of specific heat for ocean water is different from that of pure water. This research is important for oceanographic calculations and understanding the thermodynamics of sea water.'
