tldr: This article describes the challenges of providing fresh water to military garrisons in Sheerness, Landguard-Fort, and Harwich during the 18th century. The author, Thomas Hyde Page, explains the unsuccessful attempts to obtain water on-site and proposes a solution for constructing wells that can withstand the filtration of saltwater. The article provides a detailed account of the well construction process in Fort Townshend, Sheerness, which involved the use of wooden frames to support the excavation and prevent the collapse of the well.
