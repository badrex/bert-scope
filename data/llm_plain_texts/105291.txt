tldr: A case study of a boy suffering from convulsive fits, which were cured after ingesting a mixture of white lead, lampblack, and linseed oil. The treatment resulted in the discharge of numerous small worms, leading to a significant improvement in the boy's health and cognitive abilities. The boy's family members also experienced infestations of worms, suggesting a possible connection between the condition and parasitic infection.
