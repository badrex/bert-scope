tldr: 'Sir Jagadis Chunder Bose developed a high magnification crescograph to study plant growth and movement. The crescograph allowed for a magnification of up to 10,000 times, enabling researchers to observe and record plant growth and its variations under different environmental conditions in a short period of time. This innovative device helped expand the understanding of plant growth and its responses to various stimuli.'
