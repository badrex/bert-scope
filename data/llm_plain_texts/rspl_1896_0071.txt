tldr: The author analyzes earthquake statistics from Japan to investigate possible lunar periodicities in earthquake frequency. They find evidence of lunar daily and half-daily periods, suggesting that tidal stresses acting directly on the earth's crust may be responsible. The study also highlights the importance of considering local seismic activity when searching for periodicities.
