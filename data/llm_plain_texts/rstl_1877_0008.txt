tldr: The author investigates the influence of geological changes on the Earth's axis of rotation and obliquity of the ecliptic. They discuss the precession and nutation of an ellipsoid of revolution and the changes in the position of the Earth's axis of symmetry due to deformations. The author concludes that geological changes can have a significant impact on the Earth's axis of rotation and the obliquity of the ecliptic, and that further research is needed to better understand the relationship between these factors.
