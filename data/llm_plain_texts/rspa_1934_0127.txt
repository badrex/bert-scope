revised_title: 'Polarization of Electrons and Material Strength'
semantic_tags:
  - Electron Polarization
  - Material Strength
  - Crystal Lattice Structure
  - Stray Scattering
  - Relativistic Wave Equation
tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the polarization of electrons and the relationship between grain orientation and fracture in materials. They found that a relationship exists between these factors and that further investigations on the mechanical properties of fibred materials may help in understanding the strength of solids.
