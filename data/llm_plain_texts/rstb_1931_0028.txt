tldr: This article investigates the metabolic products formed from glucose by various species of fungi, focusing on Helminthosporium and Clasterosporium. The main metabolic products include ethyl alcohol, mannitol, and smaller amounts of glycerol and acetaldehyde. The study provides insight into the biochemistry of microorganisms and their glucose metabolism.
