tldr: This study investigates the evolution of skeletal muscle excitation-contraction coupling and the appearance of dihydropyridine-sensitive intramembrane charge movement. Researchers found that the vertebrate type of E-C coupling was acquired between cephalochordates and agnathans, accompanied by the appearance of the DHP-sensitive component of intramembrane charge movement. The results suggest that there was an evolutionary step to acquire the depolarization-induced Ca2+ release mechanism in invertebrates.
