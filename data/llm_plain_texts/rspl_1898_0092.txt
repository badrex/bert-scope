tldr: In this article, Ramsay and Travers describe the preparation and some properties of pure argon, a previously unknown constituent of the atmosphere. They discuss the process of isolating argon from atmospheric air and its properties, such as density and atomic weight. The discovery of argon, along with other inert gases, expanded our understanding of the composition and behavior of gases in the atmosphere.
