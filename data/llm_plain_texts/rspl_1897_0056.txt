tldr: The authors conducted laboratory experiments to study the behavior of calcium's H and K lines in the solar spectrum. They discovered that under certain conditions, the intensity of other calcium lines, such as the strong blue line, is greatly reduced compared to H and K. This phenomenon helps explain the modifications of the calcium spectrum observed in solar and stellar phenomena.
