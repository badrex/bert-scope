tldr: This article discusses the anomalous dispersion of sodium vapour and the debate between Julius and Wood on the subject. Julius warns against attributing all dark bands in the absorption spectrum to absorption alone, while Wood believes there is a difference between their views on the disappearance of light between the D-lines. The article also highlights the importance of further investigating the connection between anomalous dispersion and solar phenomena.
