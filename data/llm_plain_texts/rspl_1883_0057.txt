tldr: The authors explore the shapes of drilled holes and the curves that circumscribe rotating polygons. They examine the factors that cause holes to deviate from a circular shape and propose the use of hypotrochoids to describe the possible shapes. The study has implications for drilling technology and the understanding of the geometry of rotating polygons.
