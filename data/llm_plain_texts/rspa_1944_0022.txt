tldr: The authors developed a method to accurately determine the spatial orientation of charged particle tracks in photographic emulsions, which they applied to study the scattering of 8.8 and 13 MeV neutrons by protons. The results showed that the scattering was isotropic in the center of mass system, with some evidence for a high-order periodic fluctuation in the angular distribution of scattered intensity. This research contributed to understanding the forces between neutrons and protons at close distances, which is crucial for the development of nuclear physics.
