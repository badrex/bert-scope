tldr: The article discusses the importance of creating nitrogen cycles in derelict land to establish sustainable ecosystems. It explains that derelict land has a low nitrogen content, which limits the growth of vegetation. The author suggests that nitrogen capital must be built up in the soil through the use of legumes and other methods to enable a self-sustaining ecosystem. The study focuses on the reclamation of china clay sand spoils, which are an extreme example of nitrogen-deficient material.
