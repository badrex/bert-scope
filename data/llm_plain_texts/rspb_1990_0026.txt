tldr: The study investigates the relationship between the supply of exogenous malate or succinate and the accumulation and utilization of poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) by nitrogen-fixing soybean root nodule bacteroids. The results show that during the supply of malate and succinate, bacteroids accumulate PHB, which is then used as an energy source for enhanced N2 fixation when exogenous substrates are not available.
