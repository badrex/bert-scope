tldr: This article clarifies the misunderstanding between the van der Waals force and energy level shifts in an atom near perfectly conducting plates. The authors show that the force calculated in their previous work is in agreement with Barton's work on energy level shifts. They also explain that the heuristic treatment of the Lamb shift, as used in Welton's procedure, fails to reproduce the effects due to the presence of the plates.
