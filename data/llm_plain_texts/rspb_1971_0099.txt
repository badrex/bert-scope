tldr: The article discusses the development of commercial processes for producing 6-aminopenicillanic acid (6-APA), a key raw material for the semi-synthetic penicillin industry. It covers the biosynthesis of 6-APA, microbial and chemical processes for its production, and the enzymatic hydrolysis of penicillins to obtain 6-APA. The article highlights the importance of efficient fermentation conditions and the role of enzymes in deacylation processes.
