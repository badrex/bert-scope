revised_title: Dynamics of Extended Bodies in General Relativity: Momentum and Angular Momentum
semantic_tags:
  - General Relativity
  - Gravitational Dynamics
  - Angular Momentum
  - Energy-Momentum Tensor
  - Electromagnetic Fields
tldr: This article proposes definitions for the total momentum vector and spin tensor of an extended body in arbitrary gravitational and electromagnetic fields. The author discusses the use of these definitions in defining the center of mass and presents a special case study of motion in a de Sitter universe. The article also introduces the concept of dynamical rigidity and its relation to the mass constant and the total rest energy of a body.
