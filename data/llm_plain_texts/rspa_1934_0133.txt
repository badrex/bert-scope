tldr: This study describes a method for producing monochromatic light to induce photochemical reactions in small amounts of material. The absorption spectra of biological molecules like carotene and vitamin A are measured at liquid air temperatures, revealing differences between the substances. The research also makes progress in separating different molecules in vitamin E concentrates.
