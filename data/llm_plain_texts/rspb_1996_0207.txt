tldr: The authors propose a mechanism to explain the unexpectedly high genetic variance in sexually selected traits, resolving the lek paradox. They argue that condition dependence of sexually selected traits and high genetic variance in condition lead to the capture of genetic variance into sexually selected traits. This explanation is supported by empirical evidence and has implications for the coevolution of female preference and male traits.
