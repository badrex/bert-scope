tldr: This article investigates the shape and stability of a charged drop levitated in a uniform electric field. The authors use asymptotic analysis and Galerkin finite element calculations to determine the equilibrium shapes and stability limits of the drops. The results provide insights into the operation of electrostatic levitators and have applications in containerless processing of ultra-pure materials and space-based processing of centimetre-sized drops.
