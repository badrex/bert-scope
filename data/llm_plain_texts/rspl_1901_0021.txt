tldr: The author examines the structure and affinities of fossil plants, specifically the seed-like fructification of Lepidocarpon, a genus of Lycopodiophyta from the Carboniferous formation. They conclude that while these structures share similarities with true seeds, they are too different from known Spermophyta to indicate any genetic connection between Lycopods and Gymnosperms or other Phanerogams.
