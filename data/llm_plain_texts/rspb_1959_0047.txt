tldr: The author examines theories of plant torsions and conducts experiments to test their validity. They investigate how factors like gravity, light, and auxin (indole-acetic acid) affect the growth and twisting of plant hypocotyls. The results show that Ambronn's quantitative theory cannot explain the directions of the torsions caused by the pair of factors gravity and auxin, and the natural geostrophic torsions. The author suggests that the mechanism of response in the auxin torsions and natural strophisms depends on forces set up by changes in the transverse growth, which is a modification of a previous suggestion by Rawitscher.
