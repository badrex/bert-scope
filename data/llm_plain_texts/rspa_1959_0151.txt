tldr: The gaseous oxidation of diethyl ether was studied in detail, focusing on the reaction mechanism and products. The reaction has characteristics similar to hydrocarbon oxidation, with excess oxygen retarding the rate of combustion. The main products during the induction period are acetaldehyde, peracetic acid, and ethanol. In the later stages, acetaldehyde and peracetic acid are consumed, with ethanol and acetic acid being the primary end-products. The study provides insights into the intermediate products and the influence of temperature, surface, and added products on the reaction.
