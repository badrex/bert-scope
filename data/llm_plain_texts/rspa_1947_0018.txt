tldr: The authors investigate the anisotropy of thermal expansion as a cause of deformation in metals and alloys. They find that the extent of deformation increases with the temperature range and that certain non-cubic metals, like cadmium and zinc, are deformed by heating and cooling. The study also shows that the behavior of metals during casting and annealing can be affected by anisotropic thermal expansion.
