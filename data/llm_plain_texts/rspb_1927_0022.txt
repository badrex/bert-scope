tldr: 'This study examines the development and morphology of the gonads in mice, focusing on the formation of the indifferent gonad and the differentiation into ovaries and testes. The research describes the process of gonad formation, including the role of the germinal epithelium and the vascular supply. The differentiation of the ovaries and testes is also discussed, highlighting the differences in their development. The presence of primordial germ-cells is noted, characterized by their large size and clear appearance.'
