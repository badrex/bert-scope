tldr: This article discusses the volcanic and magmatic evolution of Reunion Island, an oceanic shield volcano, and compares it with other oceanic shield volcanoes, particularly the Hawaiian volcanoes. The study focuses on the chemistry and stages of development of the island's volcanic structure, including the shield-forming stage and the declining stage, and provides insights into the complex history of magma generation and accumulation within the Earth's mantle.
