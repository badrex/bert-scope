tldr: This article discusses the formation of ethers by the interaction of primary alcohols and olefines at high pressure. The authors found that ethylene, propylene, and butylene can combine with aliphatic alcohols in the presence of a suitable catalyst and high pressure. They determined the equilibrium constants for the system alcohol-olefine-ether and provided a detailed analysis of the experimental procedure and results.
