tldr: 'The authors investigated the effect of peripheral retinal stimulation on the contrast sensitivity of the fovea. They found that peripheral stimulation with white light can reduce the contrast perception at the fovea. The study was extended to monochromatic lights, and the results showed that the reductions in contrast sensitivity were smaller in the red end of the spectrum compared to the blue end. The effects may be partly due to reflex actions associated with the retinal rods.'
