tldr: The author, Edw. Lhwyd, shares his findings of various fossilized sea stars and other marine life during his travels. He discusses the relationship between these fossils and sea stars, comparing them to the connection between fossil shells and living marine shells. Lhwyd also mentions his correspondence with Mr. Pezron, who believes that Greek, Roman, and Celtic languages have a common origin. Lhwyd is still exploring this idea and has not yet determined if the Celtic language is the mother tongue.
