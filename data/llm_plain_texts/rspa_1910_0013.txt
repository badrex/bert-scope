tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the conduction of heat through rarefied gases. They found that the heat-conducting ability of gases varies directly with pressure at low pressures. The results showed that gases like methane, acetylene, and cyanogen were better conductors than hydrogen, while helium was only slightly better than carbon dioxide. The study also revealed that the best conductor at low pressures was not necessarily the best conductor at higher pressures.
