tldr: This article explores the role of abscisic acid (ABA) and farnesol in helping plants cope with water stress. ABA, a sesquiterpenoid, plays a significant part in the second line of defense against water stress. Farnesol, another sesquiterpenoid, is suggested to alter the permeability of chloroplast envelope membranes, allowing the release of ABA into the cytoplasm. The closure of stomata induced by ABA is part of a series of integrated responses that help maintain turgor and growth when water is scarce.
