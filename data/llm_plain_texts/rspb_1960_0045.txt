tldr: The author investigates the role of the host in the development of nematode parasites, specifically the processes of infective larvae exsheathing and eggs hatching. The study shows that a stimulus from the host, dependent on the concentration of undissociated carbonic acid, pH, and Eh, is required to initiate development in the parasites. The host's role in restarting development may be an adaptation to parasitism.
