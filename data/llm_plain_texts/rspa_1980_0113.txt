tldr: The authors present a comprehensive theory of surface fluctuations in simple fluids, including contributions from capillary waves and density fluctuations. They consider a fluid with non-zero surface tension, viscosities, compressibility, and thermal conductivity and find that thermal conductivity has a small effect on the power spectrum, while compressibility leads to additional continua in the surface spectrum. Numerical results for liquid argon and mercury are provided.
