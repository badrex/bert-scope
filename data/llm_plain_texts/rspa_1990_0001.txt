tldr: The authors study the stress-driven redistribution of point defects near crack-like singularities in materials. They analyze the elastic interaction between a crack and a point defect, and estimate the kinetics of point defect redistribution under mode II load and a slip band impinging against a grain boundary sink. The study provides insights into the importance of stress-driven processes in the fracture of materials.
