tldr: The author, J. P. Gassiot, conducted experiments to measure the pressure of vapor in a vacuum using a mercurial siphon-gauge. He found that the electrical discharge's condition was affected by the vacuum's imperfection, as demonstrated by the changes in the form of the strie while heating potash in a carbonic acid vacuum-tube. The results showed that even a trace of air remaining in the siphon-gauge could impact the electrical discharge's appearance.
