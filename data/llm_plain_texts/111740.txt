tldr: The author discusses the observations and conclusions derived from the study of magnetic declination at the Observatory of St. Helena. They analyze the secular change in the earth's magnetic force and its impact on the horizontal direction of a magnet at the location. The study covers a period of 236 years, from 1610 to 1846, and provides insights into the magnitude and uniformity of the changes in the earth's magnetic force.
