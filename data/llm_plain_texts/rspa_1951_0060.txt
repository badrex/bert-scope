tldr: The article discusses the photodisintegration of the alpha-particle and its inverse processes. The authors calculate the partial cross-sections for photodisintegration using first-order perturbation theory and find that the yield of gamma-rays from the reaction increases with bombarding energy. They also investigate the radiative capture of thermal neutrons by helium-4 and the gamma-ray yield of the reaction, concluding that the radiative cross-section for the reaction should be smaller than that for the photodisintegration reaction at corresponding energies by a factor of about 10.
