tldr: This article discusses the progress made in understanding ocean currents and their dynamics through two-dimensional wind-driven models and more recent three-dimensional numerical models. The author reviews the successes and limitations of these models, highlighting the importance of accounting for nonlinear effects and vertical structure in explaining features of the ocean's mean circulation, such as the equatorial undercurrent.
