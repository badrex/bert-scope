tldr: The authors examine channel convection in partly solidified systems, focusing on the development of solute-rich channels in metallic alloys. They explore the role of thermosolutal convection, which arises from buoyancy forces caused by solute segregation in the partly solidified mushy region of a casting. The study covers a range of materials, including metallic, aqueous, and organic systems, and discusses the implications of their findings for understanding and improving casting processes.
