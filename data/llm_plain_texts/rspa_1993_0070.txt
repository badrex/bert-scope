tldr: The authors develop new results about continuous spectrum eigenfunction expansions and apply them to solve the Cauchy problem for ordinary and partial differential equations. They use a kernel function and a general expansion technique to obtain a solution that depends continuously on the initial conditions and converges to the expected solution as time progresses. This approach provides a natural solution to the Cauchy problem even when the initial condition is a distribution with compact support.
