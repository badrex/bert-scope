tldr: The authors compare and analyze different methods for measuring light absorption, including photographic, photoelectric, and spectrographic methods. They discuss the advantages and limitations of each method and conclude that the photoelectric method is superior for detecting differences and small changes in light absorption. The authors also highlight the importance of understanding the accuracy and reproducibility of the methods in obtaining reliable results.
