tldr: This study investigates the free tidal oscillations in rotating flat basins, specifically rectangles and sectors of circles. The authors develop a general theory to understand the dynamics of tides in these simple basins, which can help interpret tidal studies in more complex real-world oceans. They find that as the speed of rotation increases, a Kelvin regime sets in, where the tide concentrates near the periphery of the basin, decreasing exponentially towards the interior.
