tldr: The author examines the structure of a diamond and discovers that its flat surface is covered in minute bands, which are the edges of veins or layers with different reflective and refractive powers. This unique structure explains the imperfections in the diamond's performance as a microscope and its ability to produce multiple images. The author also discusses the implications of this structure on the optical properties of the diamond and its relationship to other minerals.
