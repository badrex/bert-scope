tldr: The author describes a unique aurora borealis event observed on October 8, 1726, in which luminous streams appeared in the sky without a connected arch or cloud. The streams had a horizontal motion and covered the whole hemisphere with a variety of colors, mainly deep red. The author speculates that the phenomenon may have been caused by a thin, sulfurous cloud over the Earth's atmosphere.
