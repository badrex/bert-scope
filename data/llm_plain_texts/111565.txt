tldr: The author, A.W. Hofmann, conducted research on the reaction between dibromide of ethylene and triethylphosphine, resulting in the formation of a new bromide compound. This compound, a diphosphonium bromide, is stable and has unique properties, such as not undergoing any change even when heated to 2500°C. The author also discusses the theoretical interest in the formation of this compound and its potential applications in the field of chemistry.
