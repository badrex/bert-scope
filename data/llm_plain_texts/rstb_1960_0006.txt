tldr: This study investigates three Late Pleistocene deposits on the English Channel coast, analyzing pollen, macroscopic plant remains, and molluscs to reconstruct vegetational, faunal, environmental, and climatic conditions. The deposits are found to be of Ipswichian (Eemian) Interglacial age, with significant changes in land and sea levels, and climatic conditions. The findings provide insights into the history of the English Channel during the interglacial period.
