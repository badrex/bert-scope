revised_title: Coal-Dust and Colliery Explosions: The Influence of Coal-Dust in Air and Fire-Damp
semantic_tags:
  - Coal mining safety
  - Gas explosions
  - Coal-dust behavior
  - Mine ventilation
  - Inflammability
tldr: This article investigates the role of coal-dust in colliery explosions and its influence on air and fire-damp. The author explains how coal-dust, combined with air and fire-damp, can become inflammable and cause explosions in dry coal mines. The author also discusses the importance of mine ventilation and the impact of temperature on the wetness or dryness of coal mines.
