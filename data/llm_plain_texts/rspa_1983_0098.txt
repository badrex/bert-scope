tldr: The article presents the maximum strength and stiffness design of tension/compression and flexural members considering the influence of their self-weight and external forces. The author provides analytical solutions and solutions derived by successive approximation for various cases. The paper also discusses the maximum stiffness design of flexural members with self-weight taken into account, formulating the variational problem and solving the necessary optimality conditions.
