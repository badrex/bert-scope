tldr: The author investigates the 'instantaneous' elasticity of active muscle by examining the thermal changes that occur when tension is rapidly lowered. They discovered that the contractile filaments in active muscle are highly inextensible and have properties opposite to those of bodies with long-range rubber-like elasticity. This finding challenges the idea that active muscle has long-range elastic properties similar to rubber.
