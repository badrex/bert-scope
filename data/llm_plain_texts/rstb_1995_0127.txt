tldr: This study assesses the efficacy of different badger control policies to combat bovine tuberculosis in southwest England. Culling-based strategies and a yet-to-be-developed oral vaccine were compared. The study found that repeated vaccination could potentially eradicate endemic disease, while culling-based strategies like gassing and clean ring were more effective than other methods. However, proactive strategies and repeated vaccination in areas with a history of bovine tuberculosis in badgers are needed for long-term control.
