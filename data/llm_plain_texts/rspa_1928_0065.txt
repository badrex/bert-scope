tldr: The authors conducted an experiment to study the behavior of a single crystal of iron subjected to alternating torsional stresses. They observed that the crystal exhibited slip bands and fatigue cracks, with four distinct zones where no slip bands were detected. The findings provide insights into the mechanism of deformation and failure of metals under torsional stress.
