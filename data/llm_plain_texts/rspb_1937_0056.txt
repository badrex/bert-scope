tldr: The authors conducted experiments with various hydrocarbons to study their carcinogenic activity. They found that certain compounds, such as methylcholanthrene and 3:4-benzpyrene, have a high order of carcinogenic activity. The study also explores the relationship between molecular structure and carcinogenic activity among compounds related to 1:2-benzanthracene.
