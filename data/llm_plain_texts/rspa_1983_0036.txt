tldr: The authors study the effective thermal conductivity of a composite material made of spherical particles embedded in a homogeneous matrix. They use a modified method by Zuzovski and Brenner to calculate the effective conductivity for simple, body-centered, and face-centered cubic arrays. The results show that these values can be used to estimate the effective conductivity for random arrays of identical spheres.
