tldr: In this article, Captain Rochfort Maguire and the officers of H.M.S. 'Plover' conducted hourly observations of magnetic declination in Point Barrow, on the shores of the Polar Sea, from 1852 to 1854. They discovered that the aurora was connected with the movements of the magnet, and that the brighter the aurora, the quicker the magnetic changes occurred. The observations showed that easterly disturbances preponderated, slightly increasing the easterly declination. The findings provide valuable contributions to our knowledge of magnetic variations of short periods.
