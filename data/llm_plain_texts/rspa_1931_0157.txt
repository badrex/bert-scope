tldr: This article discusses the photoelectric effect for X-rays using Dirac's relativistic theory. The author applies the theory of the Dirac electron to hydrogen-like atoms and calculates the total number of electrons emitted and their resultant forward momentum. The results are in qualitative agreement with experimental results for heavy atoms, excluding the variation with atomic number.
