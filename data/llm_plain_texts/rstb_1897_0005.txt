tldr: The author investigates the segmental representation of movements in the lumbar region of the mammalian spinal cord by exciting either the root or directly stimulating the spinal cord segments. The study focuses on understanding the relationship between the representation of one movement and another, and the localization of movements in the spinal cord. The results show that the postero-external column is the most excitable area on the spinal cord surface, and the method of direct excitation provides precise and accurate results.
