tldr: 'In this article, John Locke describes a year-long weather register he kept in Oates, Essex in 1692. He explains the instruments and methods used to record daily weather conditions, including temperature, wind direction, and precipitation. Locke suggests that if similar registers were kept across England, valuable insights into weather patterns, air quality, and health could be gained, potentially benefiting society.'
