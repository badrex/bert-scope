tldr: The author presents a new theory of magnetism based on experimental researches using the induction balance. They found that magnetization is due to a particular arrangement of molecules with magnetic properties, and mechanical or other actions can disturb this equilibrium, giving rise to magnetism. The author also discusses the influence of stress, torsion, and other factors on the magnetic properties of materials.
