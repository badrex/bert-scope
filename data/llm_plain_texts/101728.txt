tldr: Signor Cassini's observations and predictions of Jupiter's satellites challenged the hypotheses of Galileo Galilei. He discovered that the configurations of the satellites are crucial for verifying their hypotheses and found that the satellites' orbits are not always parallel to the ecliptic. Cassini's system accurately predicted the eclipses of the satellites, proving its superiority over Galilei's hypotheses.
