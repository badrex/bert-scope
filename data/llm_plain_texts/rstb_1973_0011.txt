tldr: The article discusses the role of Na-Ca exchange across the cell membrane in regulating vascular smooth muscle tone. The authors found that replacing external sodium with choline chloride or sucrose increased tension in rabbit aortic strips and pulmonary arteries. They suggest that a membrane transport mechanism, involving competition between sodium and calcium ions, may play a significant role in tension development and vascular tone regulation.
