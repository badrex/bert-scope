tldr: Dr. Maskelyne's formulas for finding the longitude and latitude of celestial objects from their right ascension and declination, and for finding their right ascension and declination from their longitude and latitude, have been demonstrated by Abram Robertson. These formulas have been appreciated for their conciseness and precision, especially by M. Delambre, who compares them favorably to the formulas given by Lalande.
