tldr: The author investigates the changes in the diameter of erythrocytes during hemolysis caused by various substances, such as hypotonic saline, saponin, sodium taurocholate, and a complement-ambocceptor system. They observe that the red blood cells behave as ellipsoids under internal pressure and can withstand a certain amount of distension before the capsule gives way. The study provides insights into the mode of action of hemolytic substances and their effects on the red blood cells.
