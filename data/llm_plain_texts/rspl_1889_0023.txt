tldr: The author conducted experiments to investigate the electro-chemical effects between the north and south polar terminals of magnetised steel bars when immersed in electrolytes. They found that the north terminal of the magnet tended to become electro-positive to the south terminal under certain conditions. This research aimed to understand the relationship between magnetism and electro-chemistry in iron.
