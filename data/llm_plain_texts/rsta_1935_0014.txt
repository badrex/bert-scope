tldr: The authors discuss the standardization of photo-electric cells for measuring visible light, focusing on the importance of accurate and reproducible standards. They describe their methods for comparing different types of cells and discuss the challenges of measuring light in various environments, such as under water and in different regions of the globe. The authors emphasize the need for precise measurements to differentiate light from total energy and the advantages of photo-electric methods for this type of work.
