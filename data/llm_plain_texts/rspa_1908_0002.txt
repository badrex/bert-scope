tldr: The author presents a method for depositing copper onto glass surfaces using an aqueous solution of phenylhydrazine, which results in a thin, brilliantly reflecting film. This process can be used to produce copper mirrors with improved properties, such as a pleasing red color and high reflectivity. The method involves heating a mixture of phenylhydrazine, cupric hydroxide, and potassium hydroxide, and then applying the resulting solution to a clean glass surface. The copper film can be further protected from oxidation by washing and applying a varnish coating.
