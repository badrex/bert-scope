tldr: This article discusses the debate between Arthur Everest and Prof. Frederick Keeble and other researchers on the production of anthocyanins and anthocyanidins. Everest's experiments showed that red pigments obtained from the reduction of flavonol derivatives were identical to natural anthocyanins in plants. However, Prof. Willstatter disagreed, claiming that these pigments were different from natural anthocyans. The author presents evidence supporting their conclusion that the red pigments are indeed true anthocyanins and anthocyanidins.
