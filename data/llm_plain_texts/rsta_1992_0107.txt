tldr: The article presents a new method for modeling processes within solids and at their surfaces using ab initio cluster calculations. The method is based on local density functional theory and is suitable for molecular solids, covalently bonded materials, and ionic systems. It involves the use of pseudopotentials to eliminate the need for core electrons and can efficiently determine the structure, vibrational, and electronic properties of clusters with up to 150 atoms. The author discusses the strengths and weaknesses of the method and applies it to the interstitial carbon-oxygen complex in silicon, finding good agreement with experimental results.
