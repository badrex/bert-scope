tldr: The authors conducted experiments to analyze the flow of water around an elliptic cylinder moving through a viscous fluid. They used a research water tank and a stream function to study the motion of particles in the fluid, comparing the experimental results with the Navier-Stokes equations. This research provided insights into the behavior of fluids around elliptical shapes and helped validate theoretical models.
