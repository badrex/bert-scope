  - Surface Waves
  - Bessel Functions
tldr: The authors study the behavior of waves traveling on the core of a swirling liquid. They develop a theory for the oscillations of a core formed in a tube of uniform diameter and analyze the effects of surface tension and centrifugal forces. The research also explains the formation of helical shapes in tornadoes and other swirling fluid phenomena.
