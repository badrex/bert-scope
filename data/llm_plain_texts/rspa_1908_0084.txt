tldr: The authors describe the process of creating transparent silver and gold films by heating thin metallic leaves to a specific temperature. They explain the change in properties, such as reflection and electric resistivity, and discuss the influence of surrounding atmospheres on the transparency of the films. The experiments show that transparent silver can be achieved at a lower temperature than transparent gold.
