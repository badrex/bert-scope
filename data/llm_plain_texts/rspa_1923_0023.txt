tldr: 'This study investigates the distortion and breakage of aluminum crystals during tensile tests. The authors found that the ratio of extension is proportional to the distortion, and the crystal's uniformity is affected by the point of breakage. This research contributes to understanding the mechanical properties of aluminum alloys.'
