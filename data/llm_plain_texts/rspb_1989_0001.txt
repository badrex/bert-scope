tldr: The study found that noradrenaline, a catecholamine present in animal and human blood, accelerates the atherogenic uptake of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) by arterial walls in anaesthetized rabbits. This increased uptake may contribute to the accelerated atherosclerosis and higher incidence of its clinical manifestations in conditions associated with elevated blood noradrenaline concentrations, such as stress, cigarette smoking, and phaeochromocytoma.
