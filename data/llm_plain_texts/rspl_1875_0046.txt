revised_title: 'The Dissociation of Calcium and the Line Spectra of Elementary Bodies'
semantic_tags:
  - Spectroscopy
  - Atomic physics
  - Calcium dissociation
  - Electric dissociation
  - Line spectra
tldr: The author, J. N. Lockyer, provides evidence that the molecular grouping of calcium in the sun is nearly broken up, leading to a better understanding of the electric dissociating conditions in the sun. He also discusses the line spectra of elementary bodies and their behavior under different conditions.
