tldr: The article discusses the observations of micrometeoroid flux from the Prospero and Ariel 4 satellites. The authors found a higher micrometeoroid flux near Earth's space, with evidence of particle clusters. The Prospero micrometeoroid detector, which has a lower mass threshold than other detectors, allowed for measurements in the region where solar radiation pressure effects become significant. The results provide insights into the micrometeoroid distribution and the potential impact on spacecraft and satellites.
