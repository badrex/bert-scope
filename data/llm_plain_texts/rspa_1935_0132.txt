tldr: The author discusses the theory of the anomalous specific heats of crystals, focusing on the contribution of molecular rotations. They analyze the partition functions of solids and the success of previous theories in explaining observed facts. The author also highlights the importance of considering the anharmonic nature of oscillations at higher temperatures and the effect of molecular rotations on specific heat curves.
