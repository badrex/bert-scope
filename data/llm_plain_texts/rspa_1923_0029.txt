tldr: The author critiques Loeb's experiments on the potential difference in Donnan Equilibrium and colloidal behavior of proteins in solution. They argue that the agreement between the observed and calculated potential difference does not support the theory of Donnan Equilibrium, as it is a necessary consequence of any mechanism that respects the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The author suggests that the potential difference is solely due to the contact of dissimilar solutions across a boundary, and that the system is in equilibrium.
