tldr: The gas-phase oxidation of neopentane was studied, revealing a self-consistent mechanism of degenerately branched chain reactions. The main products were explained by a scheme based on pivalaldehyde, which is independent of ad hoc surface reactions and assumptions about the neopentylperoxy radical. This mechanism provides a better understanding of the oxidation process and the intermediate reactions involved.
