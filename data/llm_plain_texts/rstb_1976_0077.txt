tldr: This article explores the early history and evolution of rice cultivation, tracing its origins to the area between north India and the Pacific coast, where hunting, fishing, and food-gathering inhabitants began cultivating rice in low-lying fields. The development of land preparation, transplanting, and irrigation techniques in the Yellow-Han River basins led to the expansion of rice culture and the creation of specialized rice types. The article also discusses the influence of human migration, selection, and environmental factors on the evolution of rice cultivation and its impact on the development of agriculture and human societies.
