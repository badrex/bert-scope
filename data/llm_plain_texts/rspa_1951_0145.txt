tldr: The authors conducted infra-red spectroscopic studies on globular protein structure, focusing on denaturation phenomena. They found that changes in chain configuration from folded to extended forms can be observed through frequency shifts of N-H and C=O absorption bands. This transformation is common in globular proteins and can be used to study denaturation processes.
