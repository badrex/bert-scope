tldr: This article explores the factors that influence the establishment of alien species in new habitats. It discusses the demographic attributes of successful and unsuccessful invaders and how different trophic levels, such as herbivores, carnivores, and plants, affect the likelihood of invasion. The study highlights the importance of competition, natural enemies, mutualists, and refuges in the probability of establishment for invading species.
