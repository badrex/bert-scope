tldr: The authors used numerical methods to simulate oscillatory ignition in hydrogen oxidation under conditions resembling the second ignition limit for equimolar hydrogen and oxygen mixtures in a well-stirred reactor. They simplified the kinetic scheme to a minimum of seven elementary steps and analyzed the role of each reaction in isothermal chain-branching oscillations under flowing conditions. The study provides a quantitative link between experimental measurements and simplified isothermal kinetic models, revealing essential kinetic features for the existence of isothermal oscillatory phenomena.
