semantic_tags:
  - Chemical equilibrium
  - Solubility
  - Thermodynamics
  - Equilibrium constants
  - Latent heat
tldr: The authors present a method for calculating solubilities and equilibrium constants of chemical reactions, as well as a formula for the latent heats of vaporization. They demonstrate the effectiveness of their method using examples of potassium bromide and other substances, and discuss the potential for applying this method to other cases.
