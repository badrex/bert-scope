tldr: The article describes two one-step isolation techniques for nuclear membranes using high concentrations of divalent ions or an alkaline pH. The methods allow for the separation and characterization of nuclear membranes, which play a crucial role in protecting the cell's genetic material and regulating the transport of molecules in and out of the nucleus. The techniques can be applied to various cell types, providing insights into the structure and function of nuclear membranes.
