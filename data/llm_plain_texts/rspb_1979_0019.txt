tldr: This article explores the interactions and adaptations of intracellular Protista within their host cells. Protista can be found in various host cells, including algae, ciliates, dinoflagellates, and other organisms. They can inhabit different compartments within the host cell, such as the nucleus, vacuoles, or the cytoplasm. Intracellular Protista can have mutualistic or parasitic relationships with their hosts, and they have developed various strategies to avoid destruction by the host's lysosomal system and to compete for nutrients.
