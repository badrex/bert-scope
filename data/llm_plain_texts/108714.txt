tldr: This article by Macquorn Rankine discusses the thermodynamic theory of steam-engines and its application to practical steamship engineering. It provides examples of steamships and analyzes their efficiency in terms of heat and work, as well as the efficiency of their engines and boilers. The author also examines the efficiency of the furnace and boiler, comparing it to the total heat of combustion of coal.
