tldr: This article presents a theoretical study of the magnetic properties of covalent XY6 complexes, focusing on the application of crystal field theory and the effects of spin-orbit coupling. The authors discuss the self-consistent field model, Coulomb interactions, Jahn-Teller effect, and spin-orbit coupling in the context of octahedral complexes containing transition elements. The study aims to provide a general framework for understanding the magnetic behavior of these complexes.
