  - Rotational Motion
tldr: The author presents a mathematical analysis of fluid motion with both rotational and irrotational components. They use Clebsch's forms to express the components of velocity and derive equations for pressure and potential, ultimately providing a method to determine the continuity of fluid motion in various scenarios.
