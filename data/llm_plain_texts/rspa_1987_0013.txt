tldr: This article investigates the domino effect, where regularly spaced elements in a periodic array topple one after another due to collisions. The author explores the necessary conditions for initiation and the speed of propagation of this wave in an array of identical elements that collide with their neighbors during unstable collapse. The study focuses on the intrinsic speed of wave propagation, which depends on geometric parameters and the coefficient of restitution, with friction playing a secondary role.
