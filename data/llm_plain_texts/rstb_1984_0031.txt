tldr: This article discusses the genetics of wheat storage proteins and their potential for manipulation by plant breeding to improve breadmaking quality. The authors describe the location of genes for endosperm storage proteins on various chromosomes and the importance of understanding protein quality for breadmaking. They also highlight the process of developing near-isogenic lines and screening landraces for novel proteins to improve wheat varieties.
