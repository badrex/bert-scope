tldr: This issue of the Proceedings of the Royal Society of London (Series A) features research on various topics, including acoustic experiments, viscosity coefficients, molecular energies, and catalysis. Notable articles discuss acoustic streaming in liquids, the dynamic lateral instability of beams, and the fine structure of the line 4686 A of singly ionized helium. These studies contribute to a deeper understanding of physical sciences and their applications.
