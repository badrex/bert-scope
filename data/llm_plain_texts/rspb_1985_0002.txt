tldr: The article describes the transient inward current (Tin) elicited by hyperpolarization during serotonin, glutamate, or muscarinic receptor activation in Xenopus oocytes. The Tin current is mainly due to chloride ion efflux and is presumably activated by calcium ion influx. The current is blocked by removing calcium from the bathing medium, adding manganese, cobalt, or lanthanum, or by intracellular injection of EGTA. The Tin current may play a role in regulating the excitability of neurons in the central nervous system.
