tldr: The author, William Marcet, describes a new method to extract the immediate chemical constituents of human and animal excrements. He identifies and discusses three main substances found in healthy excrements: excretine, margaric acid, and excretolic acid. The study provides insights into the chemical composition of excrements and their role in human and animal physiology.
