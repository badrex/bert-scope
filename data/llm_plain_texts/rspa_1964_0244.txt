tldr: The authors used the time-dependent Hartree method to study the interaction between molecules and quantized radiation in molecular crystals. They derived equations that connect the polarization of one molecule with the external field and the polarization of other molecules, leading to a better understanding of the refractive index and optical excitation waves in these crystals.
