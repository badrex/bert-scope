tldr: The author investigates the distribution and properties of histohematin and myohematin pigments in various animals using spectroscopy and microscopy techniques. They discover that these pigments are widespread in the animal kingdom and have a close relationship with other color pigments and haemoglobin. The study provides insights into the physiological importance of these pigments and their potential role in metabolism.
