tldr: This study investigates the duration of the recovery period after strenuous muscular exercise by observing respiratory metabolism. The authors establish a method to determine when carbon dioxide output and oxygen intake return to normal levels, and find that recovery is complete in less than 1 hour after 30 seconds of intense exercise for the subjects studied. The research also presents a modified Douglas bag technique for measuring respiratory changes during exercise and recovery.
