tldr: 'The authors studied the chloride-stimulated ATPase activity in the saltmarsh plant Limonium vulgare, which plays a role in salt secretion. They discovered a unique salt-inducible ATPase that is responsible for pumping chloride ions out of gland cells. The researchers also developed a method to purify this enzyme using affinity chromatography. This discovery provides insights into the complex process of anion transport and salt secretion in plants.'
