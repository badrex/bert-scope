tldr: The study investigates the alcoholic fermentation of glucose by Moniliformis dubius, a parasitic worm, in vitro. The worms utilize about 96% of the glucose, with ethanol and lactate as the primary end products of fermentation. The findings contribute to understanding carbohydrate metabolism in intestinal parasites and their relationship with the host.
