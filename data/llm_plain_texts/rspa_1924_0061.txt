tldr: The authors conducted spectroscopic experiments on silicon oxide and chloride band-spectra. They discovered that the new band-system is attributable to a chloride of silicon, and the oxide band-heads were correlated, suggesting an oxide origin. The study also analyzed the spectra of other chlorides, such as aluminum, boron, and carbon, which had not been previously recorded.
