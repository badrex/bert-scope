tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of previous magnetic history on the magnetisation of iron and steel samples. They discovered that the energy required to perform a complete cycle of magnetisation depends on the previous history of the material. The results showed that iron requires more energy when in a state following the application of a larger force to produce previous history. The authors also observed that the effects attributed to magnetic viscosity are more pronounced in solid specimens than in laminated ones.
