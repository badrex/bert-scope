semantic_tags:
  - Wave theory
  - Wave matrices
  - Wave equation
  - Linear transformations
  - Group properties
tldr: The author explores wave matrices and their properties, focusing on the wave equation and linear transformations. They introduce a new definition of wave matrices and discuss the group properties of wave sets, which can be developed into closed groups and classified. This work expands on previous theories and provides a more general understanding of wave matrices and their applications.
