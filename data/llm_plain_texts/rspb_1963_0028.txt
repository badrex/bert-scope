tldr: The author discovered a pulsating intraganglionar body (IG body) in the cardiac ganglion of octopods that contracts rhythmically with the same frequency as the organs of blood circulation. The IG body is composed of connective tissue, muscle fibers, blood vessels, and nerve elements. Its function remains enigmatic, but it may have neurosecretory properties and could be involved in releasing products of secretion from nerve terminations or squeezing them out of the ganglion.
