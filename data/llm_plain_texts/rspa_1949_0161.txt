  - Boundary layer
  - Colloidal solutions
tldr: The article presents a mathematical model for the sedimentation and diffusion of small particles in fluids. It considers various boundary conditions, such as a liquid with a free surface, and provides solutions for different scenarios. The model helps understand the behavior of particles in suspension and their interaction with the surrounding fluid.
