tldr: The authors studied the adsorption behavior of intermediate states involved in the anodic evolution reaction at platinum electrodes using potential-relaxation transients. They found two distinct types of adsorption behavior for potentials above and below 1.85 volts against the reversible electrode, which are related to the observed kinetics of the reaction. This research provides insights into the electrochemical evaluation of adsorption behavior in anodic O2 evolution reactions, which is essential for understanding and improving electrocatalytic processes.
