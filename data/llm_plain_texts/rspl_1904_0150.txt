tldr: The authors compared the accuracy of platinum and hydrogen thermometers at low temperatures using gas thermometers and platinum resistance thermometers. They found that the difference between the two temperature scales can be calculated using Callendar's formula, and that the maximum error in their measurements was less than 0.1Â°C. This research helped improve the understanding of temperature scales and their applications in scientific experiments.
