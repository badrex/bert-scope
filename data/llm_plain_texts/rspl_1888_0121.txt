tldr: This article investigates the principles of training rivers through tidal estuaries, focusing on the improvement of navigation channels in the Seine Estuary. The author discusses various factors affecting the training of rivers, such as estuary form, tidal capacity, fresh-water discharge, and silt accumulation. The author also presents a method of investigation to determine the effects of training works in any estuary, using the Seine Estuary as a case study.
