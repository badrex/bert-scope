tldr: The article introduces a contravariant theory of derivative strings, which generalizes scalar derivatives, tensors, and affine connections. The concept of derivative strings has applications in statistical inference and can be used to define covariant differentiation of elements of strings. The article also discusses various operations on strings, such as simple multiplication, convolutive multiplication, and index contractions.
