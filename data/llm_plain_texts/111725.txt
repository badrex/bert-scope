tldr: The author conducted experiments on land snails to study their growth patterns. They observed that the shells of Helicidae species grow slowly at first, then rapidly when the snails bury themselves in the ground. Different species have different methods of increasing their shell size, such as burying their heads or using decaying wood. The author also noted that snails form an operculum at the shell's aperture and retreat inside during winter.
