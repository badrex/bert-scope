tldr: This article examines the rheological properties of the 1971 Mount Etna lavas, focusing on the flow behavior and viscosity of the lava. The authors found that the lava underwent a rapid transition from Newtonian to non-Newtonian fluids near their source and that the Newtonian regime may be coincidental with a high mechanical energy/low heat energy regime. The lava's viscosity was calculated using various measurements, and the results were applied to analyze the flow phenomena observed during the eruption.
