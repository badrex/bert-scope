tldr: This article discusses the high-temperature properties of silicate liquids and their applications to the equilibration and ascent of basic magma. The authors conducted heat content measurements on various silicate liquids and used this data to derive a consistent set of volume, enthalpy, and entropy data for liquid silicate compounds. They also calculated the equilibration pressures and temperatures of lavas with a herzolitic source material and explored the ascent of basaltic magma through the Earth's mantle and lower crust.
