revised_title: 'Unified Approach to Describing Interaction Boundaries in Migrating Systems'
semantic_tags:
  - Migration patterns
  - Chemical interactions
  - Physical interactions
  - Constituent velocities
  - Boundary forms
tldr: The authors present a unified and simplified approach to describe the effects of physical and chemical interactions on migration patterns in systems with multiple solutes. They establish criteria for sharp, spread, and hypersharp boundary forms and demonstrate the application of the moving boundary equation to selected migration patterns involving both physical and chemical interactions.
