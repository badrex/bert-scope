tldr: The author examines the spectra of argon gas and discovers two distinct sets of lines in its spectrum. They also find that argon may be a mixture of at least two elements, one glowing red and the other blue. The author discusses the similarities and differences between argon and nitrogen spectra and concludes that, based on spectrum work, argon may be a new member of the family of elementary bodies.
