tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the interactions between flames and shock waves in explosive gas mixtures. They observed a stable flame-shock complex and the effects of a flame kernel on wave systems. The results provide insights into the gas-dynamic aspects of detonation processes and the transition to detonation.
