tldr: This article discusses two cases of congenital night-blindness and explores the differences in color perception and light sensitivity between night-blind individuals and those with normal vision. The author examines the hereditary nature of night-blindness and its impact on the retina, suggesting that there may be an absence of sensitive rods in the retinas of night-blind individuals.
