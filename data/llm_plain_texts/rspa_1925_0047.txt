  - Inverse power law
tldr: The authors present a method to calculate crystal potential constants for cubic crystals, which are essential for understanding the potential energy of atoms in a crystal lattice. They evaluate these constants for different types of cubic crystals and discuss their implications for the crystal structure with a repulsive and attractive force between atoms.
