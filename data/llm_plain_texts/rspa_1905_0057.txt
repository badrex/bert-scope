tldr: 'The author conducted a survey of magnetic declination at the Royal Alfred Observatory, Mauritius, using a 12-inch theodolite and a magnet mounted on a teak table. They discovered three foci where the declination changed rapidly and found that the true undisturbed value of the declination at the observatory was about 9°45′, which was different from the value obtained on the old pier.'
