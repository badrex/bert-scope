tldr: The author presents an analytical method to determine bifurcations in impact oscillators, specifically focusing on grazing bifurcations. These bifurcations occur when part of an orbit just touches a stop, and the author finds both codimension one and codimension two bifurcations in the impact oscillator model. The study helps in understanding the behavior of impact oscillators in various engineering and physical systems.
