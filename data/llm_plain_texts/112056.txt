tldr: The author investigates the connection between blood vessels and lymphatic systems through injection experiments. They discovered a network of minute vessels, called the diaplasmatic system, which connects blood vessels and lymphatics. This system plays a role in secretion and absorption in tissues and may also help transport blood plasma and waste materials in deeper parts of the organism.
