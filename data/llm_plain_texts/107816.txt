tldr: Benjamin Bevan conducted experiments on the elasticity of ice and found that the modulus of elasticity for ice is about 2,100,000 feet. He also compared his findings to the modulus of water and found a close agreement. Bevan's experiments were conducted on ice with varying thickness and dimensions, and the results were consistent.
