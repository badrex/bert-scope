tldr: The author provides supplementary notes to a previous memoir on curves of the third order. They discuss the formation of equations of conics touching a cubic curve and the relationship between conics and tangents. The author also explores the concept of the "opposite" point of five consecutive points on a cubic curve and its applications.
