tldr: The authors investigated the metastable argon atoms present in a shock tube driven atomic beam. They detected the atoms and their velocity using the molecular beam method and found that the velocity of the atoms agreed well with the theoretical flow velocity of gas expanding supersonically from the region behind the reflected shock wave.
