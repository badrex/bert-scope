tldr: This article presents a method for measuring temperature in shock waves using the spectrum-line reversal technique. The authors adapted the sodium-line reversal method, commonly used for flame temperature measurement, for time-resolved studies of temperature behind shock waves produced by a bursting diaphragm. The sensitivity of the method allows for temperature determination with an accuracy of about ±30°C. The study focuses on air, nitrogen, and oxygen gases, providing general agreement between calculated and observed temperatures.
