tldr: The author, C. Matteucci, conducted experiments to study the secondary electromotor power of nerves and its effects on electrophysiological phenomena. He discovered that when a nerve is traversed by an electric current, it acquires a secondary electromotor power that can produce an electric current in the opposite direction. This phenomenon is not dependent on the vital properties of the nerves but is affected by their physical condition. The author explains the production of this secondary current and its application to the explanation of certain electro-physiological phenomena, such as the contractions of a limb when a circuit is opened.
