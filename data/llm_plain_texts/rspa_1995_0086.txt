tldr: The authors establish a correspondence between plane elasticity and two-dimensional real and complex dielectric equations in anisotropic media. They show that homogeneous orthotropic dielectric media correspond to orthotropic elastic media and find correspondences between orthotropic dielectric media and non-orthotropic elastic media. The study also extends to certain classes of inhomogeneous media, with applications to composite materials.
