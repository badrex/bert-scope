tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of temperature on traction in elastohydrodynamic lubrication. They found that as temperature increases, the maximum traction decreases, and the behavior of the lubricant changes from viscous to elastic. The study also showed that the pressure coefficient of viscosity remains constant over a range of pressures.
