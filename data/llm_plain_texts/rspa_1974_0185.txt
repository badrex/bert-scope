tldr: The authors studied electronic transitions at the diamond vacancy using optical absorption and uniaxial stress measurements. They found that the zero-phonon lines GR2 and GR3 are correlated with the GR1 lines and occur at the vacancy. The results provide evidence that these transitions take place at the GR1 defect center.
