tldr: The authors developed a two-dimensional mechanical model to study the interaction between muscle activation and body curvature in anguilliform fish. They found that the combination of elastic and viscous properties of the body tissues, along with muscle contractile forces, results in a wave of curvature traveling from head to tail during swimming. This model helps to understand the mechanics behind the observed relative timing of muscle activation and body curvature changes in anguilliform fish.
