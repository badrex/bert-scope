tldr: The authors developed a neural network model to study the evolution of animal communication and the coexistence of honest and exploitative signaling strategies. They found that signal cost ensures receivers obtain some honest information, but exploitative strategies can still gain short-term benefits. Honesty and cost are prerequisites for the evolution of exploitation, while cost-free signaling leads to a reduction in hidden preferences and potential for exploitation.
