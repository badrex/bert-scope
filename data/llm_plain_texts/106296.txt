tldr: The author, John Roebuck, conducted experiments to study the weight variations of heated and cooled bodies, particularly iron and copper. He found that when heated to a white heat, iron gained weight and when cooled, it lost weight. Copper, on the other hand, lost weight when heated and gained weight when cooled. These findings were contrary to the opinions of other philosophers at the time.
