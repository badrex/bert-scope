tldr: The study examines the development of a specific population of spinal cord neurons called Kolmer-Agduhr cells in frog embryos using GABA immunocytochemistry. The research shows that these neurons' axons grow in a highly specific, oriented manner from the earliest stages of outgrowth. The findings suggest that the direction of axon outgrowth is not random but rather rostral, providing insights into the mechanisms controlling and directing axon growth in the developing nervous system.
