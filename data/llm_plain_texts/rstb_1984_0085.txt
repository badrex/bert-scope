tldr: The study examines the groups of neuron cell bodies in the midline of the mesothoracic ganglion of adult male cockroaches, specifically focusing on the anterior median, mid-dorsal median, posterior dorsal median, posterior median, anterior ventral median, mid-ventral median, and posterior ventral median groups. The research provides information on the general appearance, position, numbers, and sizes of constituent somata, as well as the numbers and pathways of fiber bundles. The majority of these groups consist of interneurons, with a few efferent, presumed motor, neuron somata present in some.
