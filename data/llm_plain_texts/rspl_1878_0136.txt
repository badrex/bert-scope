tldr: The author investigates the development of the olfactory nerve and olfactory organ in vertebrates, finding that they share similarities with other cranial nerves and that the olfactory lobes do not necessarily have to be present for the olfactory nerve to function. The study also reveals that the olfactory nerve and the Schneiderian folds develop simultaneously in vertebrates.
