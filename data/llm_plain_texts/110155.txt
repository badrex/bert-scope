tldr: The author, Peter Barlow, presents a method for determining the dispersive ratio of glass and computing the radii of curvature for achromatic object-glasses. He explains his experimental approach, which involves measuring the refractive and relative dispersive powers of glasses and adapting them for use in telescopes. Barlow also discusses the validity of an empirical rule for calculating radii and the limits of error in spherical aberration and dispersion.
