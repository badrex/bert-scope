tldr: The study investigates the development of Ca-activated potassium currents in cochlear hair cells of the chick during embryogenesis. The researchers found that hair cells from a specific region of the chick's cochlea only acquire rapid Ca-activated potassium currents late in embryogenesis, which is when auditory function begins to rapidly mature. This discovery contributes to understanding the functional maturation of the chick's cochlea.
