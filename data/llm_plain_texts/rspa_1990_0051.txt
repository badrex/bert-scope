tldr: The author studies the way in which the transition amplitude to an initially unoccupied state increases to its exponentially small final value in the adiabatic approximation for a 2-state quantum system. By transforming to a series of superadiabatic bases, the transition histories renormalize onto a universal one, in which the amplitude grows to its final value as an error function. This universal transition history can be observed in spin experiments.
