tldr: The article presents an X-ray analysis of the crystalline complex between trimethylplatinum and 4:6-dioxononane. The crystal structure reveals that the -diketone residues act as tridentate ligands in the dimeric molecules, providing the first examples of -diketones acting as bridges in polynuclear complexes and as tridentate groups. The structure is loosely packed with no van der Waals contacts less than 3.2 Å between dimeric molecules.
