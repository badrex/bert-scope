tldr: This article explores the identity of John, the black bird-stuffer who taught Charles Darwin the art of preserving birds during Darwin's time as a medical student in Edinburgh. The author investigates various records and sources to determine if John was the same person who had traveled with Waterton and later worked in the Glasgow and Edinburgh museums. While the identity remains uncertain, the article provides valuable insights into Darwin's early life and the context of natural history in Edinburgh during that time.
