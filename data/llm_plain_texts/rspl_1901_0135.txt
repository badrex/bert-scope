tldr: This article investigates the relationship between the electric conductivity of iron alloys and the specific heats of the elements added to them. The author found that the addition of certain elements, such as silicon and aluminum, significantly increases the electric resistance of iron alloys. The study also suggests a correlation between the increase in electric resistivity and the specific heat of the added elements.
