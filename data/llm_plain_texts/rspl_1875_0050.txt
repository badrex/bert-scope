tldr: The author, Charles Meldrum and B. Stewart, investigated the connection between sunspot cycles and rainfall patterns. They found that years with more sunspots generally had higher rainfall, while years with fewer sunspots had lower rainfall. This relationship was observed in various regions around the world, suggesting that sunspots may play a role in influencing global weather patterns.
