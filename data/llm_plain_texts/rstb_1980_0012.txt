tldr: The article discusses the role of host nuclear RNA polymerase II in influenza viral RNA transcription. The authors found that viral RNA transcription in the infected cell is inhibited by a-amanitin, a specific inhibitor of RNA polymerase II. They proposed that viral RNA transcription in vivo requires initiation by primer RNAs synthesized by RNA polymerase II. The study also demonstrated that the 5' terminal methylated cap found on in-vivo viral mRNA is derived from the putative primer RNAs.
