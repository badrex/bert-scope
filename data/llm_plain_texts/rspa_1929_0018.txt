tldr: The authors study the crystal structures and potential energy of isomorphous crystals, specifically ruby and hematite. They calculate the electrostatic potential energy and the potential energy due to intrinsic repulsive forces between ions in these crystals, providing insights into their size and shape. This research contributes to understanding the importance of the hexagonal close-packed arrangement of ions in crystal structures.
