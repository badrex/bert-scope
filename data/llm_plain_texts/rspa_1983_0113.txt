tldr: This article presents a theoretical study of nonlinear unstable wave disturbances in fluidized beds. The authors develop a two-phase continuum model to analyze the evolution of finite-amplitude planar disturbances and their equilibration due to nonlinear effects. The study provides insights into the mechanisms leading to equilibration and the breakdown of disturbances into cross-stream perturbations, which contribute to the formation of bubble-like structures in fluidized beds.
