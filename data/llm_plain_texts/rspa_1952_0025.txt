tldr: The authors determined the energy expenditure per ion pair for electrons in various gases and gas mixtures using ion chambers and proportional counters with end-effect correcting terminals. They investigated the variation of energy expenditure with the energy of ionizing electrons in nitrogen and found only a small variation. The results are important for understanding energy measurement in atomic and nuclear physics.
