tldr: The author investigates the inconsistency of Sudarshan et al.'s generalized version of Dirac's positive-energy wave equation when coupled with an external electromagnetic field. The study shows that the equation does not remain consistent, contrary to the claims made by Sudarshan et al. The findings emphasize the connection between the wave equation for the hypothetical particle and the equation for an electron in the same field.
