tldr: This article discusses the experimental methods used to investigate the atmospheric deflection of electric waves and the nature of wireless signal variations. The authors employed automatic photographic registration, a suppressed ground-ray system, and artificial fading experiments to study the electric and magnetic vectors in the interference system produced at the ground. Their findings contribute to the understanding of fading and the behavior of radio signals in the atmosphere.
