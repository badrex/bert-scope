  - Penetration depth
tldr: The authors studied the surface impedance of superconductors and normal metals at high frequencies, focusing on the relationship between impedance and superconducting penetration depth. They developed a method to measure the skin reactance and applied it to mercury and tin, confirming previous findings and providing insights into the variation of penetration depth with temperature.
