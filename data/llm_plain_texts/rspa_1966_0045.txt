tldr: The authors study the behavior of a spherical plasma probe with an alternating potential applied to it. They derive the impedance of the probe and the rectified current as functions of the applied potential's frequency. The phenomenon of resonance rectification occurs at a frequency slightly less than the plasma frequency, which is explained using the Boltzmann-Vlasov equation and Maxwell's equations.
