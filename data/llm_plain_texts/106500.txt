tldr: 'The author, James Augustus Hamilton, observed the transit of Mercury over the Sun on November 12, 1782, using an achromatic telescope and a stop watch. He recorded the time of the first and last contact, and provided details of his observations and equipment. Hamilton also shared his estimated longitude and latitude based on his observations of eclipses, appulses, and lunar distances.'
