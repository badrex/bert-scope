tldr: Researchers observed a decay event of a -meson in a photographic emulsion exposed at high altitude. They analyzed the event, determined the mass of the particles involved, and concluded that the -meson decayed at rest. This observation provided valuable information about the properties of -mesons and contributed to the understanding of particle physics.
