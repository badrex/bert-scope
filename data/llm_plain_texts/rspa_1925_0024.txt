tldr: Researchers E. G. Dymond and Sir E. Rutherford improve the accuracy of critical potential measurements in gases by developing a new method using inelastic impact and electron velocity. Their technique helps confirm the numerical relationships of the quantum theory and provides a better understanding of gas physics.
