tldr: This article explores the evolution of sexual systems and sex allocation in plants when growth and reproduction overlap. The authors extend the classical resource allocation model to account for temporal displacement of male and female allocation, temporal change in resource availability, and nonlinear effects of early male allocation on later female allocation. The study reveals that the phenology of sexual reproduction in seed plants can affect the evolutionary stability of sexual systems, with sex allocations tending to be more female-biased and sexual systems including females evolving in larger regions of parameter space.
