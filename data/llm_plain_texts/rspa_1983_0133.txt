tldr: The authors present a complete and explicit example of a subcritical Hopf bifurcation in the rotating Benard problem, demonstrating the loss of stability of the steady conducting state. They show that the bifurcation is subcritical, meaning that the periodic solution is unstable, and the steady solution loses stability to a solution that is not a Hopf periodic solution.
