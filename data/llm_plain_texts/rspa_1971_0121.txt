tldr: The authors studied the reactions between tungsten surfaces and oxygen using reflexion high energy electron diffraction. They observed changes in interfacial geometry due to faceting and oxide nucleation. The study provides insights into the growth kinetics of oxides on metals and the effect of microscopic changes in the substrate surface on oxide growth.
