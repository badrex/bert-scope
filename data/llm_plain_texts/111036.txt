tldr: This study examines the effects of various substances, such as caustic potash, tartaric acid, and tartrate of soda, on the acidity of urine. The author, Henry Bence Jones, found that tartarate of potash had a significant effect on the alkalescence of urine, while tartaric acid increased the acidity. However, the stomach's impact on urine reaction remained evident in all cases.
