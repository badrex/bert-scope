tldr: This study investigates the withdrawal of a stratified fluid from a reservoir, focusing on the flow field and dynamics. The authors describe a series of laboratory experiments and discuss the implications of their findings for reservoir management and quality control. They also explore the discrepancies between different theoretical models and their own experimental results, suggesting that the flow field is history-dependent.
