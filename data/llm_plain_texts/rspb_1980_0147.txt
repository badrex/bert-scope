tldr: The article discusses the organization and coding capacity of the polyoma virus genome, focusing on the early region that codes for three viral proteins: large, middle, and small T-antigens. The author proposes a two-stage model for cellular transformation by polyoma virus, involving the small T-antigen in the first stage and the large and middle T-antigens in the second stage. The model takes into account the major assays for transformation and the viral proteins involved at each stage.
