tldr: This article discusses the hereditary blood factors of the peoples of New Guinea and surrounding regions. Blood specimens were collected and tested for various blood groups and serum groups, as well as red-cell isoenzymes. The results showed that the blood groups in New Guinea varied less in frequency compared to neighboring regions, providing valuable information for understanding the relationships between populations. The study also highlights the influence of language, culture, and physical observations in classifying human populations.
