tldr: This study investigates the high strain-rate shear response and fracture behavior of polycarbonate (PC) and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) using a split Hopkinson torsion bar. The yield and fracture behaviors of both materials are compared with previous data and existing theories. The results show that PC yields in accordance with the Eyring theory of viscous flow, while PMMA fractures before yielding in high strain-rate tests. The fracture stress for both materials obeys a thermal activation rate theory of Eyring type, and failure is due to the initiation and breakdown of a craze at the fracture stress. The fracture surfaces reveal that failure is by the nucleation and propagation of inclined mode I microcracks, which link to form a stepped fracture surface.
