tldr: The author developed a reciprocating expansion apparatus to detect and track individual ionizing rays, such as X-rays and radioactive substance rays. The device uses a cloud chamber with a glass cylinder and a piston that moves up and down, creating a supersaturated environment for the gas. The apparatus can be used to study the structure of ethereal waves and other delicate questions related to ionizing radiation.
