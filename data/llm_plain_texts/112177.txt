tldr: The author, Arthur Cayley, explores Tschirnhausen's transformation and its application to quartic equations. He discovers an identical equation that helps express the cubinvariant and finds that the transformed function is linearly equivalent to a specific equation involving a single parameter. This result is of considerable interest in the study of invariants and quartic equations.
