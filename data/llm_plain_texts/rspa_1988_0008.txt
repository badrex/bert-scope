tldr: This article studies stress waves and energy flux in micropolar elastic media with orthorhombic symmetry. The authors derive the equations of motion and constitutive relations for these media and obtain the general form of the energy flux. They examine several tractable cases and discuss the implications of their findings for wave propagation in orthorhombic continua.
