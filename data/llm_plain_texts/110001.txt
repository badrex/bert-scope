tldr: The author, William Hyde Wollaston, discusses the extent of the Earth's atmosphere and the possibility of ultimate atoms. He examines the lack of atmosphere around the Moon and the Sun, and the phenomenon of Jupiter's satellites. Wollaston argues that the existence of ultimate atoms of definite magnitude, no longer divisible by repulsion of their parts, could explain the Earth's atmosphere.
