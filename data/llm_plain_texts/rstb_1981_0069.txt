tldr: 'The article discusses the three-dimensional structure and catalytic mechanism of triose phosphate isomerase, an enzyme that plays a crucial role in glycolysis. The crystal structures of the chicken muscle and yeast enzymes are analyzed, revealing a similar conformation of the polypeptide chain. The active site contains a key glutamic acid residue believed to act as a base in the reaction. Crystallographic studies of the enzyme's binding with dihydroxyacetone phosphate suggest a mechanism involving polarization of the substrate carbonyl group.'
