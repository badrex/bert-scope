tldr: The authors examine the influence of diffracting vectors on the visibility of dislocations in iron using transmission electron microscopy. They find that dislocations can effectively go out of contrast under certain diffracting conditions, which has led to erroneous deductions of the Burgers vectors of dislocations in the past. The study highlights the importance of considering the size of diffracting vectors and the deviation parameter in understanding dislocation visibility and determining Burgers vectors accurately.
