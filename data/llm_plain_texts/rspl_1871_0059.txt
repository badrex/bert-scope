tldr: This article discusses the fossil mammals of Australia, specifically the Phascolomys species. The author, Prof. R. Owen, describes the osteological and dental characters of the extinct species and compares them to the existing ones. He also highlights the differences in size and shape of the jaws and teeth of these species. The author concludes that the larger extinct Wombats have perished, and the smaller ones, like the existing Wombats, can escape pursuit and observation by using underground retreats.
