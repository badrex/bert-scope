tldr: This article describes a rocket experiment that measured the electron temperatures in the solar chromosphere and corona. The researchers determined the electron temperatures by measuring the intensity ratio of pairs of emission lines from lithium-like ions, such as neon and magnesium. The results provide an experimental check on theoretical temperatures calculated using ionization equilibrium assumptions. The study contributes to our understanding of the solar atmosphere and its behavior.
