tldr: The authors develop a gauge theory of the Weyl group, which is a semi-direct product of the Poincare group and space-time dilations. They explore the geometrical implications of the theory, discussing the introduction of three sets of gauge fields that provide a local affine connection and a vierbein system. The resulting geometry has an affine connection that is not symmetric but is semi-metric, and the theory can be further generalized to incorporate matter fields.
