tldr: This article discusses the discovery of a dorsal dermal spine of the Hylaeosaurus, a fossil reptile, in the Strata of Tilgate Forest. The author, Gideon Algernon Mantell, examines the structure and origin of these spines, which were initially thought to be a serrated crest along the back of the Hylaeosaurus. After 18 years, Mantell obtained a new specimen that confirmed his original interpretation of the spines' function. The article highlights the importance of further examination and understanding of dinosaur anatomy and paleontology.
