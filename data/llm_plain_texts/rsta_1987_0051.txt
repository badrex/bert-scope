tldr: This article presents an advanced mathematical study on the asymptotic estimates of eigenvalues in a sixth-order boundary-value problem. The author uses global phase-integral methods to obtain these estimates, providing a more accurate approach to solving the problem. The results are essential for understanding the behavior of solutions near the boundary conditions.
