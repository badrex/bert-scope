tldr: The article explores the use of Clifford algebras as a framework for constructing vector-valued rational forms, offering advantages over the usual scalar theory. It demonstrates how these forms can be used to create vector-valued Pade approximants and rational interpolants, and shows the close connection between these constructs and generalized inverse rational forms. The article also provides examples of simple vector-valued Pade approximants and their properties.
