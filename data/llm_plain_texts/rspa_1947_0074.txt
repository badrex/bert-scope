tldr: The authors studied the vibration spectrum and molecular configuration of cyclohexane using a valency force field. They calculated the vibration frequencies of the 'chair' structure and found that the experimental frequencies were compatible with the 'chair' configuration. The study provided information about the strengths of the C-C bonds in the molecule.
