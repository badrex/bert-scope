  - Respiratory stigmata
  - Morphology
tldr: The author examines the similarities in the adult structure of Limulus and Scorpio, specifically focusing on their respiratory organs, external features, and internal anatomy. These similarities suggest a close relationship between the two animals, supporting the classification of Limulus as an Arachnid. The author also discusses the suppression of abdominal segmentation in both animals and their shared fossil forms, Eurypterina.
