tldr: The author investigates the role of diffusion and convection in catalytic reactions involving colloidal metals. They find that convection currents play a significant part in accelerating the reactions, and that the assumption of a heterogeneous reaction with a stationary liquid does not hold true. The study provides insights into the factors affecting reaction velocities and the importance of considering both diffusion and convection in understanding catalytic processes.
