tldr: The author, David Brewster, explores the production of regular double refraction in the molecules of bodies by simple pressure and the origin of the doubly refracting structure. He demonstrates that pressure can change the molecular structure and create new optical properties, such as double refraction. This research contributes to the understanding of the relationship between molecular structure and optical properties in crystals.
