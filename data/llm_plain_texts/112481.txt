tldr: The author, A.W. Hofmann, investigates the formation of new cyanides isomeric with nitriles and their properties. He demonstrates that these isomers can be obtained through the action of chloroform on primary monamines and by treating cyanide of silver with alcoholic iodides. The study of these reactions has implications for the generation of polycyanides and the potential existence of a series of bodies isomeric with the sulphocyanides.
