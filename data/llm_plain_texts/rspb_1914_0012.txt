tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effect of light on the transpiration of leaves. They found that the rate of transpiration decreases in the dark and increases in the light. The average proportion between transpiration in light and darkness is 119:100. This research helps to understand how plants regulate water loss through their leaves in response to light conditions.
