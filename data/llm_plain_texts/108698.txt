tldr: This article presents experiments conducted on the resistance of glass globes and cylinders to collapse and the tensile and compressive strength of various types of glass. The author tested three kinds of glass and found that the resistance of glass cylinders to compression follows a similar law as sheet-iron cylinders. The results provide valuable information on the cohesive properties of glass and contribute to the understanding of the strength of materials.
