tldr: This study investigates the association between phenols and cyanides in carbon tetrachloride solutions. The authors found that the bonding occurs through the nitrogen atom's lone pair electrons. They determined equilibrium constants for the formation of complexes and observed that steric factors, like bulky ortho-substituted phenols, can restrict hydrogen bond formation. The group vibration band is also affected, with most bonded vibrations being shifted to higher frequencies.
