tldr: Thomas Huxley's paper discusses his observations on Appendicularia and Doliolum, two Ascidian genera with significant interest in their unique characteristics and roles in the evolution and development of Ascidians. Appendicularia represents the larval state of Ascidians, while Doliolum serves as a link between Pyrosomata and Salpoe. The paper also raises questions about the independence of Doliolum and its potential relation to the genus Auchenia.
