tldr: This study investigates the free surface oscillations and tides of Lakes Michigan and Superior, identifying the first five free gravitational, barotropic modes (surface seiches) and their frequencies. The research also discusses the phase progression of these modes, the structure of other oscillations, and the differences in tidal behavior between the two lakes. The findings provide valuable insights into the hydrodynamics of these large freshwater basins.
