tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the plasticity and penetrability of ice at different temperatures using freezing mixtures and pendulum experiments. They found that the plasticity of ice varies with temperature and that natural lake ice has a greater absence of uniformity in penetrability compared to specially prepared pure ice blocks. The author also discovered that the composition of water affects the properties of the ice frozen from it.
