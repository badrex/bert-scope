tldr: This article discusses the structure and function of smooth tonic muscles in lamellibranch molluscs. The authors examine the role of tropomyosin and the sliding filament mechanism in these muscles, and propose that the large amounts of tropomyosin found in these muscles serve to strengthen the thick filaments, allowing them to bear the tension produced by the long linkage series. This research helps to understand the unique properties of these muscles and their contraction mechanisms.
