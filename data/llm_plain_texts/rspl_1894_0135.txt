tldr: The author investigates the absorption spectra of dilute solutions, focusing on the changes in color and molecular conditions of dissolved substances. They explore the effects of electrolytic dissociation and hydrolysis on the absorption spectra and provide a detailed method for measuring the absorbed light in dilute solutions. This study offers valuable insights into the molecular conditions of dissolved substances and their interaction with light.
