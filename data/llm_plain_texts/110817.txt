tldr: William Robert Grove conducted experiments on the gas voltaic battery to understand its action and potential applications. He found that chlorine and oxygen, as well as hydrogen and carbonic oxide, were the most effective gases for producing a voltaic current. Grove also explored the use of the gas battery in eudiometry, analyzing the composition of atmospheric air and mixed gases.
