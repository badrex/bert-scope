tldr: This article explores the influence of autocatalysis on the speed of chemical waves in reaction-diffusion systems. The authors study the propagation of one-dimensional wave fronts in systems with combinations of quadratic and cubic autocatalysis, focusing on the variation of wave speed with the relative contributions of the two processes. They discuss the selection of permanent form traveling waves and analyze the behavior of chemical waves in systems with different forms of autocatalysis.
