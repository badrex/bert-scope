tldr: The study investigates the electrical activity of the lateral geniculate nucleus in cats after stimulating the optic nerve. The researchers found that the synaptic delay averages 0.4 ms, and the post-synaptic activity consists of a slow negative potential and a propagated axonal spike. The results provide insights into the mechanism of synaptic transmission in the lateral geniculate nucleus and contribute to understanding the electrical correlates of visual processing in the brain.
