tldr: 'Edward Charles Cyril Baly was a prominent chemist and spectroscopist who made significant contributions to the fields of spectroscopy, absorption spectra, and photochemistry. He was also a skilled glass-blower, teacher, and musician. Baly's career included positions at University College London and Liverpool University, where he inspired generations of students and conducted important research. His work on the selective absorption spectra of organic compounds and the emission spectra of rare gases helped establish him as an expert in spectroscopy.'
