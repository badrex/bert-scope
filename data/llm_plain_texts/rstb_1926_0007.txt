tldr: The author investigates the development of the calcareous test in Echinus miliaris, from the larval stage to the adult form. They describe the order in which the skeletal elements appear and provide detailed accounts of the development of spines, sphaeridia, pedicellariae, tube-foot discs, and the rudiments of the lantern of Aristotle. This study contributes to the understanding of echinoderm development and the formation of their unique skeletal structures.
