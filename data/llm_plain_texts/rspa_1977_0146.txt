tldr: The authors present a generalized field theory using a tetrad-space, which extends the geometrical structure of general relativity. They derive a unique set of field equations with 16 variables, representing a natural generalization applicable to various physical purposes. The theory is based on the concept of variational derivatives and introduces new elements to maintain consistency with the general principle of covariance.
