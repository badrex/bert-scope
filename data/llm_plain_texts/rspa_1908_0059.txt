tldr: The author, George M. Minchin, explores the properties of seleno-aluminium bridges, which are sensitive to light and have varying conductivity depending on the intensity of the light. He examines the relationship between the light intensity and the current in the bridge, and discusses the potential applications of these bridges in various fields.
