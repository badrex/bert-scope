tldr: The study investigates the presence of bacterial symbionts in marine sponges and provides immunological evidence suggesting that these symbioses may have originated during the Precambrian era, before the evolution of the current sponge orders and classes. Sponge-specific bacterial strains were isolated from various sponge species and regions, and their antigens were analyzed. The findings indicate that these strains share common ancestors and have widespread geographical and taxonomic distributions.
