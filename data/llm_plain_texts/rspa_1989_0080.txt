tldr: The authors investigate the higher-order moments and cumulants of sums of random variables with long-range dependence. They use tensor methods to simplify calculations and study the limiting forms of second and third cumulants as the number of variables added becomes large. The implications of their findings are discussed for the existence of non-gaussian limits of sums of random quantities of finite variance and long-range dependence.
