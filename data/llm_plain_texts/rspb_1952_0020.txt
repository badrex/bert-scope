tldr: The X zone, a layer of cells in the adrenal glands of young mature female mice, disappears during the first pregnancy. The study found that the ovary plays a crucial role in the process, and the mechanism involves the production of a luteotropic substance by the developing embryo's trophoblast, which in turn affects the corpus luteum and leads to the disappearance of the X zone.
