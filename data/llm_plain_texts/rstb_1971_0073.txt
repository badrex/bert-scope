tldr: The article investigates the uptake of ferritin into neurosecretory terminals in the corpus cardiacum of stick insects. The study reveals that ferritin particles penetrate the extracellular space and are found in specific locations, such as large depressions, large electron-lucent vesicles, and small electron-lucent vesicles. The findings support the idea that neurosecretory products are released through exocytosis and provide insights into the dynamics of the release process.
