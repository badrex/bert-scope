tldr: The author investigates the influence of homodromous and heterodromous electric currents on the transmission of excitation in plant and animal conducting tissues. They discovered that excitation travels better against the direction of an electric current, indicating that an electric current confers a preferential or selective direction of conductivity for excitation. This research has implications for understanding the similarities between plant and animal conducting tissues.
