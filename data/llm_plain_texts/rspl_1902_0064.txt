tldr: The authors discovered an intracellular toxin in the typhoid bacillus by growing the organism on natural body soils and disintegrating it at the temperature of liquid air. This toxin is toxic or fatal when inoculated into animals in small doses. The study contributes to understanding the nature of the typhoid bacillus and its potential implications for immunization and treatment.
