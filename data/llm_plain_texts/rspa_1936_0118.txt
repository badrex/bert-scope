tldr: The authors conducted experiments in an underground station to study the absorption of cosmic radiation and the production of cosmic ray showers. They used Geiger-Muller counters to measure the rate of coincident discharges and found that the intensity of cosmic rays was higher towards the east. The authors also attempted to detect showers using a lead block and a pentagonal arrangement of counters, but the results were inconclusive due to low cosmic ray intensity at the underground level.
