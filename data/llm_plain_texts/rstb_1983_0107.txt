tldr: This article discusses the diverse photoperception systems in plant photomovement, focusing on the different types of responses, such as photokinesis, photophobic response, and phototaxis. The author explains how these responses are controlled by light and how they vary in different organisms. The article also explores the role of photosynthesis in these responses and the potential for generalizing these findings to other organisms.
