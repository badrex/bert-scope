tldr: The author, William John Macquorn Rankine, introduces the concept of water-line curves, or neoids, and their application in ship design. He explains the principles of fluid flow past a solid body and how water-line curves can be used to determine good forms of water-line for ships. The author also discusses the properties of neoids generated by a circle and their geometrical meaning.
