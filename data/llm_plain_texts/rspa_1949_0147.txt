tldr: This study examines the flow of a swirling liquid under gravity through an orifice-plate, using relaxation methods to determine the velocity distribution and air-core shape. The research also investigates the different types of emergent jets formed under varying conditions of swirl. Experiments with water were conducted for comparison with the theoretical calculations.
