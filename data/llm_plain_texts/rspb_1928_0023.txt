tldr: This study investigates the effect of varying carbon dioxide supply on the rate of assimilation in submerged water plants. The researchers compared the use of carbon dioxide solutions and sodium bicarbonate solutions, finding that the type of solution significantly affects the rate of assimilation. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the factors influencing plant growth and photosynthesis.
