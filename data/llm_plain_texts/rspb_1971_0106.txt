tldr: This article discusses the immunological properties of penicillins and the role of protein impurities in causing allergic reactions. The authors demonstrate that by using pronase, a proteolytic enzyme, to selectively digest protein impurities, the immunogenicity of penicillins can be reduced. They also develop a water-insoluble form of pronase that can be used to further reduce the immunogenicity and antigenicity of penicillin preparations.
