tldr: The authors conducted a combined experimental and theoretical study on the sorption of krypton in silicalite, a porous silica polymorph. They used volumetric sorption methods and computer modeling calculations to identify three main sites for sorption of the rare gas. The study provides insights into the site-energy distribution and helps understand the structure and properties of silicalite, a material with potential applications in heterogeneous catalysis.
