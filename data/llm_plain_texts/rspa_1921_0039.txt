tldr: This article explores the behavior of moving striations in a neon tube under various conditions, such as pressure, current, and temperature. The authors discovered three types of striations with different velocities and characteristics, and they studied their behavior under different conditions. They also investigated the effect of a magnetic field on the striations and found that it affected the second type of striations.
