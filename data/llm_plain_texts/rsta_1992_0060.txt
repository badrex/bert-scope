tldr: This article discusses time-resolved macromolecular crystallography, a technique used to study the chemical and structural events in protein crystals. The authors describe their experiments using microspectrophotometry to investigate protein-ligand interactions, conformational changes, and reaction kinetics in crystalline proteins. They emphasize the importance of these findings in planning and interpreting structural studies, especially in the context of time-resolved crystallography.
