tldr: The authors developed a self-recording device called the "Stomatograph" to measure the mean stomatal aperture of a leaf and study stomatal movement in plants, particularly in cotton plants in Egypt. The device records changes in stomatal porosity by measuring the velocity of air passing through the leaf tissues under constant pressure. This innovation allowed for precise and sensitive air-pump measurements, providing valuable insights into plant-water relationships and the impact of environmental factors on stomatal behavior.
