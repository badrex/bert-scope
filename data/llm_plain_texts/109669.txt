tldr: 'Thomas Andrew Knight investigates the role of alburnous tubes in tree physiology. He concludes that these tubes are not responsible for transporting sap, but instead, act as reservoirs for fluid secreted by the bark. Knight proposes that the cellular substance is the primary pathway for sap transport, and the alburnous tubes provide structural support. This research contributes to our understanding of tree growth and development.'
