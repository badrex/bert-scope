tldr: The authors conducted a gravimetric study of the precipitin reaction between antiserum and homologous protein. They found that the weight of the precipitate formed is directly proportional to the amount of antiserum, provided the quantity of homologous protein exceeds a certain minimal amount. This research helps in understanding the interaction between antibodies and antigens, which is essential for studying immune responses and developing diagnostic tests.
