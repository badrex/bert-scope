revised_title: Lunar Surface Erosion and Solar Wind Sputter Processes: A New Appraisal from Space Missions and Laboratory Analyses
semantic_tags:
  - Lunar surface erosion
  - Solar wind sputter processes
  - Impact crater formation
  - Erosion modeling
  - Microparticle flux
tldr: This article discusses the characterization of lunar surface impact erosion and solar wind sputter processes on the Moon. The authors develop mathematical models and computer programs to analyze the various erosion processes, such as impact crater formation, solar wind sputtering, and catastrophic rupture. They also examine the microparticle flux and its recent time dependence, considering possible sources like comets and impact comminution particles within 1 AU. The study provides insights into the erosion processes and probable meteoroid influx rates on the lunar surface.
