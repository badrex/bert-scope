tldr: The authors describe the anatomy and ultrastructure of the lamprey labyrinth, focusing on the sensory areas and their hair cells. They identify three main portions of the macula, each with a unique arrangement of sensory cells. The lamprey labyrinth has a unique feature: large ciliated chambers that maintain a pattern of four endolymph vortices. The findings provide a basis for understanding the lamprey's sensory system and its evolutionary relationships with other vertebrates.
