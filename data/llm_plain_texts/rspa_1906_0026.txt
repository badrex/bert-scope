tldr: This article explores various mathematical concepts of the material world, focusing on the axioms and properties of a set of entities forming a relation R. The author investigates how Euclidean Geometry can be applied to express properties of the field of R, considering the introduction of time, velocity, and acceleration. The article also discusses the theories of interpoints and dimensions, as well as alternative concepts like Concept V, which may have potential applications in physical science.
