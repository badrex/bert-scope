tldr: This article discusses the use of fractal bifurcation sets and renormalization strange sets to study the complex behavior of dynamical systems, such as the transition to chaos. The author introduces the concept of universal invariants, which can help understand the structure and universality of these complex processes. The article also explores the application of these ideas to critical circle maps and other dynamical systems.
