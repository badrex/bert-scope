tldr: The study examines the habitat exploitation and foraging behavior of the brown long-eared bat, Plecotus auritus. The bats were found to have a unique nocturnal activity pattern, using a series of feeding sites in deciduous woodland, and displaying a preference for deciduous over coniferous woodland. The bats' foraging behavior reflects their morphological specializations and shows a degree of intraspecific flexibility. Deciduous woodland in the vicinity of roost sites appears to be key foraging habitat for P. auritus.
