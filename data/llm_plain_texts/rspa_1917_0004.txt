tldr: The author investigated the properties of double selenates of the nickel group, including potassium nickel selenate, rubidium nickel selenate, cesium nickel selenate, and ammonium nickel selenate. They found that the physical and morphological properties of these salts follow a progression based on the atomic weight of the alkali metal. The study also revealed a strong structural similarity between the rubidium and ammonium salts, which has important implications for the understanding of crystallography and the theory of valency volumes.
