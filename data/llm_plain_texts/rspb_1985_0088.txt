tldr: The authors studied the central regeneration of an identified molluscan interneuron, R.Pe.D.l, in the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis. They found that axonal lesion initiates extensive neuritic outgrowth from the portion of the interneuron, which is highly specific in parts of the brain and peripheral nerves formally innervated by R.Pe.D.l. The extent of neuritic sprouting depends on the site of axonal lesion. This research provides insights into the accuracy with which connections are reformed following neuronal injury in invertebrates.
