tldr: The author discusses the concept of cotidal lines, which represent the high tide points at the same time, and how they are affected by the motion of water and the shape of the Earth. They explain the differences between primary and derivative tides and how the velocity of tidal waves is influenced by factors such as depth and the presence of landmasses.
