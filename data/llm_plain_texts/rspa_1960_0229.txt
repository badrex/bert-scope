tldr: This study investigates the hysteresis in the hydrogen pressure versus composition relationship in the palladium-hydrogen system. The authors analyze the main hysteresis loop and the absorption and desorption scanning curves, examining the hysteresis in terms of Lacher's statistical mechanical theory of hydrogen in palladium. They also discuss the co-existence of both α and β-phases over a range of pressures and propose a tentative theory to account for the ranges of co-existence of the two phases in absorption and desorption.
