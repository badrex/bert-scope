tldr: The article investigates the structure and expression of differentiation antigens on functional subclasses of primary sensory neurons, specifically those related to nociception and pain. The researchers use monoclonal antibodies to identify carbohydrate epitopes associated with lacto- and globo-series glycolipids, which may play a role in the development and specification of sensory connections in the spinal cord. The study finds that certain carbohydrate sequences are expressed by functional subpopulations of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, which could reflect or contribute to the differentiation of these neurons.
