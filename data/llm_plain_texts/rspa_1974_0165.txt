tldr: The author discusses the results of the Copernicus satellite, focusing on the detection of three interstellar molecules: H2, HD, and CO. The study found that H2 and CO are abundant in interstellar space, while HD is much rarer. The findings support theories about the formation and distribution of molecular hydrogen in dense clouds.
