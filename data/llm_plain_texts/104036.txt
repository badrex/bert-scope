tldr: The author describes a complicated surgical case of an inguinal rupture with a pin in the appendix caeci encrusted with stone. The patient had a fistula between the scrotum and thigh, and the rupture was small and not troublesome. The author performed a difficult operation, which involved dissection and amputation of the affected gut. The patient recovered well, and the wound healed in less than a month. This case study provides valuable insights into the surgical techniques and challenges of the time.
