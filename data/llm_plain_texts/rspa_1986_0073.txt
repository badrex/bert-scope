tldr: This study investigates the effect of sheet thickness on the ductility limits of metallic sheets during the process of punch stretching. A novel finite strain shell theory is developed to model the deformation of a thick circular plate, and a consistent onset of localization criterion is proposed. Experimental results and numerical calculations show that the sheet's thickness has little influence on the critical strain for plate thicknesses commonly used in sheet forming.
