tldr: The authors conducted experiments to compare the effects of nicotine and other pyridine bases on muscle. They found that nicotine had the most significant impact on muscle contraction and that its effect could be antagonized by curare. The study also showed that the muscle protein could be divided between two bases or displaced by a stronger base, providing insight into the interaction between drugs and muscle tissue.
