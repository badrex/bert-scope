tldr: This study investigates the thalamo-cortical connections of the parietal and frontal lobes in the monkey brain. The authors found that the main sensory nucleus of the thalamus projects onto the sensory areas of the cortex, and they also examined the connections of the greater part of the frontal and parietal regions of the cerebral cortex. Their findings contribute to the understanding of how sensory impulses are relayed and processed in the brain.
