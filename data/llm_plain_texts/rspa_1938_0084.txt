tldr: The author discusses the quantum theory of Einstein-Bose particles and their role in nuclear interaction. They consider Yukawa's suggestion that the nuclear interaction is transmitted by charged particles obeying Einstein-Bose statistics and analyze various aspects of this theory. The study focuses on Proca's equations and their quantization, leading to the conclusion that a specific case with spin is the most suitable for explaining nuclear interaction.
