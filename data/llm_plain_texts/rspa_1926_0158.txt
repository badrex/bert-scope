tldr: The authors investigated the spectrum of fluorine using different conditions of excitation and identified at least three successive spectra. They assigned the lines produced to the neutral atom of fluorine and provided a classification of these lines. The study also included the identification of term combinations and the analysis of the Zeeman effects for some of the lines.
