  - Weather patterns
tldr: The author examines the relation between the phases of horizontal and vertical microseismic waves to understand their direction of approach. By analyzing phase differences between the components, the author concludes that microseisms are most likely Rayleigh waves traveling from the northwest to the southeast, indicating the influence of atmospheric pressure and weather patterns on these seismic events.
