tldr: This study investigates the electrical conductivities of aqueous solutions of sodium dodecyl sulfate and sodium hexadecyl sulfate at different temperatures. The authors found that the conductivity of these solutions increases due to micelle formation, which is influenced by the length of the alkyl chain and the distance between anions. The results provide insights into the behavior of strong electrolytes and support the Debye-Huckel theory of ionic interaction.
