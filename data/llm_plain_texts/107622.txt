tldr: The author conducted observations with the eight-foot astronomical circle at Trinity College Observatory in Dublin to investigate the effects of parallax and aberration on the positions of certain fixed stars. The results showed that some stars exhibited a noticeable parallax, supporting the explanation by parallax. The author also discussed the importance of these findings for understanding the nature of light and the constant of aberration.
