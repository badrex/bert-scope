tldr: 'This article discusses the processes of wet and dry deposition of atmospheric pollutants, such as sulfur and nitrogen compounds, onto terrestrial surfaces. It explores the different mechanisms, including diffusiophoresis, thermophoresis, and impaction, that contribute to the transfer of these pollutants to the ground. The article also highlights the importance of understanding these processes to estimate regional inputs of these compounds and their ecological effects on the environment.'
