tldr: This article investigates the propagation of Rayleigh waves in a semi-infinite elastic solid within the framework of the linear theory of thermoelasticity. The authors study two special cases: when the surface of the solid is maintained at constant temperature (case 1) and when the surface is thermally insulated (case 2). They find that thermoelastic Rayleigh waves have two different modes of propagation: quasi-elastic (E-) modes and quasi-thermal (T-) modes. The authors also determine the speeds of propagation and attenuation coefficients of the various surface modes in both cases.
