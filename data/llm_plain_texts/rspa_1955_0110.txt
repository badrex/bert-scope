tldr: The authors measured the scattering cross-sections of ortho- and para-hydrogen for slow neutrons to determine the triplet and singlet scattering amplitudes of the neutron-proton interaction. They used a neutron velocity selector and a hydrogen gas sample at a low temperature to ensure a small proportion of collisions with non-zero energy differences. The results provide valuable information for understanding the neutron-proton force and the scattering amplitudes in the phenomenological theory of the interaction.
