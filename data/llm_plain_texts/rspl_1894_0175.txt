  - Dielectric hysteresis
tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate the nature of the two spectra of oxygen. They explored the possibility that the spectra are produced by different gases or different modifications of oxygen. Additionally, they studied the phenomenon of dielectric hysteresis in a condenser and its relation to the rate of dissipation of energy.
