tldr: This article presents a general theory of quasistatic crack propagation in nonlinear structures, focusing on the cracking of strips, plates, and cylindrical shells. The theory is applied to various practical situations, such as the peeling of adhesive tape and out-of-plane tearing of paper. Experiments are described to support and illustrate the theory, which is limited to cases where reversible deformation occurs in the bulk of the body, and irreversible processes are confined to a boundary layer along the crack surfaces.
