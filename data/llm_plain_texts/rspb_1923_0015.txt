tldr: This study investigates the relationship between arterial elasticity and blood pressure in humans. The researchers found that as blood pressure increases, the extensibility of arteries decreases. This is important because more extensible arteries require less work from the heart and provide a more regular blood flow in the capillaries. The study also presents a method to measure arterial extensibility at various internal pressures up to the diastolic pressure.
