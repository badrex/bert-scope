tldr: The author presents an analysis of the electromagnetic field into moving elements, showing that the most general electromagnetic field can be represented by a vector of invariant magnitude with lines of force moving at right angles to themselves. This analysis reveals that small moving elements of the field can be constructed, which can be regarded as keeping their identities permanently as they move, exhibiting both translatory and rotational movements.
