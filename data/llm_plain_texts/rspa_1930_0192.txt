tldr: This article presents a new formula for the potential energy of a diatomic molecule, specifically the hydrogen molecule. The formula is derived from a separate consideration of all the forces acting on the molecule and is applicable to the full range of internuclear distances. The authors demonstrate that the formula provides a fair representation of the mean force exerted by the electronic system on the nuclei, improving upon previous methods that were only valid for limited ranges of distances.
