tldr: This article describes the events and observations of an earthquake that occurred in Oxford and its surroundings on September 17, 1683. The author discusses the weather conditions, the height of the mercury in the barometer, and the presence of ignes fatui (strange lights) before the earthquake. The earthquake itself was not of the violent type, but rather a trembling motion that lasted only a few seconds. The author also mentions the accompanying sound, similar to distant thunder, and compares it to the groaning of wooden planks when heated. The article provides insights into the understanding of earthquakes and their relationship with atmospheric conditions during that time.
