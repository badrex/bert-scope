tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of extremely low temperatures, specifically the temperature of liquid hydrogen, on bacterial vitality. They found that exposing bacteria to a temperature of about -252Â°C for ten hours had no appreciable effect on their vitality. This research contributes to the understanding of life under extreme conditions and has implications for the study of bacterial survival in cold environments.'
