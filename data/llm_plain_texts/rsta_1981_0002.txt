tldr: This study presents a linear stratified ocean model to understand the behavior of the equatorial undercurrent. The model considers the effects of radiation-trapped Rossby and Kelvin waves, which are essential for developing a realistic undercurrent. The model supports the existence of vertical modes that adjust to Sverdrup balance and generate the characteristic meridional circulation pattern associated with equatorial Ekman pumping.
