revised_title: Surface Mobility and Emission Distribution in Tungsten, Molybdenum, and Nickel Single Crystal Metal Points

tldr: The authors conducted experiments on single crystal metal points of tungsten, molybdenum, and nickel to study the distribution of autelectronic emission. They discovered that surface mobility occurs above 1170Â°C for tungsten, molybdenum, and nickel. The changes in emission distribution can be explained by the change in the geometrical shape of the point due to the action of the high external field on the mobile surface atoms. The authors also discussed the flash-over phenomenon in high vacuum and the effect of small traces of gas on the emission distribution.
