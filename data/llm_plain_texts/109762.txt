tldr: The author, William Hyde Wollaston, describes a method of freezing at a distance using an instrument called Cryophorus. The instrument consists of a tube with two balls, one containing water to be frozen and the other a vacuum. When the empty ball is placed in a freezing mixture, the water in the other ball freezes within a few minutes. This method demonstrates the transfer of heat and the generation of cold at a distance.
