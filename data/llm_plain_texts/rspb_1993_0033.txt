tldr: The author discovered a covert form of iridovirus infection in blackfly larvae that does not show obvious symptoms. Using techniques like injecting larvae into a permissive lepidopteran host and polymerase chain reaction, the author confirmed the presence of iridovirus DNA in host tissues. This finding expands our understanding of iridovirus infections in invertebrates and their ecological impact.
