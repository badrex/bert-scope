tldr: This article presents the completion of a magnetic survey of the South Polar Regions conducted between 1840-1845. The survey was undertaken by the British government and involved observations of the Earth's magnetic field, including declination, inclination, and intensity. The findings are accompanied by three maps illustrating the isogonic, isoclinal, and isodynamic lines. The paper also discusses the revision of Gauss's 'Allgemeine Theory des Erdmagnetismus'.
