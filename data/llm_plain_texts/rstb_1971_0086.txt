tldr: The authors studied salt and water transport in living tissues, specifically in isolated frog skin. They discovered that only a small fraction of the sodium in the epithelium participates in transepithelial transport. The authors also investigated the localization of permeability barriers in frog skin epithelium using tracers like ruthenium red and colloidal lanthanum. Their findings suggest that there are two barriers to diffusion in frog skin epithelium, with the first barrier being at the stratum corneum and the second at the stratum granulosum.
