tldr: This article investigates the anisotropy and order-dependence of the Frank constants in nematic liquid crystals using a continuum theory. The study reveals that the 'bend' constant is at least twice the 'twist' constant, and the'splay' constant usually lies between the other two. The findings provide insights into the intermolecular interactions responsible for nematic alignment.
