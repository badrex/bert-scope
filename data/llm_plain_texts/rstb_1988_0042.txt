tldr: 'The article discusses the extensive recombination events in higher plant mitochondrial DNAs, focusing on the unusual mitochondrial open reading frame, wr/13-T, which encodes a 13 kDa polypeptide in the male-sterile T cytoplasm of maize. The author also examines the molecular events associated with mutations that lead to toxin-insensitivity and reversion to male fertility in maize. The study highlights the role of recombination and sequence duplication in the evolution of mitochondrial DNAs in higher plants.'
