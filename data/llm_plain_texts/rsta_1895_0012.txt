tldr: The author investigates the oscillations of a rotating ellipsoidal shell containing fluid, focusing on the effects of the fluid's motion on the shell. They find that the oscillations can be of two types: one type is similar to forced nutations of the Earth, while the other type is analogous to the motion of a rigid body. The study provides insight into the complex interactions between the Earth's interior and its surface, and the possible influence on latitude variations.
