tldr: This article explores the similarities between the visual orientation systems of insects and humans, specifically focusing on the fly Drosophila melanogaster. The study demonstrates that, like humans, flies can adapt to and manipulate visual flow field information for motor output systems not specifically designed for this type of sensory data. The findings suggest that the kind of visuo-motor coordination in insects may be universal in the animal kingdom.
