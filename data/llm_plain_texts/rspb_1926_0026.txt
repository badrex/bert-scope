tldr: The authors conducted a study on the effects of various substances on hemolysis, a process in which red blood cells break down. They discovered that certain substances, like serum, sodium hydroxide, and arginine, can inhibit hemolysis, while others, like histidine and aspartic acid, can accelerate it. The study provides insights into the complex interactions between different substances and their effects on red blood cells.
