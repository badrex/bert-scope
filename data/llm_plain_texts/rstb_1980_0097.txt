tldr: The article discusses the need for new antibiotics and explores the potential of genetic techniques to generate new antibiotics and increase the yields of existing ones. It highlights the importance of actinomycetes and fungi as primary sources of antibiotics and the potential of genetic methods, such as protoplast fusion and DNA cloning, to improve antibiotic production. The article also emphasizes the need for new antibiotics due to the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria and the limitations of existing antibiotics in treating diseases like tuberculosis and leprosy.
