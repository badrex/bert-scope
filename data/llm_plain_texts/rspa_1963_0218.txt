tldr: The authors studied the changes in ultra-violet absorption spectra of nitrates and nitrites as their temperature changed. They observed shifts in absorption bands during thermal transformations in the crystals, which provided insights into the interaction between nearest neighbors in the crystal structure. This research demonstrated the potential of ultra-violet absorption spectroscopy as a sensitive tool for studying thermodynamic effects in phase transformations.
