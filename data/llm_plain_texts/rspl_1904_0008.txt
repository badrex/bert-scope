tldr: The author examines the morphology of the retrocalcarine region of the cortex cerebri and its relationship to the calcarine sulcus. They demonstrate that the retrocalcarine sulcus is a crucial part of the visual cortex and is formed by the folding of the visual cortex itself. The study also reveals the variability of the retrocalcarine sulcus's form and constitution, suggesting that it is influenced by mechanical conditions during cortical expansion.
