tldr: The author investigates the mechanism behind the first sound of the heart and concludes that neither the closure of the auriculo-ventricular valves nor the muscular contraction of the heart walls is responsible for the first heart sound. Instead, the author suggests that the first sound is produced by the interaction between the heart's base and apex during systole.
