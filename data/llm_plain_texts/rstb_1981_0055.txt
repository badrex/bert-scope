tldr: This article discusses the evolution and efficiency of metabolic cycles in living organisms, focusing on the enzymes of glycolysis. The author explains that metabolic cycles have evolved to provide energy in a form that can be utilized by living cells, such as ATP. The optimal mechanism of acetate oxidation is that which gives the highest yield of ATP, and the citric acid cycle provides this advantage. The author suggests that it is always fruitful to examine the question of whether or why what has evolved in living organisms is optimally efficient, and that this may help in the understanding of biochemical and biological mechanisms.
