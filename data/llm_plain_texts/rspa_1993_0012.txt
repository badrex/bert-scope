tldr: The authors present a method for obtaining upper bounds on the critical probability in oriented bond percolation in two dimensions, improving the best published upper bound from 0.84 to 0.6863. They also prove that their method can be used to give arbitrarily good upper bounds and apply it to obtain an upper bound of 0.72599 for the critical probability in oriented site percolation.
