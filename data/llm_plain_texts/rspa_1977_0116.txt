tldr: This article provides a glossary for new particles and quantum numbers in gauge theories, explaining concepts such as quarks, color charge, and asymptotic freedom. It also discusses the role of gauge particles and the possibility of spontaneous symmetry breaking, which allows gauge particles to have non-zero mass while maintaining the finiteness of the theory. The article highlights the importance of understanding these concepts for the study of particle physics and the unification of fundamental forces.
