tldr: This article reports on experiments conducted by Captain F.W. Beechey on tides in the Irish Sea and the similarity of tidal phenomena in the Irish and English Channels. The study found that despite the variety of times of high water, the turn of the stream throughout the north and south Channels occurs at the same hour. The author also discusses the importance of extending these experiments to other areas and the benefits it would bring to navigation and science.
