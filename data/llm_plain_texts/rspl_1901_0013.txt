revised_title: The Solvent Action of Bile and Its Role in Fat Absorption and Excretion
semantic_tags:
  - Bile chemistry
  - Fat absorption
  - Bile salts
  - Solubility of soaps
  - Excretion
tldr: This article investigates the role of bile in the digestive system, focusing on its function as a solvent for fat absorption and excretion of insoluble substances like cholestearin and lecithin. The authors demonstrate that bile salts dissolve and increase the solubility of soaps and free fatty acids, aiding in fat absorption and facilitating the excretion of waste products from metabolism.
