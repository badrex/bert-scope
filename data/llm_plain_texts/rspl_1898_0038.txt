tldr: The authors conducted experiments using a capillary electrometer to study the electrical response of nerve to a single stimulus. They found that the electromotive changes in response to a single stimulus could be measured and recorded, providing data for determining the characteristics of the nerve's response. The experiments showed that the response was influenced by factors such as the distance between the electrometer contacts and the location of the stimulus.
