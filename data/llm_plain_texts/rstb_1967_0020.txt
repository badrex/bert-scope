tldr: The study investigates the growth and reproduction of the moss Polytrichum alpestre in South Georgia, a Sub-Antarctic island. The moss is found in various habitats and produces fruit regularly. The researchers discovered that while some turfs are unisexual and do not produce fruit, others are bisexual and can reproduce. The extensive banks of P. alpestre are made up of a mosaic of unisexual male, unisexual female, and bisexual areas, which may have developed through the coalescence of turfs as grasses like Poa flabellata were eliminated.
