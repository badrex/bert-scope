semantic_tags:
  - Hypernuclei
  - Particle physics
  - Quantum chromodynamics
  - Dibaryon
  - Double hypernuclei
tldr: The authors review the two double hypernucleus events published in the literature and discuss the existence of the predicted H-particle. They analyze the identified hypernuclei and their decay processes, and propose a hybrid emulsion experiment to improve knowledge of double hypernuclei.
