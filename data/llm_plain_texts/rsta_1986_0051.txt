tldr: The authors conducted a study on the importance of hydrogen bond formation in stabilizing the transition state of subtilisin, a serine protease. They found that mutations in the asparagine-155 residue, which forms a hydrogen bond with the substrate's carbonyl oxygen, significantly reduced the enzyme's activity. This research highlights the crucial role of hydrogen bonding in the catalytic mechanism of serine proteases.
