tldr: The author, Dr. George Garden, discusses the modern theory of generation and the role of animalcula in the reproduction process. He presents evidence that animalcula are found in semen and are responsible for the formation of new life. Garden also explains the importance of the female's ovary in the process and how it provides the necessary nutrients for the growth and development of the embryo.
