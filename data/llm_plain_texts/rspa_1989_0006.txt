tldr: The authors conducted polarized neutron diffraction experiments on deuterated ammonium vanadium(II) Tutton salt to study the spin density and metal-water bond. They found a substantial diffuse-like spin population and relatively large spin population on deuterium, indicating covalence in the water molecule's plane. The results confirm and extend earlier studies on these and related systems, providing insights into the bonding in transition metal complex ions.
