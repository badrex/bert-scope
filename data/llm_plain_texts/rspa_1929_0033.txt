tldr: The authors studied the ultra-violet spectrum of magnesium hydride, focusing on the band at 2430. They used a magnesium arc in hydrogen at low pressure to produce the spectrum and found that the band has an and -branch with the and branches being much stronger. The authors also observed a rapid decline in intensity in the and branches after passing the maximum value. The study provides insights into the molecular and atomic electronic energy levels of the MgIH molecule.
