tldr: This paper provides a survey of mathematical models and theories related to dynamic asset allocation in finance. It explains the concept of path independence and its relationship to efficient diversification through time, and discusses the implications of recent work on market equilibrium and performance measurement. The authors demonstrate how dynamic asset allocation strategies can be more efficient and less wasteful by following certain conditions and principles.
