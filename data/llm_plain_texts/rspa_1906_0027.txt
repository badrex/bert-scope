tldr: 'The authors investigated the relationship between the amount of water held by absorbent materials and the surrounding atmosphere's vapour pressure. They discovered that the hygrometric state (ratio of actual vapour pressure to maximum possible) determines the amount of water held by the material. This relationship is important for understanding moisture absorption and drying processes in materials like cotton and wool.'
