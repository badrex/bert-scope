tldr: This study conducted a quantitative survey of the biota of intertidal soft substrata on Aldabra Atoll in the Indian Ocean. Researchers collected samples from 24 stations representing various habitats and estimated densities, biomass, and productivity. The results showed that the main factors affecting species richness and biomass were plant cover, topographical complexity, and environmental conditions. The study provides valuable information on the structure and productivity of intertidal ecosystems in the region.
