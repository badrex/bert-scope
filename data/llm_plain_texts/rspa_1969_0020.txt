tldr: The authors studied the resistance of lead-copper-lead junctions in the superconducting state and discovered that they can support a supercurrent up to a critical value. They found that the sandwiches behave phenomenologically as phonon junctions and used a simplified version of the de Gennes theory to explain their behavior. The experiments showed that the coherence length of paired electrons in the copper increases as the temperature decreases, and the interaction parameter in copper lies between 0.5 and 1. The properties of these junctions are compared with those of junctions with insulating barriers.
