tldr: The author presents a case study of a congenitally blind patient who underwent eye surgery. The patient had double strabismus and cataract in both eyes. Despite multiple surgeries, the patient's vision remained limited. However, after the surgeries, the patient gained some sensation of light and could perceive colors of intense tones. The author concludes that the patient's belief in seeing objects was likely due to his imagination and reasoning abilities, combined with his refined sense of touch.
