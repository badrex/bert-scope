tldr: The study investigates the interaction between botulinum toxin and calcium in motor nerve terminals. It examines whether botulinum toxin blocks the process of calcium entry or acts at a later stage, preventing the utilization of calcium inside the terminal. The results show that the voltage-activated calcium current in the nerve endings is not significantly reduced by botulinum toxin, suggesting that the depression of transmitter release is caused by an intracellular site of the release mechanism.
