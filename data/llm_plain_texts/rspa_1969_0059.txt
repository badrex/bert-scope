tldr: This article investigates the behavior of an assembly of rigid, cohesionless particles and how the accompanying dilation affects the stress-dilatancy equation in triaxial tests. The author demonstrates that the fall-off in stress in the triaxial test arises from the destruction of anisotropy due to dilation, rather than the formation of slip lines.
