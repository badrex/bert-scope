tldr: The author extends Cardan's rule for resolving cubic equations, specifically for the case when the equation is not naturally fitted to solve it. By using Sir Isaac Newton's binomial theorem, the author derives a new expression to find the value of x in the second case of the equation, where the initial rule is not applicable.
