tldr: The author examines the structure in the secondary hydrogen spectrum through electron discharges in hydrogen and faint lines observed by Tanaka and themselves. They identify remarkable numerical properties in the lines and discuss the relationships between the lines, their terms, and quantum states. The study provides further evidence of structure in the hydrogen spectrum and contributes to the understanding of atomic physics.
