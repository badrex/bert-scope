tldr: This article investigates the effect of a nucleus spin on the optical spectra of atoms, focusing on the cases of nuclear spins of half a quantum and quanta. The author applies the method to bismuth, a practical application, and calculates the intensities of the components of the lines, finding results in fair agreement with experimental observations.
