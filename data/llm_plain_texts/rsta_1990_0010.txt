revised_title: 'Metal Alkoxides as Precursors for Thin-Film Growth in Molecular Chemistry'
semantic_tags:
  - Thin-film growth
  - Molecular chemistry
  - Metal alkoxides
  - MOCVD
  - Sol-gel process
tldr: The article discusses the use of metal alkoxides as precursors for depositing metal oxide films through the MOCVD and sol-gel techniques. Metal alkoxides are excellent precursors for synthesizing pure metal oxides, glasses, and ceramics, depending on their volatility and solubility. The article explores the factors controlling the volatility of metal alkoxides and the mechanisms of oxide deposition processes.
