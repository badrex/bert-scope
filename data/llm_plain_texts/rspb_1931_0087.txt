revised_title: 'The Role of Osmotic Pressure in Tracheal Air Extent in Terrestrial Insects'

tldr: The author investigates the extent of air in the tracheoles of terrestrial insects and how it is affected by osmotic pressure. They find that the air in tracheoles changes position based on the osmotic pressure of the tissue fluids, which remains constant even during fasting. This study provides insight into the respiratory system of insects and the role of tracheoles in supplying oxygen to their tissues.
