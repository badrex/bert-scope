tldr: This article presents a generalization of Hubbard's theory to study electron correlations in degenerate energy bands. The theory is based on the tight-binding approximation and focuses on the interactions of electrons on the same atom. The results show that the main effects of correlation phenomena are to give behavior characteristic of the atomic model, which can be described correctly in the limiting case of zero band-width. The theory is applicable to d- and f- bands of transition and rare earth metals and their alloys and salts.
