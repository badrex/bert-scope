revised_title: The Inevitability of Singularities in a Closed Universe
semantic_tags:
  - Cosmology

  - Closed Universe
  - Energy-Momentum Tensor
tldr: The authors prove that singularities are inevitable in a closed universe when certain conditions are met, such as the energy-momentum tensor satisfying a specific inequality. This finding is important for understanding the behavior of space-time and the evolution of the universe.
