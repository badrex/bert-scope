tldr: This study investigates the physiological properties of mouse haemoglobins and their potential role in natural selection. Researchers found that inbred strains of mice with different haemoglobin alleles have varying oxygen affinities, with Hbbd-tending mice having higher oxygen affinity. However, the exact cause of this variation remains unclear, and other factors may also play a role in determining the differential survival of different haemoglobin types under different environmental conditions.
