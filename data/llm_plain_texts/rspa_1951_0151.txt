tldr: The author presents a method for obtaining pointwise bounds for solutions of certain boundary-value problems, including the Dirichlet and Neumann problems. The method uses the hypercircle principle and Green's functions to locate the solution on a hypercircle in function space, providing bounds for the solution and its derivatives. This method is applicable to various boundary-value problems in three-dimensional regions.
