tldr: This article investigates the evaporation from large expanses of water, focusing on the distribution of water vapor in an air current moving over a uniform water surface. The authors employ an empirical formula to represent the rate of evaporation and consider the effect of air speed on the evaporation process. The study has implications for understanding evaporation in trade wind zones, inland seas, and lakes, and can help estimate the amount of water evaporated from a given area under different conditions.
