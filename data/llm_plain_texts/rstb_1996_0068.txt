tldr: This article compares the patterns and processes of speciation in Drosophila species on the Hawaiian and Caribbean islands. The Hawaiian system, with over 1000 species, is the most diverse and well-studied example of Drosophila evolution. The study reveals that colonization events and shifts in mate recognition systems play a significant role in the speciation process. The founder effect speciation models, which propose genetic restructuring during the initial stages of colonization, are discussed in the context of these island systems. The article highlights the importance of understanding the geological history and colonization events for studying speciation patterns in island systems.
