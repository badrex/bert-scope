tldr: This article discusses the theoretical status of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), a theory that describes the strong nuclear force between quarks and the fundamental particles called hadrons. The author reviews the motivation for QCD, its qualitative successes, and potential problems, such as the axial anomaly and the need for regularization schemes. The article also explores quantitative investigations of QCD, including short-distance physics, long-range properties, and the possibility of quark confinement.
