tldr: This article explores the use of tensor calculus in the development of general dynamical theory. It presents the geometry of dynamics in a semi-geometrical aspect, emphasizing the importance of geometrical intuition and visualization in understanding multidimensional spaces. The author discusses various types of dynamical manifolds, line-elements, and their properties, and highlights the potential of tensor calculus in applied mathematics and physics.
