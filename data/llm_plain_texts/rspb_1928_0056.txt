tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the smut fungi, focusing on the permanence and segregation of cultural characters. They found evidence suggesting that these characters are inherited in a Mendelian fashion and that the cytoplasm has no determining influence on them. The study also showed that segregation of these characters can occur in either of the reduction divisions.
