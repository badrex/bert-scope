tldr: The author explores static solutions of certain classical field equations in general relativity, focusing on the combination of electromagnetic, gravitational, and Dirac fields. They discover that under specific static conditions, the Weyl-Majumdar condition follows from the Dirac equations alone, and the whole set of field equations reduces to one nonlinear equation. This class of static solutions is the only possible one that can be constructed from coupled Maxwell-Einstein-Dirac field equations.
