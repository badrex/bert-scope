tldr: The author presents a theoretical analysis of finitely deforming face-centered cubic (f.c.c.) crystals in the sixfold symmetry position. They investigate the behavior of these crystals using the'simple theory' of finite-distortional latent hardening and Taylor's classical isotropic hardening rule. The study shows that both theories encompass the basic empirical evidence of deformation and latent hardening in the sixfold position, but neither theory uniquely requires the typically observed behavior. The author suggests a quasi-energetic postulate that can help select the expected mode of deformation from the otherwise admissible solutions.
