tldr: Dr. John Davy studied the air found in the pleura of a patient with pneumatothorax and conducted experiments to understand the absorption of different types of air in the pleura. He discovered that the air in the lungs was composed of 8% carbonic acid and 92% azotic gas. The author also found that the pleura could absorb one type of gas more than another, and he conducted further experiments with hydrogen, nitrous oxide, and nitrous gas to understand this phenomenon. He suggested that the appearance of air in the pleura in this case is due to secretion.
