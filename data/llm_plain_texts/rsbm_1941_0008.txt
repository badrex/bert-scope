tldr: John Henry Michell was a talented mathematician and scientist from Australia who made significant contributions to the fields of fluid dynamics and elasticity. He studied at the University of Melbourne and Trinity College at Cambridge, where he earned a major scholarship and became a senior-wrangler. Michell later became a lecturer in mathematics at Melbourne University and published numerous papers on theoretical hydrodynamics and elasticity. His work on wave resistance of ships, although initially overlooked, was later recognized as important in ship design. Despite facing personal challenges and a lack of recognition during his lifetime, Michell's contributions to mathematics and science continue to be appreciated today.
