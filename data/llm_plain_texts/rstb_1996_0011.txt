tldr: The article discusses the biological actions and signal transduction of inflammatory cytokines interleukin 1 (IL1) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF). These cytokines have a broad range of physiological effects, including inducing gene expression, activating protein kinases, and modulating cellular processes. The article focuses on the activation of different types of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases and their significance in various biological responses.
