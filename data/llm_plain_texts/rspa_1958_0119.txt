tldr: This article discusses the initiation and growth of explosions in solids, specifically focusing on the explosion of silver azide in an electric field. The authors found that the breakdown is due to field emission from the cathode, and that electrons may enter the crystal with enough energy to cause decomposition, followed by self-heating and explosion.
