tldr: The authors conducted experiments using an air-pump to study the effects of vacuum on various animals, including insects, birds, and mammals. They observed that animals' lungs collapse in a vacuum and that the lungs of dead animals sink in water. The authors discuss the possible reasons for these observations and the implications for understanding respiration and lung function.
