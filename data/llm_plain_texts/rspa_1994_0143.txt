tldr: This article presents an analysis of the sliding window decorrelation algorithm (SLWA) in direct sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) mobile radio systems. The authors develop a mathematical model for a multi-user CDMA system incorporating a sliding window decorrelator and investigate performance under practical limitations. They also discuss decorrelation in mobile radio channels and present results from a simulation model, demonstrating the effectiveness of the SLWA in overcoming the near-far problem in multipath fading environments.
