tldr: The authors isolated and quantitatively fractionated the surface lipid from the leaves of Brassica oleracea. They found that immersion of the leaves in ether for four or five 10-second periods provided an uncontaminated and representative sample of the surface lipid. The lipid was then analyzed using film chromatography, revealing ten distinct fractions. The study provides insight into the chemical composition of the surface lipid of cabbage leaves and the extraction techniques used for obtaining a representative sample.
