tldr: The author examines the structure and function of the fovea centralis, a specialized region in the human retina responsible for sharp central vision. They describe the unique arrangement of cone and rod cells, the role of optic nerve fibers, and the varying sensitivity of the retina at different locations. The study provides insights into the mechanisms of vision and the potential for further research on the retina's structure and function.
