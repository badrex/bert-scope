tldr: The author, J. P. Gassiot, conducted experiments with voltaic batteries in carbonic acid vacua and observed the luminous discharge patterns. The experiments were performed using various vacuum tubes and batteries, including a water battery of 3520 cells, a 512 series of Daniell's constant battery, and a 400 series of Grove's nitric acid battery. The author discovered that the discharge from the water battery was continuous and could pass through the vacuum tubes, while the discharge from the other batteries was not as effective. The study also examined the effects of length and insulation on the discharge of electrical cables.
