tldr: The authors studied the development of hair cells in neuromasts of the lateral line system in teleost fish. They discovered that new hair cells are mainly produced in pairs, with the two cells having opposite but parallel orientations of their mechanosensitive axes. This suggests that the axis of mitosis plays a role in determining the direction of the hair cell's axis of mechanosensitivity.
