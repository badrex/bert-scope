tldr: Sir Robert Abbott Hadfield's discovery of manganese steel in 1882 marked a significant milestone in metallurgical history. By adding manganese and silicon to steel, Hadfield created a revolutionary material that was extremely tough and could be hardened through heat treatment. This breakthrough led to the development of alloy steels and had a profound impact on the steel industry.
