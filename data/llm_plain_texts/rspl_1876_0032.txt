tldr: This paper presents the findings of the fifteenth and final contribution to the series "Contributions to Terrestrial Magnetism." It discusses the magnetic survey of four zones, from the equator to 40Â°S latitude, and introduces corrections for secular changes in the observations. The paper focuses on the middle and equatorial regions of the globe, where magnetic relations are simpler and the lines representing them can be aided by adjacent polar maps.
