tldr: The author examines the brains of a Bushwoman, two European idiots, and Apes to understand the differences in brain weights and structures. The study reveals that the brains of the Bushwoman and the European idiots have a simpler structure compared to European brains, indicating that the differences in brain development are due to race and not idiocy. The author also observes that the cerebellum is more developed than the cerebrum in all the subjects, and the commissural fibers of the corpus callosum are less developed in the idiots' brains.
