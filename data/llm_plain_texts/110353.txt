tldr: The author discusses the remains of a recent volcano in the Mediterranean and the composition of gases found near the site. Chemical tests reveal that the gas consists of oxygen and azotic gases. The author suggests that this gas may be released from sea water in contact with hot volcanic materials rather than directly from the volcano itself.
