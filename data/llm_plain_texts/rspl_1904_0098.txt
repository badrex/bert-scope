tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the action of human blood fluids on the Staphylococcus pyogenes bacteria and the development of protective elements in the human body after staphylococcus vaccine inoculation. They discovered that successful immunization against staphylococcus is associated with increased phagocytic power, which is dependent on the presence of opsonic elements in the blood. This increased phagocytic power helps the body fight off staphylococcus infections.
