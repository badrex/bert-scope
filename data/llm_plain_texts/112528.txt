tldr: This paper by W.J. Macquorn Rankine explores the velocity of advance of waves in liquids, demonstrating a law that applies to waves transmitting disturbances in a liquid with a uniform pressure surface. The author also discusses the concept of virtual depth and its relation to wave behavior, as well as the possibility of oblique tidal waves.
