tldr: Carolo Rinaldini conducted experiments to compare ice made without air to ice made with air. He found that ice made without air was opaque and whitish, similar to hail, while ice made with air was transparent like crystal. Rinaldini also discovered that ice made without air was heavier than ice made in the open air. This finding challenges the idea that ice made in the open air is produced by the extrusion of air within water.
