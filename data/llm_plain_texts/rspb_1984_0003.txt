tldr: The authors conducted experiments with intact, isolated chloroplasts to study the relationship between chlorophyll a fluorescence and the onset of photosynthetic carbon assimilation. They discovered that a'shoulder' in the fluorescence kinetics is associated with the exponential increase in the rate of carbon dioxide-dependent oxygen evolution. The length of this induction period was influenced by various factors, such as storage, temperature, and the presence of certain metabolites.
