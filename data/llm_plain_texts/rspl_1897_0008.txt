tldr: The author, Oliver Lodge, conducted a series of experiments to determine if there was any mechanical connection between ether and matter. By using rotating disks and a beam of light, he found that the velocity of light was not affected by the movement of matter, suggesting that any motion between ether and matter must be irrotational in nature.
