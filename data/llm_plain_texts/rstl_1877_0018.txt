tldr: The author conducted further experiments on the locomotor system of Medusae, focusing on the effects of excising the margins and lithocysts of nectocalyces and gonocalyces. The study aimed to understand the physiology and anatomy of these organisms, with a particular focus on the contractile zones and the role of lithocysts in their movements. The author also compared and contrasted their findings with those of Dr. Eimer, a fellow researcher in the field.
