tldr: 'This study investigates the chemotactic phenomena and fertilization process in the Fucaceae, a group of brown algae. The researchers found that ripe eggs of these algae exert a strong attraction on sperms, which helps in the fertilization process. They also discovered that cell-free preparations of Fucus serratus and F. vesiculosus eggs have a chemotactic attraction on sperms of related species. The chemotactic principle is a simple compound that can be expelled from aqueous solution and recovered using a cooled receiver.'
