tldr: This article discusses the use of surface extended X-ray absorption fine structure (SE-XAFS) in determining inter-atomic spacings and structures for adsorbates on surfaces. The authors review recent work on surface iodide structures and disordered structures, and demonstrate the ability of SE-XAFS to provide unambiguous structure determination from both poorly ordered and disordered structures.
