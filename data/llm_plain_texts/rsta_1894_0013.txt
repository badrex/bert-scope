tldr: This article presents a comprehensive analysis of various theories on the reflection and refraction of light, including the electromagnetic theory, elastic solid theory, and contractile ether theory. The author compares and contrasts these theories, ultimately providing expressions for the intensities and phases of reflected and refracted light, which agree well with experimental results.
