tldr: The authors studied ion density profiles in expanded shock tube flows using incident shock waves in argon and air. They found that the rate of ionization and the ion density levels were influenced by a multi-step process involving impurity ionization. The results also provided evidence for vibrational equilibration during the expansion process. This research contributes to understanding the ionization mechanisms at high temperatures.
