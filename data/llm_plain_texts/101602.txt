tldr: M. Hugens de Zulechem and Mr. Hook confirm the present appearance of Saturn's ring through their separate observations. De Zulechem writes from the Hague, while Hook observes the same phenomenon in London. The text also mentions a recent anatomical engagement by a learned anatomist, promising to provide a complete doctrine of respiration using geometrical principles.
