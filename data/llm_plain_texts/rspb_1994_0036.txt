tldr: The authors studied the reactions of Escherichia coli flavohaemoglobin (Hmp) with oxygen and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). They found that Hmp acts as an oxygen sensor by binding with intracellular oxygen, limiting flavin reduction in the aerobic steady state. When oxygen concentration decreases, the oxy species dissociates, and flavin reduction is sustained. This mechanism could control flavin-mediated iron (III) reduction required for activating the anaerobic gene regulator, Fnr.
