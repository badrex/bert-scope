tldr: 'The author, James Parsons, presents a short account of his book "A Mechanical Critical Inquiry into the Nature of Hermaphrodites." He discusses the historical propagation of the belief in the existence of hermaphrodites and critiques the causes and arguments assigned for their production. Parsons also provides a critical view of the histories of hermaphrodites given by various authors and concludes that the error of their existence is confuted.'
