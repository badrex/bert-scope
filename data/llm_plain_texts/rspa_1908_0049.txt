tldr: This article investigates the magnetic properties of iron alloys, specifically Stalloy and Lohys, when subjected to very small magnetic forces. The authors study hysteresis loss, permeability, and eddy current loss in these materials, finding that Stalloy has a high permeability for small magnetic inductions but rapidly diminishes as the induction increases. The hysteresis loss for both materials lies about midway between the values of very pure iron and transformer plate rolled from Swedish iron.
