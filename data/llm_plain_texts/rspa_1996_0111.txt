revised_title: 'Criterion for Thermal Explosion with Reactant Consumption in a Dusty Gas: A New Asymptotic Approach'
semantic_tags:
  - Thermal explosion
  - Dusty gas
  - Asymptotic methods
  - Critical trajectory
  - Reactant consumption
tldr: The authors investigate the thermal explosion problem in a dusty gas, considering reactant consumption and interphase heat exchange. They propose a new asymptotic criterion for thermal explosion, based on the critical trajectory, which separates explosive and non-explosive regimes. This criterion is particularly useful for highly exothermic systems.
