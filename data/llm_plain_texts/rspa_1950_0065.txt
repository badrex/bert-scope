tldr: The authors conducted experiments using a proportional counter and absorbing foils to study the inelastic scattering of protons by magnesium, aluminium, and other light elements. They discovered energy groups corresponding to specific nuclear levels and observed that inelastic scattering is predominantly a process involving the formation of a compound nucleus. This research provides valuable information about nuclear energy levels and helps to understand the scattering process.
