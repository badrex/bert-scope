tldr: The authors conducted experiments using a rotating-cylinder viscometer to study the stability of flow between rotating cylinders. They found that the transition past instability is reversible, meaning the critical speed for the flow to transition from laminar to cellular flow is the same when approached from above or below. This result was observed in both hydrodynamic and hydromagnetic flow, as well as in spiral flow between rotating cylinders.
