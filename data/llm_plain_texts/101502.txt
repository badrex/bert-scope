tldr: Mr. Hook observed the planet Jupiter and its moons from London. He noticed the varying degrees of light on its surface and the presence of dark belts and zones. He also observed the movement of spots within these belts. Additionally, he noted the visibility of Jupiter's four satellites through a telescope and compared their brightness to the planet itself. These observations provided valuable information about the planet's atmosphere and its moons.
