tldr: This article describes an experiment conducted in the southern hemisphere that measures ultra-violet radiation from celestial objects using a Skylark vertical sounding rocket. The rocket carried multiple ultra-violet photometers that scanned the sky, allowing the researchers to identify signals from stars and the Moon. The experiment provided valuable data for understanding the energy balance in stars and the lunar albedo.
