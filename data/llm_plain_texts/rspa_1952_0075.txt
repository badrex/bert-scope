tldr: The authors investigated the scattering of slow neutrons by crystals, focusing on nickel and magnesium. They expanded on Weinstock's theory by considering multi-oscillator processes, where the neutron exchanges more than one phonon with the crystal lattice. The results showed that the calculated cross-sections for these processes agreed with experimental data within 4%, providing a more accurate understanding of neutron scattering in crystals.
