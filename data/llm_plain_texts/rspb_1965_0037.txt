tldr: The article investigates the initiation phase of natural leukemogenesis in humans using a mathematical model. It explores the role of genetic factors, mutation frequencies in germ cells, and chromosomal defects in the development of leukemia. The study also discusses the association between different types of leukemia and other malignancies within families, as well as the influence of age and birth rank on leukemia incidence.
