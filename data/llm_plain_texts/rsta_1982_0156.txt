tldr: This article discusses the remarkable progress made in the cluster chemistry of early transition elements, focusing on halide and chalcogenide clusters of Nb, Ta, Mo, and other elements. The author highlights the synthesis, structure, and properties of novel halide clusters, with a major emphasis on new ternary and quaternary molybdenum oxides prepared at high temperatures. These solid-state materials include discrete cluster arrays and structures with extended metal-metal bonding.
