tldr: The authors investigate the transport of compact particles through solutions of chain-polymers, focusing on the empirical equation relating the relative retardation of sedimentation to the particle's radius and the concentration of the polymer. They propose a stochastic model that predicts the form of the equation and provides a reasonable value for the numerical constant, supported by experimental data on sedimentation, diffusion, and partition of macromolecules.
