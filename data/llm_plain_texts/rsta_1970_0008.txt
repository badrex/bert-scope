tldr: This article explores the properties of varieties of metabelian groups and split-groups, which are universal algebras closely related to groups. The author focuses on the classification of certain metabelian varieties of finite exponent and provides a description of the lattice of subvarieties for specific cases. The study of these varieties can help shed light on the nature of metabelian groups and their properties.
