tldr: The authors conducted a study to understand the excretion of cholesterol in humans when fed on various diets. They found that cholesterol excretion can be accounted for by the amount taken in with food, provided the body weight remains constant. However, when there is a rapid loss in weight, such as during illness, the output of cholesterol exceeds the intake. This study highlights the importance of maintaining a balanced diet and stable body weight for proper cholesterol management.
