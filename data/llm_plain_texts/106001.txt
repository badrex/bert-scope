tldr: In 1768, Ensign George Sproule observed the immersions and emersions of Jupiter's satellites using a reflecting telescope and a pendulum time-piece. He made these observations at the South Point of the Entrance of Gaspee Bason, and recorded the times and positions of the satellites' appearances and disappearances. Sproule's observations were essential for understanding the behavior of Jupiter's satellites and refining the accuracy of astronomical measurements.
