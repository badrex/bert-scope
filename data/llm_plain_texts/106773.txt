tldr: In this article, William Herschel discusses his observations of Saturn's rings and their rotation. He discovers that the rings are actually two separate rings, each with its own rotation period. He also examines the black divisions within the rings and their impact on the planet's shadow. Herschel's findings improve our understanding of Saturn's rings and their behavior, paving the way for further research in planetary science.
