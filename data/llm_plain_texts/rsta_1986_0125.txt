tldr: The authors present a formal framework and mathematical tools to investigate the Bonnor-Thorne approach to gravitational radiation theory. They construct the general radiative solution of the Einstein vacuum equations in harmonic coordinates, exploring its structure in the near and far zones. This work addresses three main problems in gravitational radiation theory, focusing on the asymptotic behavior, generation, and radiation reaction of radiative gravitational fields.
