tldr: The author, Arthur Cayley, explores the symmetric functions of roots in systems of two equations, specifically focusing on linear and ternary equations. He explains a process to determine the symmetric functions of these systems and applies it to two particular cases: a linear equation and a quadratic equation, and a linear equation and a cubic equation.
