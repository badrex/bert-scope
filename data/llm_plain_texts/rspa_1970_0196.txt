tldr: The article describes the design and construction of a selective chopper radiometer to be flown on the Nimbus satellite in 1970. The radiometer uses selective absorption and selective chopping techniques to monitor atmospheric temperature from satellites, enabling the observation of radiation from different altitudes. The six-channel radiometer covers a range of heights between the ground and 50 km, with the goal of achieving accurate temperature measurements and improving our understanding of the Earth's atmosphere.
