tldr: The authors conducted experiments on rabbits to study the survival of corneal homografts, which are transplanted corneas from another person. They discovered that corneal homografts can provoke an immunity reaction when transplanted to positions typically occupied by skin, suggesting that corneal tissue is antigenically effective. This finding challenges the idea that corneal homografts are in a privileged position and cannot elicit an immunity reaction.
