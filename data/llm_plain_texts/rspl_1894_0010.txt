tldr: The author conducted experiments to measure and manipulate intracranial pressure in animals, specifically cats and dogs. They discovered that the normal intracranial pressure is low and that increasing pressure can cause various physiological effects, such as changes in respiration, blood pressure, and pupil dilation. The study also found that the brain can compensate for some reduction in cranial capacity but that excessive pressure can lead to severe consequences. The research provides valuable insights into the relationship between intracranial pressure and brain function.
