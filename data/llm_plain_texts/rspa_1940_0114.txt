tldr: The article investigates the motion of two charged particles under specific hypotheses, such as considering them as mathematical points and using the relativistic equations of motion based on the Lorentz ponderomotive force. The author develops a method of successive approximations to find the energy and angular momentum rates of change, leading to a better understanding of the electromagnetic two-body problem.
