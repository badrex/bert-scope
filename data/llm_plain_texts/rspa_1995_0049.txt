tldr: The authors conducted time-dependent two-dimensional numerical simulations to study the evolution of a high-speed compressible mixing layer between hydrogen and oxygen gas streams. They identified three distinct mixing regimes: laminar, convective-mixing, and diffusive-mixing. The study examined the effects of viscosity, molecular diffusion, and compressibility on the mixing process and provided insights into the growth and decay of the mixing layer.
