tldr: The authors conducted dynamical diffraction calculations for reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) from molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growing surfaces. They investigated the effects of diffraction and growth conditions on RHEED intensity oscillations during growth on a low-index surface. The results were compared with the kinematic diffraction theory and shown to reproduce almost all features of measured RHEED intensity oscillations from low-index surfaces.
