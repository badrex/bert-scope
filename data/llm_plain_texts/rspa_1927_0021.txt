tldr: The authors conducted experiments using an Eötvös torsion balance to compare the mass-weight ratios of different substances, including ammonium fluoride, paraffin wax, and brass. They found that the mass-weight ratios of helium and hydrogen do not differ by more than one part in 3 x 10^6, and they were unable to detect any anomalous effects with bismuth. This research helps to understand the relationship between mass and weight in various substances.
