tldr: 'This article presents a supplementary list of nuclear DNA amounts in angiosperms, providing information on the variation in DNA values and its significance in plant evolution, phenotypes, and adaptation. The authors discuss the practical applications of understanding DNA amounts, such as in molecular studies, gene libraries, and plant species survival in challenging environments.'
