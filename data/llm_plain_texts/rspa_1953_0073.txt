tldr: This article describes measurements of the thermionic constants of monovalent metals, such as copper, silver, and gold, using the effusion method. The experiments reveal that the coefficient in Richardson's equation for thermionic emission is close to the theoretical value of 120 ampere for these metals. The study is of special interest due to the metals' low melting points and their high electronic vapor pressures in the range of temperatures studied.
