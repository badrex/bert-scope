tldr: The authors study the elastic and dielectric properties of crystals with polarizable atoms, expanding the equations of motion for the normal modes of vibration using the dipole approximation. They obtain expressions for the elastic and dielectric constants and infra-red absorption frequencies of non-pyroelectric crystals, focusing on diagonally cubic crystals like sodium chloride, cesium chloride, and zinc blende structures. The theory provides satisfactory agreement with experimental results for germanium and sodium iodide.
