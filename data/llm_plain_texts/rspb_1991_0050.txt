tldr: The study examines the properties of calcium-dependent potassium channels in smooth muscle cells from normal and atherosclerotic human aortas. It discovers two kinetically different types of channels in atherosclerotic aortas, with shorter open times and lower calcium sensitivity, which resemble channels found in fetal human aortas. These findings suggest that changes in electrophysiological properties may occur during atherosclerosis development.
