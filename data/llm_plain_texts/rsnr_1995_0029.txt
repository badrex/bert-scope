tldr: This article examines the differences between literary and scientific styles by comparing the letters and articles of physicist Max Born. It explores the question of whether a scientist's scientific prose is different from their literary prose and uses statistical analysis to determine the probability that the sentence-lengths in scientific and literary texts come from the same distribution. The study finds that the probability is very low, indicating that scientific and literary texts have distinct writing styles.
