tldr: The author investigates the distribution of cytoplasmic organs, such as the Golgi apparatus and mitochondria, in transplantable tumor cells. They find that these organs often have an irregular distribution and do not follow the centrosome during cell division. The behavior of these organelles during mitosis varies depending on their distribution in the resting cell. This research provides insights into the characteristics of tumor cells and their similarities to embryonic cells.
