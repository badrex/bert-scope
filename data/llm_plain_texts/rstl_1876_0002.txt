tldr: 'John Tyndall's experiments demonstrate that the floating matter in the atmosphere, which causes the scattering of light, is also responsible for the process of putrefaction and infection. By filtering the air and removing the floating matter, he shows that the remaining optically pure air has no power to generate life or cause putrefaction. This discovery has implications for understanding the spread of disease and the development of antiseptic and disinfecting methods.'
