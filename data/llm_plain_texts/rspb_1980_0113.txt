tldr: Researchers have developed a method to visualize and identify satellite cells in living frog muscle fibers using light microscopy. They found that satellite cells appear as elongated, fusiform cells with long fine processes, usually parallel to the muscle fiber axis. The study also investigated the possibility of connections between satellite cells and muscle fibers by observing the transfer of horseradish peroxidase. The findings contribute to understanding muscle growth and regeneration.
