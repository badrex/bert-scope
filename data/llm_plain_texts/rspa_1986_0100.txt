tldr: The authors studied the elastic behavior of orthorhombic sulphur under pressure by measuring the effects of hydrostatic and uniaxial pressures on ultrasonic wave velocities. They determined the hydrostatic pressure derivatives of 19 second-order elastic constants and 19 of the 20 third-order elastic constants. The results provide insight into the nature of binding forces between atoms in the crystal and help understand the vibrational anharmonicity of the long-wavelength acoustic modes.
