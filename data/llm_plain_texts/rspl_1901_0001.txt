tldr: The author and their collaborators studied homotyposis, the principle of likeness and diversity among undifferentiated organs or structures within an individual, in various plant species. They found that homotypic correlation is a fundamental factor in heredity and variation, and that it is present in both plants and animals. The results suggest that homotyposis and variation are primary factors in the growth of all living forms, rather than being the product of natural selection.
