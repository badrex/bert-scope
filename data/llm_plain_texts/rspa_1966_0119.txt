tldr: The authors conducted a crystallography study of a unique arene-rhodium complex, -hexakis(trifluoromethyl)benzene rhodium. They discovered a novel form of bonding for the benzene ligand and the -cyclopentadienyl anion to the rhodium, which is asymmetric and related to similar molecules. The study provides insights into the electronic structure and bonding of the complex, contributing to the understanding of arene-transition metal complexes.
