tldr: The authors study the northern margin of the Limpopo orogenic belt in southern Africa, identifying it as a large-scale ductile shear zone with up to 200 km of right-lateral displacement. They analyze the structure and deformation history of the area, providing insights into the evolution of the Precambrian crust and the movement of tectonic plates in the region.
