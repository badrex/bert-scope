tldr: 'The authors develop a statistical mechanics approach to study regular solutions, a type of solution in which the interactions between different molecules are considered to be "regular" or "normal." They discuss the assumptions and mathematical formulations involved in this approach, and explore the behavior of regular solutions in terms of temperature, pressure, and molecular composition. The authors also consider the effects of molecular size and solvation on the thermodynamic properties of regular solutions.'
