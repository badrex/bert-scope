tldr: This study presents a diffusion-competition model to understand the interaction between grey and red squirrels in Britain. The model predicts waves of grey squirrel invasion, similar to observed field data. Competition between the two species slows the speed of the invading grey squirrels. The research suggests that grey squirrels have a competitive advantage in deciduous woodlands, leading to the displacement of red squirrels in these habitats.
