tldr: The author investigates the muscular movements caused by the action of a galvanic current on nerve, focusing on the work of Dr. Rousseau and Professor Claude Bernard. They find that the order of contractions is altered by changes in the arrangement of the nerve and the strength of the current. The author also discovers alternating movements that have not been described before, which can be explained using Dr. Rousseau's key method.
