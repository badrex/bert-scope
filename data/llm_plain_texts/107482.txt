tldr: The author, John Pond, conducted observations of the star a Aquilae using a new transit instrument to determine if there was any parallax. After analyzing the data, he concluded that the parallax of the star was either an insensible quantity or extremely small, and could not be the cause of the discordances observed by Dr. Brinkley.
