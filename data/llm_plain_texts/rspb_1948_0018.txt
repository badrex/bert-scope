tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the passage of antibodies from the maternal circulation into rabbit embryos. They found that antibodies can pass freely from the mother to the embryo during early stages of pregnancy, through the yolk-sac wall. This discovery challenges the idea that the yolk-sac wall is selective in allowing proteins to pass through. The findings have implications for understanding placental permeability and maternal-fetal transmission of antibodies.
