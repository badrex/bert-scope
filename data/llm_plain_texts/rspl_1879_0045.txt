tldr: The author conducted experiments on the influence of colloids on crystalline form and observed movements in mixtures of colloids with crystalloids. They discovered that cholesterin, when mixed with egg albumen, forms spherical shapes that transform into crystalline structures. The addition of acetic acid and glycerin to the mixture results in various transformations and movements, demonstrating the balance between heat and crystallization. This study provides insights into the behavior of colloids and crystalloids and their interactions.
