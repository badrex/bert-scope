tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the rate of emission of beta-ray energy by radium B and C, and thorium B and C. They used ionization chambers to measure the ionization produced by the beta radiation in various media. The results showed that the rate of emission of beta-ray energy by radium B and C, and thorium B and C, was consistent with the distance from the source.
