tldr: In 1751, W. Watson reported on electrical experiments conducted in England to extract electricity from thunder-clouds, following Benjamin Franklin's hypothesis. Despite the lack of suitable weather conditions, Watson shared an account of his successful experiment and those of other members of the Royal Society, verifying Franklin's hypothesis. This contributed to the authenticity of similar experiments conducted in Paris and Berlin.
