tldr: This study investigates the effects of external pressure on the uptake of bromine in graphite. The researchers found that increasing pressure reduces the rate of bromine uptake and that the limiting uptake is influenced by the applied pressure. The findings provide valuable information about the internal constraints in graphite and the formation of intercalation compounds.
