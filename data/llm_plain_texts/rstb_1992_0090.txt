tldr: 'Luminescence dating, including thermoluminescence and optically stimulated luminescence, has provided crucial evidence for the presence of anatomically modern humans in western Asia earlier than previously thought. This dating technique has also confirmed palaeoenvironmental indications that the Mousterian industry in Europe was present somewhat earlier than the 100 ka limit previously accepted. Burnt flint and unburnt sediment have been important materials in Palaeolithic dating, with unburnt sediment offering a vast extension of luminescence dating on Palaeolithic sites.'
