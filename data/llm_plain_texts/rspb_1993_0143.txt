tldr: The study investigates the female multiple mating behavior in the common shrew as a strategy to reduce inbreeding. The authors found that in high-density populations, many successful copulations took place between close relatives, leading to lower offspring survival rates. The high incidence of multiple paternity in the studied population supports the hypothesis that female multiple mating is a strategy to reduce inbreeding, as it helps to decrease the risk of all offspring being sired by a close relative.
