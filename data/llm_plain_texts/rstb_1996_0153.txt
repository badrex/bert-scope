tldr: The authors develop a case model to study the persistence mechanisms in the interaction between the butterfly Maculinea rebeli and its specialist parasitoid Ichneumon eumerus. They explore how parasitoid searching intensity, behavior, and host refuges affect the dynamics of the parasitoid-host relationship. The study highlights the importance of heterogeneity in vulnerability and intraspecific competition within ant nests in the persistence of both host and parasitoid populations.
