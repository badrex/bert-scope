tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the currents induced in a conductor by the passage of a magnetic material, specifically an iron shell. They compared their experimental results with the mathematical predictions and found a good agreement. The study provides insights into the factors affecting the galvanometer deflection, such as the velocity, earth's field, and the magnetic material's properties.
