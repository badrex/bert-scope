tldr: 'The article discusses the processes of evolutionary change and cytogenetics in domesticated plants. It explains that the ultimate source of variation in crop plants is mutation, which is then exposed to selection, both natural and human. The direction of human selection can change through time and can usually be inferred from archaeological artifacts. The article also highlights the importance of understanding the genetic systems and gene flow in wild species to explain the responses of cultivated plants to domestication.'
