tldr: The authors conducted experiments on cows to study the precursors of milk fat and other milk constituents in their blood. They found that blood sugar, fatty acids, and inorganic phosphorus showed significant changes when passing through the mammary gland, suggesting that these components play a role in milk synthesis. The results provide insights into the origin of milk fat and other milk constituents, which can help improve our understanding of dairy production and nutrition.
