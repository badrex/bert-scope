tldr: The author investigates the role of pancreatic secretion in the absorption of fat in the alimentary canal. They found that pancreatic juice contains a fat-splitting enzyme and an alkaline substance that help break down and emulsify fat, allowing it to be absorbed through the intestinal walls. The study confirms the importance of pancreatic secretion in the digestion and absorption of dietary fats.
