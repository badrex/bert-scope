tldr: The article presents new solutions for adiabatic transverse waves in a Rankine vortex, showing that for each harmonic and a specified angular velocity of the core, there is an infinite spectrum of frequencies related to unstable waves. The study focuses on the unbounded vortex and provides solutions for different values of the parameters, revealing the existence of a spectrum of waves for the unbounded vortex.
