revised_title: 'The Mechanism and Rate of Spreading of Crystals and Lenses of Fats on the Surface of Water'

tldr: The authors study the behavior of crystals and lenses of fats on the surface of water, focusing on the mechanisms and rates of spreading. They discuss the processes of surface spreading and vapor spreading, and how they relate to the formation of unimolecular and multimolecular films. The authors also explore the factors that influence the formation of these films, such as surface activity, residual valency forces, and the specific adhesion between the adsorbent and adsorbate.
