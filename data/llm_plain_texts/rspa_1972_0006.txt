tldr: The authors investigate the interaction between gas phase reactions and catalytic oxidation in the conversion of benzene to maleic anhydride over vanadia-based catalysts. They find that gas phase reactions play a significant role in the process, and the kinetics of the reaction cannot be explained solely by gas-solid reactions. The study provides insights into the complex interactions between gas and gas-solid processes in catalytic reactions.
