tldr: The author, John Augustus Lloyd, conducted a survey across the Isthmus of Panama to determine the relative height of the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean. The survey involved leveling across the isthmus and analyzing the effects of tides. The findings showed that the Pacific Ocean is 13.55 feet higher than the Atlantic Ocean at mean tides. The author also discussed the geography and topography of the Isthmus, recommending the establishment of a rail-road and improvements to the Bay of Limon for better communication.
