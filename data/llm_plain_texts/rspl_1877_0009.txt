revised_title: 'Geological Influences on Earth's Axis and Continental Shifts'
semantic_tags:
  - Geology
  - Earth's axis
  - Continental drift
  - Earth's rotation
  - Ocean depth
tldr: The author explores the impact of geological forces on the Earth's axis and the movement of continents. Using mathematical calculations, he determines the original depth of the Earth's surface before geological changes and the effect of ocean excavations on the Earth's pole. He also calculates the displacement of the North Pole caused by each continent and discusses the hypothetical effects of imaginary continents occupying the sites of the present Pacific Ocean.
