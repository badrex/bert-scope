tldr: This article analyzes X-ray scattering data to study the charge distribution in body-centered cubic iron and chromium. The authors find that localized electron densities can be used to calculate the total charge density in the unit cell, and that the superposition of Hartree-Fock atoms on lattice sites must be adjusted to match the experimental results. The study provides insights into the electron distribution in transition metals and contributes to the understanding of their properties.
