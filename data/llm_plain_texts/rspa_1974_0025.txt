tldr: The article investigates the propagation and broadening of pulses in weakly irregular media, focusing on radio signals from pulsars. The diffraction approach to wave propagation in irregular media is used to analyze pulse shapes and compare them with the theory of pulse broadening based on geometrical optics. The study provides insights into the transition from single scattering to multiple scattering and the characteristics of pulse shapes in different scenarios.
