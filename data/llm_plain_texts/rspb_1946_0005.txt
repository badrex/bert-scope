tldr: This study confirms that the giant fibres in the earthworm play a role in the end-to-end shortening reaction. The research investigates the claim that the median giant fibre conducts impulses only from head to tail, and the lateral giants only in the reverse direction. The results show that each fibre conducts impulses in both directions and that the difference in their functions is related to their sensory distribution. The electrical records from the giant fibres provide insight into the reflex activity and the role of these fibres in the earthworm's nervous system.
