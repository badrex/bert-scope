tldr: The author, James Rennell, presents further observations on the westward current that often occurs near the Scilly Islands. He collects evidence from various instances, such as the Earl Cornwallis Indiaman and H.M.S. Russel, to confirm the current's course and strength. Rennell also discusses a current setting to the northeast across St. George's Channel, which can pose a threat to vessels passing between Land's End and Dublin.
