tldr: The article presents a theoretical model for particle condensation in evaporative flows. It combines kinetic models of evaporation and nucleation processes to understand industrial particle emissions and improve the design of manufacturing processes involving particle production or particle-free evaporation. The model considers factors such as pressure, source and sink temperatures, and flux density of heat or mass from the source to predict the conditions necessary for particle formation and the evolution of particle size distribution in the flow.
