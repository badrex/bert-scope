tldr: The study investigates the influence of experimentally induced agranularity on the synaptogenesis of serotonin nerve terminals in rat cerebellar cortex. The serotonin innervation undergoes significant changes in the absence of granule cells, with terminals forming more synaptic connections. This suggests that the cerebellar environment plays a crucial role in the formation of cerebellar connectivity.
