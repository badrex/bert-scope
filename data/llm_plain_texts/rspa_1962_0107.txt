tldr: The authors analyzed the A band system of nitrogen dioxide and found that the main transition in the 1650-1350A region is a Rydberg transition. They discovered that the upper state has a larger symmetrical stretching frequency and a smaller N-O length than the ground state, indicating a change in molecular dimensions from bent to linear. This study provides insights into the electronic transitions and molecular structure of nitrogen dioxide.
