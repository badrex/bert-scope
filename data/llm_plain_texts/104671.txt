tldr: This article describes a case where a tumor growing inside the bladder was successfully removed by Joseph Warner, a surgeon at Guy's Hospital. The patient, a 23-year-old woman, had been unable to urinate without the use of a catheter due to the tumor. Warner used a combination of ligatures and a small incision to remove the tumor, allowing the patient to urinate normally and recover fully.
