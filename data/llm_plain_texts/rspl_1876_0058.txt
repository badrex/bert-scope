tldr: The author conducted experiments on the connective tissue of the tongue in toads to study the changes that occur during inflammation. They observed the behavior of fixed elements in the tissue and found that they did not participate in the inflammatory process, contrary to previous beliefs. This research provided valuable insights into the understanding of inflammation and tissue changes.
