tldr: This article explores the behavior of atomic hydrogen in an electric field and its connection to the dielectric constant. The author investigates the quantum theory and its implications on the hydrogen atom's response to an electric field, comparing it to classical theory. The study provides insights into the atom's behavior and potential applications in understanding atomic structures and interactions.
