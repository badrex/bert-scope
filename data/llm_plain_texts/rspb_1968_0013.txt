revised_title: 'The Development and Origin of Liver Macrophages: Lymphocyte and Bone-Marrow Precursors'
semantic_tags:
  - Macrophage development
  - Lymphocyte origin
  - Bone-marrow precursor
  - Liver macrophages
  - Reticulo-endothelial stimulation
tldr: The authors studied the development of liver macrophages and found that they can be derived from two different precursors: lymphocytes and bone-marrow cells. The type of precursor depends on the nature of the reticulo-endothelial stimulus. This research provides insight into the origin and life-history of macrophages and their role in the immune system.
