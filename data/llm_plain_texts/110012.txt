tldr: The author, Henry Earle, examines the cervical vertebrae in birds, their varying numbers, and complex joints. He describes the structure of the joints, the canal of each vertebra, and the mechanisms that prevent compression of the spinal marrow during neck movements. He also highlights the correspondence between the extent of motion and the size and form of the canal in the human spine, as well as some pathological consequences related to this structure.
