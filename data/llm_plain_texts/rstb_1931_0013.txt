tldr: The authors conducted a study on the biochemistry of micro-organisms, specifically Aspergillus species, using a carbon balance sheet method. They examined various types of products formed from glucose by different species of Aspergillus and found that each group has distinct biochemical characteristics. The study helps in understanding the metabolism and growth of these fungi, which can be useful in various applications, including agriculture and medicine.
