tldr: The article presents a method for solving a class of dual integral equations that occur in diffraction problems. The author demonstrates that by constructing a set of functions of compact support biorthogonal to another given set of functions, these dual integral equations can be solved. This method is a complement to the Weiner-Hopf method and is applicable to various diffraction problems, including the diffraction of electromagnetic waves, sound waves, and elastic waves.
