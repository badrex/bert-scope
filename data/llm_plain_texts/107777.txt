tldr: The author, David Brewster, conducted experiments to study the reflection and decomposition of light at the separating surfaces of media. He discovered that the reflected light's color changes based on the refractive powers of the media, and the tint of the reflected light is different from the incident light. This phenomenon occurs due to the interaction of the incident light with the solid and fluid media.
