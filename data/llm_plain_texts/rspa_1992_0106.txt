tldr: The authors investigate the linear stability of a rotating, axisymmetric, self-gravitating fluid mass, focusing on short wavelength perturbations. They recover the Hoswaldand criterion for axisymmetric perturbations and find that it is also a sufficient condition for instability when non-axisymmetric perturbations are allowed. The spectrum of the linear stability problem is continuous and occupies a non-zero area in the complex spectral plane in the unstable case.
