tldr: 'The article investigates the folding pathway of staphylococcal nuclease using spectroscopic methods. The authors examine the sequential build-up of structure in the denatured state by manipulating the free energy distance between the native and denatured states. They find that a beta-meander and the second alpha helix are among the most stable local structures, and the last step in the folding pathway involves the formation and packing of the carboxy-terminal alpha helix to form the native state.'
