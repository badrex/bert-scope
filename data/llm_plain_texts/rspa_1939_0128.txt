tldr: The author presents a new method for solving the self-consistent field equations with exchange for carbon atoms. They calculate the wave functions for carbon's normal states and configurations, providing tables of these functions and energies. This method improves upon previous calculations by including exchange in the calculation of radial wave functions and energy formulas.
