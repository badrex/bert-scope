tldr: In 1781, Mr. Herschel observed a large and unusual star, which later turned out to be a comet. Using a micrometer and various magnifying powers, he measured the comet's diameter and position, and found that it was moving and approaching Earth. He also discussed the challenges and limitations of observing celestial objects and the importance of accurate measurements. His observations and analysis helped confirm the comet's identity and contributed to the understanding of comets during that time.
