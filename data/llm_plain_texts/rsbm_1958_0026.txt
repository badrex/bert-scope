tldr: Heinrich Wieland was a renowned organic and biochemist who made significant contributions to the fields of nitrogen compounds, bile acids, and steroids. His work on bile acids led to the discovery of new methods of degradation and helped establish the relationship between bile acids and steroids. Wieland's research on nitrogen compounds, including tetra-arylhydrazines and fulminic acid, expanded our understanding of these complex molecules. His dedication to his work earned him the Nobel Prize in 1927.
