  - Nervous System Arrangement
tldr: The author discusses the relationship between immiscibility and critical curves in various alloys, specifically focusing on the effects of different solvent metals and the arrangement of the sympathetic nervous system. The experiments reveal that the critical curves vary depending on the solvent metal and the immiscible metals used, with notable differences between silver, tin, cadmium, and antimony as solvents. The author also briefly touches on the arrangement of the sympathetic nervous system in cats.
