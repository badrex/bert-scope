tldr: Dr. S. Morris reports a rare case of a two-headed child born in Petworth, Sussex. The child had two well-shaped faces, two hearts, two lungs, and a double spine. The child's anatomy is described in detail, with comparisons to animal anatomy. This case study provides insight into the understanding of birth defects and monstrosities during the 17th century.
