tldr: This article examines the development of travelling waves in a simple isothermal chemical system with cubic autocatalysis, considering both quadratic and linear decay. The authors find that for the quadratic decay case, a wave will develop if a certain non-dimensional parameter is above a threshold, while for the linear decay case, wave initiation depends on another parameter and requires a minimum input threshold. The study also explores the behavior of the travelling wave solutions and their stability.
