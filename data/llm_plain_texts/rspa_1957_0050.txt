tldr: The article discusses a method for analyzing quantum-mechanical systems with collective motion, focusing on a general approach that considers sets of states rather than single states. The method is applied to various examples, including plasma oscillations of an electron gas, nuclear structure models, and meson-nucleon interaction problems. The author proposes a formula for the moment of inertia of a rotating system and explains how to determine the parameters of collective motion.
