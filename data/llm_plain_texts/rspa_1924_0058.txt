tldr: The author investigates the intensity variations of the night sky's light when analyzed by color filters, focusing on the green auroral line. They use a compound filter to isolate the auroral line and study its connection with solar activity. The results show that the intensity of the night sky varies and that further research is needed to understand the connection with the solar cycle.
