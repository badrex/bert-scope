tldr: The article discusses the effect of finite deformations in the elastic stability of plane frames, particularly when subjected to proportional loading. It explores the circumstances under which orthogonal relations exist between the elastic critical modes of plane frames and introduces a general expression that reveals the relation between deformations at an arbitrary load level and the deflections given by linear analysis.
