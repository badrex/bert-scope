tldr: This article presents an asymptotic formula for the number of cubic fields with a given discriminant. The authors establish a connection between cubic fields and binary cubic forms, and use this relationship to estimate the cardinality of a set of forms. Additionally, they determine the density of cubic fields in which a certain prime is totally or partially ramified. This work contributes to the understanding of number theory and algebraic geometry.
