tldr: Hermann Joseph Muller was a pioneering geneticist and evolutionary biologist who made significant contributions to the field of genetics, including the discovery of the mutagenic effects of ionizing radiations. His work focused on understanding the gene as the basis of life and its implications for human evolution. Muller advocated for voluntary germinal choice to control human evolution and improve the human race. His ideas and research laid the foundation for modern genetics and molecular biology.
