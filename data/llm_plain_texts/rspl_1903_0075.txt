tldr: The author investigates the origin of nematocysts in Solids and concludes that they are derived from their Coelenterate prey. The study examines the similarities between the nematocysts of Nudibranchs and Coelenterates, providing evidence that supports the idea that nematocysts are not part of the organic make-up of Solids.
