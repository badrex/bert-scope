revised_title: 'Electrometric Titration of Amino-Acids in Aqueous-Alcoholic Solutions'
semantic_tags:
  - Amino-acids
  - Electrometric titration
  - Zwitterions
  - Acid-base theory
  - Dissociation constants
tldr: The authors investigate the titration of amino-acids in aqueous-alcoholic solutions and provide evidence in favor of the zwitterion theory. They discuss the acid-base behavior of amino-acids and the differences in their dissociation constants in various solvents, emphasizing the importance of the dielectric constant and solvation effects.
