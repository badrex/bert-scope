tldr: This study investigates the laminar pattern and mode of termination of afferent fiber pathways in the somatic sensory cortex of the cat using electron microscopy. The research finds that degenerating commissural fibers terminate in all cortical layers, while cortico-cortical and thalamo-cortical afferents have distinct terminations. The findings provide insights into the organization and function of the cerebral cortex.
