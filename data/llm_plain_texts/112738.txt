tldr: This article examines the relationship between magnetic disturbances and terrestrial galvanic currents. The author, George Biddell Airy, compares magnetic disturbances inferred from galvanic currents recorded by self-registering galvanometers with those registered by magnetometers. He finds a close agreement between the irregularities, with galvanic irregularities usually preceding magnetic ones. The study also reveals a constant turn towards the north and a larger force towards the west in galvanic currents, suggesting they may be due to the nature of the earth's connections.
