tldr: 'This article discusses the mechanisms of DNA sequence amplification and their evolutionary consequences. It explores various examples of gene amplification in organisms, such as ribosomal DNA amplification in amphibians and the amplification of chorion protein genes in Drosophila. The article also highlights the significance of DNA amplification in somatic cells and its potential impact on the evolution of genomes.'
