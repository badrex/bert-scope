tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the specific heats of various metals at low temperatures. They compared different methods of cooling the metals and found that direct immersion in liquid air provided more accurate results. The author also developed a method to reduce errors caused by liquid air adhering to the metal samples. The findings contribute to the understanding of thermodynamics and temperature measurement.
