tldr: This article discusses the growth and form of modular organisms in plants, focusing on the physiological consequences of modular growth. It explores the mechanisms involved in module initiation, differentiation, regulation, and death. The author highlights the importance of apical meristems, accurate phyllotaxy, and diplontic selection in maintaining the stability and integrity of plant genomes. The article also explains how plants can adapt to environmental changes through variations in module growth rates and the number of functional meristems.
