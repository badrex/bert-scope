tldr: The study investigates the central pattern generator for swimming in amphibian embryos, specifically Xenopus. The researchers found that the spinal cord and hindbrain can independently generate swimming patterns, and that interactions between the left and right motor systems are not necessary for rhythm generation. The swimming pattern is achieved through autonomous rhythm generators on each side of the nervous system, with reciprocal inhibition and tonic excitation from the hindbrain driving the motoneurons.
