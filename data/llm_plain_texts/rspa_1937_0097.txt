  - Perturbation Theory
  - Variation Methods
tldr: The authors explore the energy of atomic polarization and van der Waals energy in quantum theory using perturbation and variation methods. They derive expressions for atomic polarizability and calculate the results for rare gas atoms and alkali ions, comparing them with experimental data. This study helps in understanding the behavior of atoms and their interactions in various conditions.
