tldr: The author investigates the properties of superconducting colloids and emulsions, focusing on the effects of temperature and particle size. They use mercury preparations to measure magnetic moments and deduce the critical field and susceptibility. The results provide insights into the penetration of magnetic fields in superconductors and the behavior of superconducting materials at different temperatures and particle sizes.
