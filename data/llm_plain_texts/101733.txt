tldr: The author conducted several experiments to test and challenge Mr. Newton's theory of light and colors. They found that the colored spectrum appeared in a straight line, contrary to Newton's assertion of different refrangibility in different rays. The author also discovered that the colors of the spectrum were influenced by extrinsic factors, such as neighboring objects and light reflection, rather than an intrinsic property of refrangibility.
