tldr: 'This article discusses the process of photoperception and de-etiolation in plants, focusing on the photosensory system that allows plants to detect light conditions and shift from scotomorphogenesis to photomorphogenesis. The article reviews the significance of phytochrome in signal reception and the mode of signal expression in phytochrome-mediated responses, as well as the time course of signal transduction in these processes.'
