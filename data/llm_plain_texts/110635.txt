tldr: 'The author, James F. W. Johnston, investigates the composition of various resins, focusing on mastic and dragon's blood resins. He discovers that mastic resin consists of two resins, one soluble and acidic, and the other insoluble with no acid properties. He also examines the reactions and properties of these resins, including their combinations with bases and the effects of heat.'
