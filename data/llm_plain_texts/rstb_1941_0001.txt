tldr: The article explores the color varieties and pigment systems in the plumose anemone Metridium senile. The colors are based on three pigment systems: black granular melanin in the endoderm, brown diffuse melanin in the ectoderm, and red to orange lipochrome in fat droplets in both endoderm and ectoderm. The colors are not an adaptation to the environment or of direct physiological importance to the animal, but rather a by-product of biochemical processes used for other purposes.
