tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the effects of pituitary extracts on the kidney. They found that intravenous injections of extracts from the infundibular part of the pituitary gland caused kidney vessels to dilate and increase urine flow, indicating a diuretic action. This diuretic effect was separate from the effects on blood pressure and was not present in extracts from the anterior lobe of the gland. The authors concluded that the infundibular part of the pituitary gland produces a secretion that assists in regulating kidney function.
