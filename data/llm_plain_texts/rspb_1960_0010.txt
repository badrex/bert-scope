tldr: The author investigates the genetic control of the S antigen in plants, specifically focusing on the incompatibility gene in Oenothera organensis. They study the interactions between mutant alleles and their original counterparts, providing evidence for the hypothesis that the S gene has two cistrons: one controlling the specificity of the antigen and the other controlling its activity in different tissues. This research contributes to our understanding of plant genetics and the mechanisms behind incompatibility reactions.
