tldr: This article reports on a private expedition to Philippeville, Algeria, to observe the total solar eclipse of August 30, 1905. The authors describe their observations and measurements of the eclipse, including the height of the reflecting layers of the atmosphere, meteorological conditions, and the corona. They also discuss the use of photographic techniques and the polarization of light in the outer corona. The findings provide valuable insights into the properties of the solar corona and the atmosphere during a total solar eclipse.
