tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments to study the absorption of beta-rays by matter and found that the absorption follows a linear, not exponential, law. They also discovered that the absorption of beta-rays varies with their velocity. The results challenge previous assumptions about the homogeneity of radioactive rays and their absorption patterns.'
