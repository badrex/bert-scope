tldr: This article discusses the petrology of igneous and metamorphic rocks from the ocean floor, focusing on the creation of oceanic rocks and their composition. The authors explore the connection between plate tectonics, chemical analysis, and experimental petrology in understanding the Earth's history and the processes occurring in the upper mantle. The article highlights the advancements in analytical methods, such as the electron-probe and activation analysis, and the importance of studying rocks in realistic conditions to better understand their formation.
