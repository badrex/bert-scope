tldr: 'The author investigates the electromagnetic field produced by a uniformly electrified sphere in accelerated motion. They derive expressions for the field components and discuss the mechanical reaction on the sphere. The study involves elliptic functions and Doppler factors, with a focus on the discontinuity in the normal electric force. The author provides a sketch of the calculation method and highlights the main results.'
