tldr: This article discusses the evolution and environment in the late Silurian and early Devonian periods, focusing on palaeogeographies and palaeomagnetic observations. The authors present a reconstruction of Siluro-Devonian times, considering palaeomagnetic, palaeoclimatic, and palaeontological data, as well as tectonic constraints. They emphasize the need for more reliable palaeomagnetic data and further study of palaeobiogeographical problems.
