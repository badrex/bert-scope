tldr: This study investigates the underwater shock-wave initiation of cast pentolite, a type of explosive, and examines the factors that contribute to the initiation and growth of explosions in solids. The research focuses on the effects of frontal and lateral compression, as well as shear effects, on the receptors. The findings provide insights into the initiation process of explosives and the conditions required for high-velocity detonation.
