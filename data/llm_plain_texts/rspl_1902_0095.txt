tldr: This article discusses the morphology of spore-producing members and their evolution. It explores the concept of sterilization in the sporophyte and the variations in the number of sporangia in vascular plants. The author concludes that the complexity of spore-producing parts is a result of progressive elaboration and sterilization, and that the strobilus theory can explain the origin of these structures in plants.
