tldr: The authors studied the thermal expansion of succinic and adipic acids, two types of dicarboxylic acids, and found that their crystal structures have a strong anisotropy in thermal expansion. The minimum expansion occurs along the c-axis, which is the direction of hydrogen-bonded molecular columns. The maximum expansion is observed perpendicular to the (100) planes, where van der Waals forces are more prevalent. The thermal expansion is explained by an increase in the angular vibration of the molecules.
