tldr: The authors study the structure of intermediate plagioclase felspars and their lattice and fault system. They analyze the atomic structure and the known structure of anorthite, considering the distribution of Si and Al atoms and the effects of faults on the structure. The authors also discuss the implications of their findings for dealing with other materials showing subsidiary reflexions.
