tldr: The author, William Marcet, describes the extraction and properties of a colloid acid found in healthy human urine. The acid forms two lead salts and two baryta salts, and it is very slow to decompose when exposed to air. The colloid acid is rich in carbon and poor in hydrogen, and it may play an important role in the secretion of gastric juice. The author plans to give the acid an appropriate name once more is known about its chemical composition and physiological relations.
