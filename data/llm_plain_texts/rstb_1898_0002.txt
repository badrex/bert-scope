tldr: The author conducted experiments on monkeys to examine the distribution of spinal nerve roots and their reflexes. They focused on the skin and muscular fields of cranial and cervico-brachial nerves, providing insights into the sensory and motor distributions. The study also explored spinal reflexes and their relationship to the spinal cord's overall function.
