tldr: The authors present an exact solution for heat transfer from a heated half-plane, incorporating longitudinal diffusion, using the Wiener-Hopf technique. They find that the boundary-layer solution is accurate for large Peclet numbers, and the exact theory is applicable to various heat transfer problems with different velocity profiles, wall temperature functions, and upstream conditions.
