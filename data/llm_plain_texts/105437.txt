tldr: A young lady drank sea water to treat an inflammation and tumour in her upper lip. However, she experienced severe health consequences, including excessive bleeding, petechial spots, and eventually, the mortification of her arm. The case raises questions about the potential dangers of sea water consumption and whether alternative treatments, like the Cortex Peruvianus, might be more suitable for strumous patients.
