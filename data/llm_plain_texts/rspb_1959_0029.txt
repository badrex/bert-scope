tldr: This study investigates the relationship between inter-quaternary distance and ganglion-blocking activity in bis-quaternary compounds. Researchers found that compounds with a greater inter-quaternary distance have higher ganglion-blocking activity, which could be useful in developing new drugs for treating various conditions.
