tldr: The author examines the distribution and evolution of coal fields in England, attributing their current dimensions to physical changes and tectonic movements. The study reveals that the coal measures were originally spread across large areas of England, but were later reduced due to disturbances and denudation. The author also discusses the concept of coal fields as "basins" and the potential for determining the limits of coal measures under Mesozoic formations.
