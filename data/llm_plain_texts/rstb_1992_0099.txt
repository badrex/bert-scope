tldr: This article compares the cranial shapes of late archaic human groups from Europe, southwest Asia, Africa, and East Asia with anatomically modern Homo sapiens to understand the origins of recent human evolution. The author uses the Penrose Shape Distance method to analyze the relationships between these groups and finds that the Skhul-Qafzeh sample provides the best shape intermediate between archaic and modern samples. The results support the recent African origin model, indicating that there is no specific archaic-recent regional relationship and that present-day regional characteristics developed recently.
