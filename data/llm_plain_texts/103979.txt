tldr: Dr. Cookson and Pierce Dod discovered that knives and forks that were struck by lightning developed magnetic properties. They conducted experiments to understand the factors contributing to this phenomenon and submitted their findings to the Royal Society. The authors observed that the direction of the knives and forks and the heating and cooling process during the lightning strike might have contributed to the magnetic properties.
