tldr: The authors calculate the probability and cross-section of positron annihilation by bound electrons in lead atoms. They find that the radiationless annihilation process is more probable than the radiative one, with a maximum cross-section of 1-2 cmÂ² for incident positrons of 100,000 volts energy. This process is important for understanding the behavior of positrons in atomic systems and has implications for nuclear physics and particle physics research.
