tldr: The study investigates the composition of the interstitial fluid in the honeybee drone's retina, focusing on the supply of substrates for energy metabolism from blood to neurons. The research reveals that the extracellular concentrations of amino acids, such as proline, glutamine, alanine, and (3-alanine, are higher than in the haemolymph. The identified carbohydrates, trehalose, glucose, pyruvate, and fructose, are less concentrated than in the haemolymph. These findings suggest that the extracellular concentration of alanine is ample for it to serve as a major substrate of neuronal energy metabolism in the retina.
