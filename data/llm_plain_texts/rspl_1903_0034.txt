tldr: The author discovered that solid or highly viscous coatings spontaneously form on the free surfaces of proteid solutions and suspensions. These coatings can be heaped up to form visible solid masses, which can be de-soluted, coagulated, and rendered insoluble in the mother liquid. The author explains that these de-solutions and coagulations are due to the accumulation of certain dissolved or suspended matters at the surfaces, which lower the surface tension and surface energy of the liquid. This phenomenon can also be observed in non-proteid colloid solutions, fine and coarse suspensions, and at the interfaces of liquids forming persistent emulsions.
