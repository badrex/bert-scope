tldr: The author presents a new Hamiltonian with linear kinetic energy for systems of many bodies using Clifford algebra. This Hamiltonian incorporates potential energy interactions between particles and can be applied to molecular structures. The author discusses the challenges of constructing a Lorentz-covariant quantum-mechanical operator for many particles and proposes a solution using a single time variable.
