tldr: This article explores the unique composition of sandstone from Hemlock Stone and Bramcote Hill, which contains a large amount of barium sulphate. The barium sulphate acts as a cement, binding the sand grains together and making the sandstone more resistant to weathering. The author also discusses the possible formation of the barium sulphate in the sandstone and its potential implications for understanding the geological processes in the area.
