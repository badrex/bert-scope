tldr: The author demonstrates exact connections between the properties of two-dimensional polycrystalline aggregates and those of its constituent elongated crystals. The analysis is given for piezoelectric crystals and polycrystals, assuming both belong to the 2mm class of the orthorhombic system. The study provides a foundation for understanding the effective properties of composite materials and their relationship to the properties of individual crystals.
