tldr: The author presents a new system for classifying and describing sponges based on their anatomical structures and skeleton compositions. They establish three main orders (Calcarea, Silicea, and Keratosa) and divide them into suborders and genera, providing detailed descriptions of each. This new classification system aims to improve the understanding and identification of sponge species.
