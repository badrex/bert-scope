tldr: The authors analyzed osmotic coefficient data for bivalent sulfate solutions to determine the dissociation constants of ion pairs, triplets, and quadruplets, as well as their hydration parameters. They found that the dissociation constants of sulfate ion pairs show distinct individualities, and the hydration parameters of associated sulfates are only slightly smaller than those of fully dissociated electrolytes. This study provides valuable information on the behavior of ionic associations in aqueous solutions.
