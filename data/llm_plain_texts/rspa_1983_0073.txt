tldr: This article investigates the invariance properties of partial differential approximants for power series in two or more variables. The authors demonstrate that certain classes of approximants exhibit desirable properties, such as Eulerian invariance under changes of variables and rotational invariance under homogeneous linear transformations. The study also covers constrained, multipoint, and higher-order differential approximants, providing extensions of known invariance properties of ordinary Pade approximants and inhomogeneous differential approximants.
