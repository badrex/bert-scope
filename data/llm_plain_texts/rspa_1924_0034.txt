tldr: 'The author describes a method to determine the crystal-axes in single-crystal aluminium bars using X-rays. The technique involves measuring the angles between the incident X-ray beam, the reference plane, and the reflected X-rays. The method provides information about the orientation of the crystal lattice and can be applied to other metals as well.'
