tldr: The author, George G. Stokes, discovered a long spectrum of electric light using quartz prisms and lenses. He found that aluminum produced the richest invisible rays of extreme refrangibility. The study also showed that certain substances, like alkaloids and glucosides, were intensely opaque to these invisible rays. Stokes also observed fluorescence in various crystals, such as adullaria and felspar, under the action of high refrangibility rays.
