tldr: In this article, William Prout describes the process of extracting a new acid principle from lithic or uric acid. He calls this new acid "purpuric acid" due to its ability to form compounds with various bases that produce red or purple colors. Prout discusses the properties and reactions of purpuric acid, as well as its potential applications in the field of acid chemistry.
