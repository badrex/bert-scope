tldr: The article discusses the integral solutions of the equations of thin plates, focusing on the interior and exterior Dirichlet problems. It presents a method to construct a generalization of the problem and proves the uniqueness of the solution. The article also explores the non-solubility of the equation under certain conditions and introduces a specific example of a curve and matrix for which the equation has non-zero solutions.
