tldr: The authors obtained high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of carbon-13 substituted ethane, ethylene, and acetylene. They analyzed the spectra to determine the magnitudes of inter-nuclear coupling constants, including those between pairs of carbon nuclei. The study provides valuable insights into the electronic structures of these molecules and contributes to the understanding of inter-proton coupling constants in hydrocarbons.
