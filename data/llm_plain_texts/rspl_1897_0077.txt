revised_title: Electrification Effects on Resin and Resin-Oil Compounds
semantic_tags:

  - Viscid compounds
  - Stress figures
tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effects of electrification on resin and resin-oil compounds. They discovered that these compounds can respond to mechanical stress caused by non-luminous electrical discharges, creating unique stress figures. The author also found that a smooth resin surface can retain an electric charge for an extended period, attracting dust in a discriminative manner.
