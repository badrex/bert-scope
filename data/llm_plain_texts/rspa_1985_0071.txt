revised_title: Killing Spinors and Their Applications in Massless Spinor Fields
semantic_tags:
  - Spinors
  - Massless spinor fields
  - Weyl equation
  - Maxwell equations
  - Kerr metric
tldr: The article demonstrates that in a space-time that admits a Killing spinor, any solution of the Weyl or Maxwell equations can be used as a potential for another solution of the corresponding equation. The new solution can be generated by a single component of the given one, which satisfies a decoupled equation. The connection between the procedure and several results previously known for the Kerr metric is established.
