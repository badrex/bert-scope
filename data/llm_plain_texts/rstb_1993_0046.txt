tldr: The study examines the changes in ampullate silk gland morphology and usage in the araneid spider Araneus cavaticus during moulting. It reveals that smaller pairs of major and minor ampullate silk glands function during the period preceding each ecdysis, taking over the duties of the larger glands. These smaller glands are retained in adults and are essential for ensuring continuity of ampullate silk production. The research also proposes a new terminology for the larger, smaller, and accessory ampullate glands to emphasize their shared kinship and functions.
