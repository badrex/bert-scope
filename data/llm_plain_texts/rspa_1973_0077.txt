tldr: The article investigates the short-range order and disorder in the organic molecule acenaphthylene. It explores the transition from a disordered to an ordered form and explains the observed sequence of diffuse diffraction phenomena using a simple model based on short-range order parameters. The study provides insights into the interactions involved in the local crystal structure of organic compounds.
