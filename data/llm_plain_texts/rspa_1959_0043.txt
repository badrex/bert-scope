tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the hydrogenation of butene-2 and isobutene, studying the radicals produced in the primary reaction. They found that the hydrogenation of isobutene yields tert-butyl radicals, while the hydrogenation of butene-2 mainly produces sec-butyl radicals. The results indicate that abstraction reactions from the parent olefines yield unsaturated radicals, and the rate of decomposition of these radicals depends on the pressure in the system.
