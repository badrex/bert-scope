tldr: The author examines the correctness of a conclusion by De la Roche about the passage of radiant heat through glass screens. The author conducts experiments with different glass screens and temperatures, observing the effects on the heat transmission. The results show that the rise of the focal thermometer is not due to any new property acquired by the heat, but rather the effect of secondary radiation from the heated screens.
