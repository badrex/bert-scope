tldr: In a letter to Mr. Magellan, Mr. Messier describes observing a belt of fainter light on Saturn's disc. He suggests that better instruments may reveal inequalities in the belt, which could help determine the planet's axial rotation time. This phenomenon was previously discovered by John and James Cassini in the late 17th century.
