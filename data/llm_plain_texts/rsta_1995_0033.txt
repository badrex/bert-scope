semantic_tags:
  - Ammonia exchange
  - Plant-atmosphere interaction
  - Environmental pollution
  - Acidification
  - Nitrogen eutrophication
tldr: This article discusses the exchange of ammonia between land and atmosphere, focusing on plant-atmosphere exchange. It presents recent controlled environment and micrometeorological measurements to understand the factors controlling the exchange. The authors propose a new resistance model that integrates environmental and biological factors to predict net exchange. The study highlights the importance of ammonia exchange in assessing the effects of regional atmospheric pollution and in understanding the acidification and nitrogen eutrophication of ecosystems.
