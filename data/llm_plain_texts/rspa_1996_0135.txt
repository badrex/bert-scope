tldr: The authors explore the phenomenon of internal resonance in systems that can escape from a potential well, specifically in the context of ship capsize. They establish equations for studying internal resonance in coupled nonlinear oscillators and demonstrate that capsize can be significantly suppressed when the heave frequency is tuned to twice the wave frequency. This research has implications for improving the stability of ships and offshore oil production facilities in challenging sea conditions.
