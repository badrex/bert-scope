tldr: The author presents an improved similarity solution for shock waves moving through regions of non-uniform gas density. The study allows for the estimation of shock strength and speed changes as the shock moves under conditions of approximately constant energy. The solution can be applied to plane, cylindrical, and spherical waves, with the main focus being on plane waves. This research offers a technique for exploring regions of unknown density by observing the behavior of plane shocks traversing them.
