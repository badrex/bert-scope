tldr: The author examines the shoulder girdle structure and evolution in Sauropterygia, a group of ancient marine reptiles. They suggest that the precoracoid, a cartilaginous element, was part of the shoulder girdle in Ichthyosaurus and that this cartilage usually articulated with the scapula and coracoids. This finding brings the shoulder girdle of Ichthyosaurus into harmony with Nothosaurus and Anomodontia, suggesting a cartilaginous precoracoid in these species as well.
