tldr: This article presents a method for determining the activities of specific components in tholeiitic melts, which helps in understanding the behavior of iron and its oxides in geological assemblages. The technique involves measuring the activity of FeO in a silicate melt by reducing iron into a platinum foil and calculating the activity of iron in the melt using equilibrium constants. This method allows for a better understanding of the role of component activities in natural and synthetic silicate melts.
