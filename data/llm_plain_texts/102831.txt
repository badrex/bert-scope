tldr: In the 17th century, Dr. Joseph Del Papa discovered a strange substance called the Indian Varnish, which caused unusual skin reactions when applied to humans. The varnish produced swelling, inflammation, and itching on the skin, but did not harm internal organs. Despite its mysterious composition and effects, the varnish did not contain any known poisonous substances like mercury. Researchers are still trying to understand the chemical composition and properties of the Indian Varnish.
