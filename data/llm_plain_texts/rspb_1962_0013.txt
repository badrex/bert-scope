tldr: The authors investigated the presence of auxins in tomato crown-gall tissue and found that the auxins in the crown-gall tissue were the same as those in normal stem extracts, but present in higher amounts. They identified 3-indolylacetic acid (IAA), 3-indole-carboxylic acid (IGA), and 3-indolyl-acetonitrile (IAN) in both crown-gall and normal stem tissue extracts. The high auxin levels in crown-gall tissue could be due to differences in auxin production, conversion, or destruction between normal and crown-gall cells.
