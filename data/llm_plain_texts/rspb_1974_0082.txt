tldr: The authors provide evidence that patterns of race formation in Heliconius butterflies in tropical America are the result of isolation in forest refugia during climatic changes in the Quaternary period. This hypothesis is supported by the distribution of races in the butterfly genus Heliconius, which closely coincides with the distribution of species and subspecies in birds and reptiles. The study of Heliconius butterflies helps to understand the role of climatically induced forest refuges in the evolution of tropical species.
