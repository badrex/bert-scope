tldr: The author discusses the morphology of foot-and-mouth disease and vesicular stomatitis viruses, emphasizing the rod-like forms and their size variations. They argue against the idea that these long forms are made up of spherical or coccoid bodies and provide evidence supporting their existence. The author also addresses the differences in virus size and shape in older lesions and suggests that morphological changes can be a result of environmental changes.
