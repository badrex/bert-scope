tldr: The authors propose using the anisotropy of the electronic g-factor to study ring currents in polycyclic hydrocarbons. They calculate the anisotropy of the g-factor components and show that it arises from the spin-other-orbit interaction. The study provides a new method to investigate ring currents in paramagnetic species, complementing existing methods for diamagnetic molecules.
