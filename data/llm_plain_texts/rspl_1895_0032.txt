tldr: This study investigates the degeneration resulting from minute lesions of the motor area of the cortex cerebri in bonnet monkeys. The researchers traced the degeneration through the brain and spinal cord, locating the path of conducting fibers and observing their destinations. The findings provide insights into the connections and functions of the motor area and contribute to the understanding of brain injuries and their effects on motor functions.
