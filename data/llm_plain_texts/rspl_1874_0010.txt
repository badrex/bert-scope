tldr: The authors studied the structure and development of snake teeth, discovering that they have a unique arrangement and formation process compared to other animals. They found that snake teeth do not have cementum, and the tooth-germs consist of a dentine-germ, enamel-organ, and a weak capsule. The tooth arrangement is peculiar and characteristic of Ophidia, with numerous successional teeth in a single section. The attachment of the teeth to the jaw is through a coarse bone that is not derived from the tooth-capsule.
