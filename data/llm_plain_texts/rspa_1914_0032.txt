tldr: The author investigates the unusual deflections of the plumb-line near the southern edge of the Himalayas and proposes an alternative explanation for these deflections. They suggest that the effect of the Gangetic alluvium, which has a lower density than the surrounding rocks, is responsible for the observed deflections. This explanation is based on the geological structure and the depth of the alluvial deposits along the southern margin of the Himalayas.
