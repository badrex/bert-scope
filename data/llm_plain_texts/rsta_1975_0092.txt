tldr: This article discusses the early history of ionospheric research and the development of the magnetoionic theory by Sir Edward Appleton and his colleagues in the International Union of Radio Science (U.R.S.I.). The authors describe the significant contributions made by Appleton and other researchers during the period of 1922-1938, including the discovery of multiple ionized layers in the upper atmosphere, the influence of the Earth's magnetic field on wireless transmissions, and the correlation between solar activity and radio transmission. The article highlights the importance of collaboration between amateur radio enthusiasts and professional scientists in advancing the understanding of ionospheric phenomena.
