tldr: Joseph Priestley conducted experiments to study the composition of water and the principle of acidity. He discovered that when air is decomposed, a new acid is formed, which he identified as nitrous acid. This finding challenged the phlogiston theory and contributed to the understanding of chemical reactions and the composition of air.
