tldr: This article discusses the use of the Laue method in time-resolved macromolecular crystallography to observe short-lived species in enzyme reactions. The authors explore different triggering methods, such as pH jumps, temperature jumps, and metal ion diffusion, to generate the desired intermediate species with high occupancy in the crystal lattice. They also address the challenges of synchronization and the potential of the Laue technique in studying unstable species accumulated under defined conditions for short periods of time.
