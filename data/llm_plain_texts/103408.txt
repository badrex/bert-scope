tldr: The author, Mr. Leeuwenhoek, conducted a series of experiments to observe the vessels in different types of wood and the muscular fibers of animals. He discovered that the ascending vessels in wood carry nutrients and that the fine membranes surrounding muscle fibers contain numerous small vessels that transport nourishment. He also found that blood can pass through these fibers, but it must be divided into 64 parts before entering, providing evidence for blood circulation.
