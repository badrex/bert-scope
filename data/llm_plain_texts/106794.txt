tldr: The author, George Fordyce, conducted experiments to determine the cause of the additional weight metals acquire when calcined. He found that the weight change did not come from the acid, alkali, or water used in the process. The experiment involved dissolving zinc in vitriolic acid, precipitating the calx, and then comparing the weight of the original zinc to the weight of the calcined calx. This research aimed to understand the phlogiston theory and the nature of chemical reactions.
