tldr: The author presents a comprehensive theory of sextactic points of a plane curve, which are singular points where six consecutive points of the curve lie in a conic. The number of sextactic points is determined by the curve's order, and the author provides a detailed method for calculating these points using mathematical equations and transformations.
