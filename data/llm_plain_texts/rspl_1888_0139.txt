tldr: The author discusses the changes in the optical properties of glass surfaces after polishing. They suggest that the polishing process may increase the optical density of the surface layer, leading to changes in the amount of reflected and transmitted light. The author also mentions that the surface of flint glass appears to change more readily than crown glass. This research was communicated by Professor J. J. Thomson, F.R.S.
