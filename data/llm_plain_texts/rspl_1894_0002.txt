tldr: The author discusses the problem of dividing space into equal and similar parts called cells, focusing on the tetrakaidekahedron as a solution for a homogeneous assemblage of points or molecules. The tetrakaidekahedron is a geometric shape with 14 walls, 36 edges, and 24 corners, and is a more general form of cell than the parallelepipedal partitioning. The author provides a method for creating these cells and explains their applications in crystallography and other fields.
