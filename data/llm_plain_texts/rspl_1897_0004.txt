tldr: The authors conducted a series of experiments on animals to investigate the relationship between the cerebellum and other parts of the nervous system. They discovered that when the cerebral hemispheres are removed, excitation of the cerebellum causes relaxation of the triceps and contraction of the biceps. This effect is constant and distinct, indicating a relationship between the cerebellum and the bulbospinal system of lower centers. The authors also found that the effect is unilateral, with the right half of the cerebellum having a greater influence on the right arm muscles.
