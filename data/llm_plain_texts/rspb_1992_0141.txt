tldr: The authors present a model for the coevolution of predator and prey body sizes, using the Lotka-Volterra population dynamics. They find that within a region of the phenotype space, predator and prey species can coexist, and evolutionarily stable strategies and evolutionary saddles may be present. The results show that the interaction between intra- and interspecific interactions is crucial in determining the evolutionary pathway, and that the environment continually deteriorates as evolution takes place, canceling out any tendency to move up an adaptive landscape.
