tldr: 'The authors studied the effects of ultra-violet light irradiation on \lt;italic\gt;Bact. lactis aerogenes\lt;/italic\gt; bacteria. They found that irradiation damaged one of the key enzyme systems responsible for supplying carbon compounds needed for ammonia conversion to amino-acids. This damage could be repaired by growing the bacteria in ammonium salt media, supporting the idea of autosynthetic enzyme systems. The study highlights the importance of quantitative measurements in understanding bacterial mutations.'
