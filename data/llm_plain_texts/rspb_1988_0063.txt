tldr: This article discusses statistical inference methods for single ion channel models, specifically focusing on two-state Markov models with limited time resolution. The authors present a likelihood approach to inference and explore the effects of time resolution limitations on parameter estimation. They also introduce a bi-exponential approximation to improve the accuracy of the model. The study demonstrates the usefulness of likelihood methods in understanding ion channel behavior.
