tldr: This article discusses the stratigraphy of post-Palaeozoic sequences in part of the western English Channel. The authors used micropalaeontological investigations, continuous reflexion seismic profiling, and gravity core sampling to study the area's geology. They identified major structures, such as the large syncline and the Alderney-Ushant structural line, and analyzed the various rock layers, including Permo-Triassic, Lias, Bathonian, Jurassic, and Lower Cretaceous formations.
