tldr: 'The authors studied sperm length variation in 20 species of North American passerine birds and found a positive correlation between sperm length and the length of female sperm storage tubules, as well as a negative correlation between sperm length and the number of storage tubules. These correlations suggest that sperm competition for access to storage sites in females influences sperm size in birds. The study provides insights into avian mating systems and the interactions between sperm and female reproductive structures.'
