tldr: The authors investigated the formation of stable metal sols in non-dissociating liquids, specifically nickel sols in toluene and benzene. They discovered that adding protective colloids, such as rubber, can help create stable sols. The properties of the nickel sol in toluene-Benzene include opacity in thicker layers, clear brown color in thinner layers, and the ability to concentrate without coagulation. The sol's electrical properties were also examined, revealing no cataphoresis and uniform deposits on electrodes when exposed to an electric field.
