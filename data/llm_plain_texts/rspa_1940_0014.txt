tldr: This article introduces a new method called the quasi-chemical method to study the thermodynamics of super-lattices, which are complex alloys with long-range order. The authors apply this method to a simple lattice composed of equal numbers of two types of atoms and compare it with previous methods like Bethe's method. The quasi-chemical method provides a more powerful and convenient approach to understanding the behavior of super-lattices and other types of lattices with long-range order.
