tldr: This paper investigates the field created by a point source of energy in an isotropic, elastic medium with a free surface. The author develops new plane wave representations for the fundamental solutions of elastodynamics and applies this approach to various types of point sources, including vertical loads, horizontal loads, and couples. The study has implications for understanding earthquake motions, explosive charge effects, and tectonic earthquakes.
