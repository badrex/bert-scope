tldr: The author investigates the electromotive properties of the leaf of Dionaea in both excited and unexcited states. They describe the apparatus and methods used in their investigation and present experimental results related to the electrical phenomena of the plant. The study infers that the "cross difference" is an expression of electromotive forces in living protoplasm cells and is due to the contact of cells in different physiological activity states.
