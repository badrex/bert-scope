tldr: The author studied the diurnal variation of the magnetic declination at St. Helena and found that the north end of a magnet moves in a different direction during different times of the year. The movement is influenced by the Earth's magnetic field and is more prominent in the summer months. The study showed that St. Helena's diurnal variation has characteristics of both the northern and southern hemispheres, but each dominates in different seasons.
