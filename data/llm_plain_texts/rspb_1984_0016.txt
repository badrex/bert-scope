tldr: The author's study reveals that the 'coronate' amacrine cells in the rabbit retina have the'starburst' dendritic morphology. By using the fluorescent dye DAPI and filling the cells with Lucifer yellow, the author found that the coronate amacrines in the ganglion cell layer are type b starburst cells, while those in the inner nuclear layer with a coronate-like nuclear morphology are type a starburst cells. This discovery helps in understanding the structure and function of these cells in the retina.
