tldr: The authors investigated the solubilization of isolated brain synaptosomal plasma membranes using various detergents and isolated postsynaptic junctional particles with different ultrastructural appearances and protein contents. They found that the detergent concentration significantly affected the extraction of protein and phospholipid from the membranes. The study aimed to understand the supramolecular structure of the postsynaptic junctional specialization and identified two major common components with molecular masses of 275,000 and 47,500 in the isolated junctional structures.
