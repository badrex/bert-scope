tldr: The authors investigated the susceptibility of human skin fibroblasts, including those from Werner's syndrome and other conditions, to SV40-induced transformation and immortalization. They found that while most cultures showed transformed properties, only a few survived the crisis period and became permanent lines. This study highlights the rarity of transformation by SV40 in human skin fibroblasts, even in cells from patients predisposed to cancer.
