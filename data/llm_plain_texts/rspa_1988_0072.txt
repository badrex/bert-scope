tldr: The authors classify positive-definite integral quadratic forms of small determinant and dimension, providing a systematic notation for low-dimensional lattices and their applications in number theory. They use techniques such as complementation and supplementation to enumerate lattices and make use of properties of root lattices. This research simplifies and systematizes the work of others while also presenting new results.
