revised_title: 'Understanding Bacterial Interference with Host Defences: A Review'
semantic_tags:
  - Bacterial Pathogenicity
  - Host Defence Interference
  - Bacterial Surface Components
  - Infection Mechanisms
  - Gonococci Resistance
tldr: This article discusses the challenges in identifying the determinants of bacterial interference with non-specific host defenses during the early stages of infection. It highlights the difficulties in proving causation and the importance of studying organisms grown in vivo. The author provides a brief survey of the activities of various pathogenic bacteria, focusing on recent work on the resistance of gonococci to killing by human serum and phagocytes.
