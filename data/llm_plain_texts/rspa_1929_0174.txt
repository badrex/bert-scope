tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the growth of silver iodide films and compared different methods for measuring the thickness of the films. They found that the "New Colour Method" was more accurate than the direct weighing method and that pre-exposure to air did not significantly affect the growth of iodide films. The study also explored the effects of solvent, stirring rate, abrasive treatment, temperature, and concentration of solution on the rate of formation of silver iodide films.
