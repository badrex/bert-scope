tldr: Dr. Nettleton's letter discusses the practice of inoculation for smallpox and compares its mortality rates to the natural occurrence of the disease. He shares data from various towns, showing that the mortality rate for those who were inoculated was significantly lower than those who contracted the disease naturally. This information provides insight into the effectiveness of inoculation as a preventive measure against smallpox.
