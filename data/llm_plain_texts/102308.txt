tldr: The author, Stephen Gray, discovered that water can act as a natural microscope, allowing for the observation of tiny objects and microorganisms. He found that by using a droplet of water on a flat surface, he could create a plano-convex lens that could magnify objects. This method allowed for the observation of microorganisms, such as those discovered by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, with greater clarity and magnification than traditional glass microscopes. The author also explored the use of water as a natural catadioptric microscope, utilizing reflection and refraction to improve the performance of the device.
