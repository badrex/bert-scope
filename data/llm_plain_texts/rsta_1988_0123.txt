tldr: This article presents the geological evolution of the Tibetan Plateau, focusing on the sedimentology, paleoecology, and paleoenvironmental changes of the 1985 Lhasa to Golmud Geotraverse. The authors analyzed and measured over 30 km of sections at 113 localities, studying the various terranes and their depositional environments throughout different geological periods. The study provides insights into the basin and plate tectonic history of the region.
