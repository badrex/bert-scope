tldr: The authors conducted a detailed analytical investigation of the reactions occurring during the early stages of ethyl alcohol (ethanol) oxidation in the temperature range of 270 to 370Â°C. They found that during the induction period, ethanol is converted quantitatively into acetaldehyde and hydrogen peroxide. The pressure then begins to rise autocatalytically, and methanol, formaldehyde, and carbon monoxide become detectable. The study also explores the influence of reactant pressures and the effect of the surface on the reaction.
