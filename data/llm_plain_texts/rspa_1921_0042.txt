tldr: The author presents a method for controlling heat conduction in a liquid oxygen container to efficiently vaporize the liquid for use in portable breathing apparatus. The apparatus allows for a steady stream of gas and can be adjusted to deliver various rates of gas, making it suitable for mine rescue work and other applications. Additionally, the author describes an innovative device for detecting periodicity in engineering data.
