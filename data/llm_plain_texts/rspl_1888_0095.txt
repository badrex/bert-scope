tldr: This article presents preliminary findings on the magnetization of iron at high temperatures. The author, J. Hopkinson, observes that the magnetization of iron decreases with increasing temperature, and the permeability of the material increases rapidly at high temperatures before disappearing entirely. The results are discussed in terms of magnetic molecules and their orientation.
