tldr: The author proposes modifying Einstein's theory of gravitation by reintroducing Weyl's geometry, which involves a revival of the non-integrable lengths when carried around closed loops. This modification accounts for both gravitational and electromagnetic fields, providing a unification of long-range forces. The Large Numbers Hypothesis is also discussed, suggesting that all dimensionless numbers in nature are connected and that the gravitational constant is decreasing with time.
