revised_title: 'Canal Mechanism and Cupula Function in the Vestibular System'
semantic_tags:
  - Vestibular system
  - Otolith organs
  - Pressure changes
  - Reflex muscular contraction
  - Cupula
tldr: The article discusses the possibility of a canal mechanism in the vestibular system, which could be responsible for signaling pressure changes and their direction. The authors propose that the cupula, a heavily damped torsion pendulum, plays a crucial role in this mechanism, allowing for accurate muscular responses to pressure changes.
