tldr: The authors present a new matrix theory for electron scattering at intermediate energies, which allows for a more accurate representation of target states and pseudostates. This new approach involves calculating a complete set of electron-target bound and continuum states and using them to represent target states for the scattering process. The method is illustrated by applying it to the elastic wave scattering of electrons by atomic hydrogen from threshold to 1.
