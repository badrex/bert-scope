tldr: This paper presents the results of a discussion of about 19,000 tide observations at Bristol. The author, T. G. Bunt, aimed to obtain the empirical laws of diurnal inequalities in times and heights of high water and the solar inequality of tides. The observations were taken using a self-registering tide-gauge, and the results show that the diurnal inequalities are not very large. The author also discusses the solar inequality and its effects on tides.
