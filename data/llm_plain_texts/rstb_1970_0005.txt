tldr: The study examines the fine structure and connectivity of layers III to VI in the somatic sensory cortex of the cat. It describes the distinct features of each layer, including the presence of large apical dendrites, small myelinated and unmyelinated axons, and various types of neurons. The research provides insights into the organization and function of the sensory cortex, which is essential for understanding how the brain processes sensory information.
