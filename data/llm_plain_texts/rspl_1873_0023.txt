tldr: The author conducted experiments using electric action on a mixture of hydrogen and carbonic oxide gases to synthesize formic aldehyde. They found that the gas contained hydrogen, marsh-gas, and formic aldehyde in specific proportions. The author also discussed the possible decomposition of formic aldehyde and shared plans to present more experiments on the subject in the future.
