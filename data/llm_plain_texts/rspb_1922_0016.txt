tldr: 'This study investigates the oxidation processes of the echinoderm egg during fertilization. The author discusses previous research on oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide output during fertilization and presents new experiments using a special type of manometer. The results show a significant increase in the oxidation rate of the egg after fertilization and a close relationship between oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide output.'
