tldr: This article presents experiments conducted on the specific heat of ferromagnetic substances, focusing on iron, nickel, and steel. The authors used a new method to measure specific heat and magnetization simultaneously, enabling them to directly measure specific heat over small temperature intervals. The results provide a better understanding of the relationship between magnetic properties and heat treatment in ferromagnetic materials.
