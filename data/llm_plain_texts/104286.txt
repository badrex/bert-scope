tldr: In December 1733, Mr. Crocker observed a meteor in the daytime, resembling a paper kite with a silver brightness. The meteor had a larger body and longer train than any star-shooting he had seen before. Others in the area also witnessed the phenomenon, and it was reported to have traveled from east to west. This account highlights the early interest in meteorological and astronomical phenomena.
