tldr: 'The author, Moses Lindo, discovered a new potential source of dye from the berries of a weed in South Carolina. He observed that the berries were initially thought to be poisonous, but after seeing birds excreting the same colored waste, he decided to experiment with extracting a dye from them. He successfully extracted a black dye from the berries without the use of alum, which turned the juice in another container containing alum black as well.'
