tldr: The authors developed a method to evaluate the nine hyperfine interaction tensor components in molecular systems, particularly for a one-electron system. They used Slater-type orbitals to describe the electronic wavefunction and applied their method to a molecule containing a transition metal ion in a strong crystal field. The results showed the degree of non-coincidence of the and A tensors and the n.m.r. shifts arising from the electron-nuclear interaction.
