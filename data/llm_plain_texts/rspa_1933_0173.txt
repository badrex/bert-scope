tldr: 'The authors studied the long-range alpha particles emitted by radium C and analyzed their energy levels. They found 66 alpha particles correlated with X-rays and discussed the limitations of their experimental method. The research aimed to contribute to the understanding of atomic structure and nuclear disturbances in heavy atoms.'
