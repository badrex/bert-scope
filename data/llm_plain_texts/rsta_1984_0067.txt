tldr: The article presents a methodology for computer-assisted proof using an algorithmic metalanguage to express tactics and combinators. The method focuses on providing a metalogical framework for users to express their insights into proof methods and delegate routine work to the computer. The author demonstrates the methodology's application in machine-assisted proof and discusses recent developments and applications of the method.
