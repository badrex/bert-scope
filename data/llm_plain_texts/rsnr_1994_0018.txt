tldr: This article reviews two books: one about Josiah Wedgwood, a prominent figure in the pottery industry, and his relationships with Erasmus Darwin and Thomas Bentley, and another about William Murdoch, an important lieutenant in the Boulton and Watt steam enterprise. The author appreciates the books for shedding light on lesser-known aspects of these figures' lives and their contributions to the industrial revolution.
