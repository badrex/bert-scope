tldr: This article explores various methods for solving the inverse scattering problem, which involves determining the shape and constitution of a scattering body based on the incident field and scattered far field. The authors develop a computationally orientated approach using the optical extinction theorem and discuss direct and inverse scattering methods. They also introduce a new method for reconstructing the shapes of certain bodies of revolution and cylindrical bodies from scattered fields observed at two closely spaced frequencies.
