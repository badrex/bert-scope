tldr: The author conducted experiments on artificial congelation, observing the behavior of water as it froze. They discovered that water rises and falls in a crystal vessel during the freezing process, and that the speed of this motion varies. The author also found that the freezing process happens quickly and that the water's properties change as it freezes. These observations led them to consider the potential use of a "nice thermometer" for measuring temperature changes.
