tldr: 'This study investigates the cycling of ammonium between the cnidarian animal host and intracellular symbiotic algae in the zooxanthellate coral Stylophora pistillata. The researchers found that the coral efficiently recycles inorganic nitrogen between the symbionts, and they developed a model to estimate the rate of ammonium excretion in the coral. The study suggests that 90% of the zooxanthellae's nitrogen demand is met by recycled nitrogen, and that nitrogen turns over at a rate of 0.13 per day in the algae and 0.013 per day within the animal tissue.'
