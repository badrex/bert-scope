tldr: This study investigates the effects of various metal-porphyrin complexes on the chemical shifts and linewidths of caffeine's proton resonances and the electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of the metal porphyrins in chloroform solution. The results suggest that molecular complex formation occurs between caffeine and the metal porphyrins, and acceptable structures involve a plane-to-plane arrangement with the metal above the N9 of the five-membered ring.
