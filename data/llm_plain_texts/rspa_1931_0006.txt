tldr: The author investigates the isotopic constitution and atomic weights of zinc, tin, chromium, and molybdenum using mass spectroscopy. They find that these elements have multiple isotopes with varying abundance ratios. The study helps determine the atomic weights of these elements, providing a better understanding of their properties and behavior in chemical reactions.
