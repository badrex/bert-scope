tldr: This study compares the light-harvesting capabilities and quantum yields of zooxanthellae in light- and shade-adapted colonies of the coral Stylophora pistillata. Shade-adapted corals have higher pigment content, allowing them to have twice the light-harvesting capability of light-adapted corals. However, light-adapted corals have a higher quantum yield by a factor of about 1.5. The research explores the effects of depth and light gradients on the densities of zooxanthellae and their photosynthetic performance.
