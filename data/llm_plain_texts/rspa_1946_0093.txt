tldr: This article presents a general kinetic theory of liquids that aims to provide a basis for investigating the equilibrium and dynamic properties of liquids. The authors introduce a set of multiform distribution functions and derive the generalized continuity equations. They show that Boltzmann's equation in the kinetic theory of gases is a particular case of this theory, and the theory is consistent with statistical mechanics in equilibrium conditions. The authors also indicate how the theory can be applied to solve both equilibrium and dynamic problems of the liquid state.
