tldr: This article discusses a dispute over a previous paper on electron paramagnetic resonance and Debye temperature. The author, K. N. Shrivastava, claims that his work laid the foundation for the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity, which was later awarded the Nobel prize to Bednorz and Muller in 1987. The article also includes an addendum on the instability of flow in a streamwise corner.
