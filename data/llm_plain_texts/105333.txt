tldr: This article describes the discovery of a fossilized skeleton of an ancient animal found in the Alum Rock near Whitby. The author discusses the animal's characteristics, size, and possible origins, suggesting that it is likely antediluvian based on the surrounding geological strata and the impossibility of it being buried any other way. The animal's similarities to other ancient creatures found in rivers and lakes are also noted.
