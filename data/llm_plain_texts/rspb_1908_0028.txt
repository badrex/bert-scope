tldr: The author studies the life-history of Trypanosoma equiperdum, a type of parasite, and discovers a cyclical metamorphosis in its development. The parasite alternates between periods of high and low numbers in the blood, undergoing changes in its structure and behavior. The study also suggests a potential novel form of sexual process and indicates that the life-cycle of the parasite may be completed within the host, such as rats or humans.
