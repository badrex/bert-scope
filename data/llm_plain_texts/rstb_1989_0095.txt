tldr: This article reviews the evidence for and against disaster theories of the Cretaceous-Tertiary (K-T) boundary and the extinction of dinosaurs. It discusses the challenges in determining the precise stratigraphic level of extinction and the various methods used to define the K-T boundary. The author highlights the importance of understanding the timing and nature of the extinction to evaluate disaster theories, such as the Alvarez hypothesis, which suggests that a meteorite impact caused the mass extinction event.
