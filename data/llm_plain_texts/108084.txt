tldr: The author applies a general method of finding the sums of integrals to discover properties of different transcendents, focusing on the arcs of circles and conic sections. They explore theorems involving tangents and their relation to arcs, as well as the properties of the integral x. The author also discusses the analogy between the area of a circle and the arc of a parabola, demonstrating theorems applicable to both shapes.
