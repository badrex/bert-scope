tldr: The author discovered a new substance, naphthalene, produced during the decomposition of coal tar when exposed to red heat. Naphthalene is a thick, dark liquid with unique properties, such as burning with a blue and then white flame, and having an aromatic smell. The author also described the process of distilling naphthalene and its various products, including an oily fluid, water, and a white crystalline substance. Further examination of these products revealed their chemical properties and potential uses.
