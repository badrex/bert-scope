tldr: The author, Richard Chenevix, conducted experiments to study oxygenized and hyperoxygenized muriatic acid and their combinations with potash. He discovered the proportions of oxygen and muriatic acid in these compounds and demonstrated that they can enter into saline combinations. Chenevix's findings helped to better understand the chemical properties and reactions of these acids.
