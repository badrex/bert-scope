tldr: The author examines the anatomy and evolutionary relationships of the thecodont reptile Euparkeria capensis, using specimens from Aliwal North, South Africa. They provide a detailed description of the reptile's skeleton and discuss its functional features, such as skull architecture, limbs, and vertebral column. Euparkeria is considered a progressive form closely related to the Erythrosuchidae family, possibly ancestral to advanced pseudosuchians like Ornithosuchus and Hesperosuchus, and may have been part of the lineage leading to prosauropods, sauropods, and even birds.
