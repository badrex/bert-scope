tldr: This article discusses a meeting held in 1993 that focused on understanding sedimentary geochemical processes through quantitative analysis. The meeting aimed to review the qualitative understandings of diagenesis and identify areas where further research is needed. Topics covered include the effects of climate change on sedimentary input, microbial processes, and the role of diagenetic concretions in the sedimentary record.
