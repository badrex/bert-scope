semantic_tags:
  - Adsorption
  - Colloidal systems
  - Surface chemistry
  - Heterogeneous reactions
  - Chemical kinetics
tldr: 'The author discusses the properties of colloidal systems and the role of adsorption in heterogeneous reactions. Adsorption is the process where substances accumulate at the interface between two phases in a system, and it plays a crucial role in the rate of chemical reactions. The author explains the stages of heterogeneous reactions, including diffusion, adsorption, and chemical reaction, and provides examples of colloidal systems and adsorption compounds.'
