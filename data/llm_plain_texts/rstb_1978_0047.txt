tldr: This article proposes a supersolenoid model for the structure of eukaryotic chromosomes, suggesting that human mitotic chromatids are based on the folding and coiling of a long, regular, hollow cylindrical structure called the unit fibre. The authors also study isolated chromosomes from mouse and Drosophila cells, finding similar structures with a diameter of about 400 nm. They estimate the DNA contraction within the unit fibre to be around 1400 times, and discuss the possibility of a single helical coiling to achieve the final contraction.
