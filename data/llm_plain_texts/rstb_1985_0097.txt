revised_title: 'Reevaluation of Phototropic Activity in Human Photoreceptors'
semantic_tags:
  - Phototropism
  - Retinal photoreceptors
  - Stiles-Crawford effect
  - Corneal physiology
  - Patching experiment
tldr: The authors reevaluate the interpretation of a previous study on phototropic activity in human photoreceptors. They discovered a failure of communication and a misunderstanding of corneal physiology, leading to incorrect results. The overall conclusion that a phototropic effect is present in human retinal photoreceptors remains unchanged, but the specific interpretation of the Stiles-Crawford effect is withdrawn. Further research is needed to clarify the role of corneal oedema and light leakage in the observed effects.
