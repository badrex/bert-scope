tldr: The authors investigate the dissolution of calcite in aqueous solutions at pH greater than 7 using a flow cell experimental method. They develop a numerical computational method to model the dissolution kinetics and analyze the surface concentrations of reactants, which helps in understanding the mechanism of calcite dissolution under high pH conditions.
