tldr: 'The study investigates the process of acetate oxidation and dissimilatory sulfate reduction in Desulfobacter postgatei, a type of sulfur bacteria. The research shows that acetate is oxidized to CO2 through the citric acid cycle, with the synthesis of pyruvate from acetyl CoA and CO2 as an anaplerotic reaction. The study also explains why methane formation from acetate is inhibited by sulfate in natural habitats, due to the lower Ks for acetate of the sulfate reducer.'
