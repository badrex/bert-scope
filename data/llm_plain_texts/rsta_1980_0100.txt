tldr: This article discusses non-equilibrium segregation in metals and alloys, which occurs when solute atoms and point defects accumulate at interfaces during cooling, irradiation, and sintering. The phenomenon affects the deformation, fracture, and mechanical properties of materials, as well as their corrosion behavior and structural stability. The article summarizes the current understanding of the mechanisms and kinetics of non-equilibrium segregation and suggests methods to inhibit segregation.
