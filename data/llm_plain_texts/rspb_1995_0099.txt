revised_title: 'Exploring the Dynamics of Vertically and Horizontally Transmitted Parasites'

  - Infection prevalence
tldr: The authors analyze a model of a parasite transmitted both vertically and horizontally, showing that the equilibrium prevalence of infection can be much higher than with either form alone. They find that for virulent pathogens, high observed numbers of vertically acquired cases suggest that horizontal transmission rates are high, rather than low.
