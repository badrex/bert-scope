tldr: The authors study the effective sink strength of a random array of voids in irradiated material. They define the sink strength and provide a variational characterization of the problem. The authors analyze the problem using a finite body and estimate the sink strength through a variational principle. They compare their results with self-consistent calculations and perturbation theory, demonstrating the sensitivity of the sink strength to the statistics of the void distribution.
