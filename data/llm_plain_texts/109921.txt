tldr: The author, Theodore de Saussure, conducted experiments on the decomposition of starch and its transformation into sugar, gum, and a substance called amidine. He observed that when starch is boiled in water, it forms sugar and a gum similar to that produced by roasting starch. The presence or absence of air affects the production of water and carbon dioxide during the process. The author also discussed the fixation of elements in the treatment of animal and vegetable substances and the changes in oils and fats during saponification.
