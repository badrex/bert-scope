tldr: The authors conducted experiments with a double canal-ray source to study the effects of crossed electric and magnetic fields on the helium spectrum. They observed that the selection rule dm = 0, +1 is now extended, and transitions occur for which | | = 2. The findings provide insights into the behavior of levels and intensities in the helium spectrum under the influence of electric and magnetic fields.
