tldr: The study investigates the effects of lanthanum on renin secretion and renal vasoconstriction in rats. Lanthanum was found to inhibit vasoconstriction due to noradrenaline but not renin release, which remained even in the presence of potent stimulators like isoprenaline and glucagon. The inhibition was overcome by using EDTA, suggesting that EDTA binds with lanthanum and removes it from membrane sites. The results provide insights into the relationship between smooth muscle contraction and renin secretion.
