revised_title: Micromechanical Investigation of Interfacial Transport Processes
semantic_tags:
  - Interfacial transport
  - Conservation equations
  - Microscale and macroscale analysis
  - Surface-excess properties
  - Fluid dynamics
tldr: The authors investigate interfacial transport processes using singular perturbation analysis and order of magnitude scaling relations. They develop interfacial conservation equations and discuss surface-excess properties, providing a framework for understanding mass transfer and fluid dynamics in interfacial transition regions.
