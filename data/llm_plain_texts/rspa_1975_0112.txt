tldr: This article explores the quasi-normal modes of the Schwarzschild black hole, which are solutions of the perturbation equations that satisfy boundary conditions for outgoing and ingoing waves. The study focuses on the potential barriers and their relevance to black hole physics, using a one-dimensional wave equation and a Riccati equation to obtain numerical solutions.
