tldr: The authors present an analytical investigation of estimating linearized oil-film coefficients in journal bearings. They use the principle of structural identifiability to compare and define the conditions required for estimating coefficients using various test signals. The study demonstrates the limitations of traditional methods and shows how these limitations can be overcome by using pseudo-random binary sequence forcing. The authors emphasize the importance of parameter estimation without prejudging the significance of coefficients and suggest using modern parameter estimation techniques for better results.
