tldr: 'The authors studied the structure and properties of rat thymus deoxyribonucleoprotein using electric birefringence and centrifugation techniques. They found that dilutions of the gel contained a substantial gel phase and that the birefringence properties of the solution phase were similar to those of unfractionated solutions at the same concentration. The results suggest that aging is a process of denaturation, occurring more rapidly in shaken solutions than in controls. The study provides insights into the structure and stability of deoxyribonucleoprotein, a main constituent of chromosomes.'
