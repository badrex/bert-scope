tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the contrast, breadths, and relative intensities of electron diffraction rings in iron specimens. They developed a theoretical relationship between the peak contrast, crystallite size, specimen thickness, amorphous content, and electron mean free path. The results showed that the highest contrast is obtained in single scattering conditions, and the contrast is independent of specimen thickness and accelerating voltage. The effect of plural electron scattering on ring breadths and intensities was also measured, and it was found that broadening is caused by very small angle scattering of diffracted electrons. The relative ring intensities were unaffected even when the proportion of scattered electrons within the ring profiles was large.
