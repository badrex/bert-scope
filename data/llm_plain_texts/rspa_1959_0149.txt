tldr: The author proposes a unified model for K- and mesons based on a non-linear meson field theory. The model describes the meson fields in terms of collective motions and interactions with the nucleon field. The masses and coupling constants of the mesons are determined by a universal coupling constant and a cut-off. The model also suggests a natural way to introduce the'spurion' for weak interactions that violate strangeness.
