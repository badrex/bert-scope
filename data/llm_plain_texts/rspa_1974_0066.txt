tldr: This study investigates the erosion of kaolinite clay by flowing water, focusing on the effects of temperature, salinity, and particle size. The experiments use pure kaolinite minerals and controlled water conditions to understand the complex interactions between these factors and the erosion process. The results indicate that temperature plays a significant role in pure water, while its influence decreases with increasing salinity and decreasing particle size. The study emphasizes the importance of closely controlled experiments to advance the understanding of cohesive soil erosion.
