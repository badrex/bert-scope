tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the velocity and absorption of ultrasonic waves in halo-ethylene vapours, such as vinyl fluoride, chloride, bromide, and iodide. They found that all these vapours show dispersion or incipient dispersion, and a single relaxation time controls the molecular vibrational energy in each case. The results are correlated with previous findings for other polyatomic molecules, and the authors conclude that vibrational activation enters a molecule via the mode of lowest frequency.
