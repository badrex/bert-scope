tldr: The authors explore asymmetric solutions in reaction-diffusion equations, specifically the Bratu problem, with convection as an additional heat transport mechanism. They find new non-symmetric solutions and demonstrate that these solutions remain connected as convection is increased. The quenching effect of convection reduces the sharp temperature gradients, making limit points less sensitive to grid refinement.
