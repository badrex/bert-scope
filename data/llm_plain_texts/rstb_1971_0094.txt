tldr: This article discusses the active transport of salts and water in avian salt glands, focusing on the processes at the apical and basal cell membranes during the formation of hypertonic sodium chloride secretion in marine birds. The concentration gradient is established across the apical membrane, likely by a sodium pump. The article also explores the role of acetylcholine in initiating secretion and the possible effects of hormones on the secretory mechanism.
