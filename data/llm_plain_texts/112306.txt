tldr: The author, Henry Clifton Sorby, investigates the correlation between mechanical and chemical forces, particularly the effect of pressure on the solubility of salts in water. He found that pressure can influence the solubility of salts, with mechanical force being directly correlated to chemical action. This discovery contributes to the understanding of the correlation of physical forces.
