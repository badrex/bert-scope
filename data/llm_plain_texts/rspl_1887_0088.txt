tldr: This article discusses the chemical properties of the secretions of the nephridia and the so-called "liver" of Patella vulgata, a type of limpet. The author also investigates the composition of sewer air and its potential sources of impurities. The study of the limpet's organs helps to understand their functions, while the sewer air analysis provides insights into the ventilation and cleanliness of public spaces.
