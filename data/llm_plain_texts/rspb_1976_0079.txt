revised_title: 'Strophanthidin's Effect on Sodium Efflux in Dialyzed Axons'
semantic_tags:

  - Ion exchange
tldr: The study examines the effect of strophanthidin on sodium efflux in dialyzed axons. It shows that the efflux depends on the external cation composition and suggests that strophanthidin induces a monovalent cation/Na exchange. The results indicate that ATP is required for the Na-Ca exchange.
