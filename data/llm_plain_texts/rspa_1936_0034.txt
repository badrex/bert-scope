tldr: The author examines the foundations of dynamics in the context of the universe's expansion, considering the effects of the distribution of matter on the motion of particles. They propose a model for the smoothed-out distribution of matter and discuss the acceleration of free particles in the presence of this distribution. The author also explores the implications of this model on the concept of external forces and the dynamics of constrained particles.
