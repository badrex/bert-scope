tldr: The article provides a detailed account of the illness and post-mortem observations of the late Rev. James Bradley, Astronomer Royal. His illness involved a suppression of urine, inflammation in the abdomen, and kidney issues. The post-mortem revealed inflamed intestines, an enlarged and indurated prostate gland, and soft, matter-filled kidneys. This rare case study sheds light on the understanding of kidney diseases and inflammation during that time.
