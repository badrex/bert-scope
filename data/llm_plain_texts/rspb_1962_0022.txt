tldr: 'This study examines the effects of drugs on bacterial growth and the nucleic acid-protein content of \lt;italic\gt;Bact\lt; /italic\gt;. \lt;italic\gt;lactis aerogenes\lt; /italic\gt;. The results show that drugs cause changes in cell size, growth patterns, and nucleic acid-protein content. When bacteria are returned to a drug-free medium, some of these changes persist or show an overshoot phenomenon. The findings suggest that the systems in the cells are interdependent and loosely linked, with phase relations being disturbed by abnormal conditions.'
