tldr: The authors investigate the ancient ecological diversification that explains life-history variation among living birds. They find that over 90% of the variation in key life-history traits occurs among lineages corresponding to the phylogenetic level of families or above, suggesting that variation among living species is due to events in the ancient evolutionary history of birds. The study identifies nesting habit as the primary ecological factor correlated with ancient changes in reproductive effort, with the adoption of safe nest sites being associated with reduced reproductive effort.
