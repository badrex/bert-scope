tldr: The authors investigated the electron properties of tellurium and found that its electrical conductivity increases with the addition of small amounts of foreign metals. They also discovered that the increase in conductivity is not proportional to the specific conductivity of the added metal. This study provides insights into the behavior of tellurium and its potential applications in semiconductors and thermoelectric materials.
