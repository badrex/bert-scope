tldr: The authors develop a method to define gauge-independent angular momentum in general relativity by treating it as a Yang-Mills theory based on Lorentz invariance. They derive six spin currents and a Gauss theorem for integrated charges, which are calculated using two-surface integrals at future null infinity. The authors also introduce a new twistor structure and discuss the radiation of spin via electromagnetic and gravitational waves.
