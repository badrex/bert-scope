tldr: The authors investigated the oestrogenic substances produced during the demethylation of anethole. They discovered that the demethylation process resulted in the formation of dihydro-dianols, which had double the oestrogenic activity of the original, partly unsaturated fraction. The researchers synthesized six possible isomers and identified the diphenylethane structure as the most active compound. This discovery led to the isolation of 4,4'-dihydroxy-y:Î±-diphenylhexane, which was found to be the substance responsible for the high oestrogenic activity in the anethole by-products.
