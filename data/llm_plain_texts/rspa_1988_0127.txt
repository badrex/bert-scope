tldr: The authors used Raman spectroscopy and the maximum entropy method to study the electron-phonon coupling in a Y-Ba-Cu-oxide superconductor. They found significant enhancement of Raman activity and low-temperature ordering of copper ions in the lattice below the superconducting transition temperature. This study provides insights into the underlying mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity in these materials.
