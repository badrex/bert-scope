tldr: The author used interference bands to measure the growth rate of trees. They discovered that tree growth is closely related to temperature, with the most rapid growth occurring when the temperature is lowest. Rain also has a significant effect on tree growth, as it can both mechanically swell the bark and reduce evaporation from the leaves.
