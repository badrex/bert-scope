tldr: The author observed a unique rainbow-like phenomenon called an 'Iris' in Chester and later in London streets. The Iris had three concentric arches with inverted colors compared to a regular rainbow. The author explained the phenomenon as a result of sunlight being reflected from the River Dee and raindrops in the streets. This uncommon sight led the author to further study and understanding of the nature of rainbows.
