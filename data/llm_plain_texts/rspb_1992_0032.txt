tldr: The study investigates the distribution of calcium currents in cultured leech neurons and how it changes after the formation of a synapse. Researchers found that calcium currents in the stumps of Retzius cells were three times larger than in the middle part of the soma. After the formation of chemical synapses, calcium currents at the stumps of postsynaptic cells and in the polar region of the somas of presynaptic cells were reduced. The loose-patch clamp technique was used to record calcium currents along the cell surfaces of several neurons.
