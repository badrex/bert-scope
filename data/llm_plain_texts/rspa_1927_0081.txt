tldr: This study investigates the properties of brass crystals made from a copper-zinc alloy. The author conducts tensile tests on these crystals and observes the formation of slip-bands and slip-planes. The results show that the deformation occurs by slip on one plane, and the direction of slip is consistent with previous findings on copper and aluminum. The author also discusses the factors responsible for this type of deformation, such as shear-stress on the slip-plane.
