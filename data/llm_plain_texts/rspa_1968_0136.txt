tldr: The authors studied the effects of bromine compounds on the thermal degradation of polyolefins, such as polyethylene, polypropylene, and a polyethylene-polypropylene copolymer. They found that the presence of bromine accelerates the degradation of polypropylene and the copolymer while retarding the breakdown of polyethylenes with a small degree of branching. The results can be explained by a mechanism involving bromine atoms as chain carriers, with the different rates of thermal degradation being due to the more facile abstraction of hydrogen from tertiary than secondary C-H groups.
