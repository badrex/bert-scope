tldr: Humphry Davy conducted experiments on the Torpedo's electrical organ to understand its similarities and differences with Voltaic electricity. He found that the shocks from the Torpedo did not decompose water or affect a magnetic needle, suggesting that animal electricity might be a distinctive and peculiar form of electricity. The connection between animal electricity and the nervous system could lead to important discoveries in physiology.
