  - Flow stability
tldr: The authors examine the stability of parallel flows with parallel magnetic fields, focusing on the effects of electromagnetic forces and the interaction of disturbances with the mean flow. They demonstrate that three-dimensional disturbances are generally the most unstable and that a parallel magnetic field can never completely stabilize a parallel flow.
