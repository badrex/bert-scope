  - High-speed flow
  - Pressure distribution
tldr: The authors conducted experiments using service time-fuzes as manometers to measure the dynamic pressure on the heads of shells moving at high velocities. They determined the relation between dynamic pressure, shell velocity, and atmospheric conditions, which could help in understanding the resistance of a compressible fluid at high speeds.
