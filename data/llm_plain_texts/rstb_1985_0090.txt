tldr: This article discusses the evolution and environment in the late Silurian and early Devonian period. It highlights the importance of refining the stratigraphical framework for better correlation and recognition of synchronous events. The transition from marine to non-marine environments and the colonization of terrestrial areas are also addressed. The article emphasizes the diachronism in the cessation of marine conditions and its impact on biotic evolution.
