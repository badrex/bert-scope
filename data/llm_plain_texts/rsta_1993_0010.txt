tldr: The article discusses the process of melt production in mantle plumes and its impact on the Earth's lithosphere. It explains how factors such as mantle temperature, lithospheric thickness, and decompression rate affect melt production. The article also explores the distribution of the resulting melt in the crust and its implications for the formation of volcanic features and flood basalts.
