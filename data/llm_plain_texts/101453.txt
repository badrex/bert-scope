tldr: The author describes an experiment to infuse colors into marble, allowing pictures drawn on the surface to appear throughout the stone. The process involves using a mixture of chemicals, including aqua fortis, aqua regis, sal armoniack, and spirit of wine, to create colored waters that can be applied to marble. The resulting colored marble can be cut into multiple pieces, revealing the same image on both sides. This technique was later practiced by a stone cutter in Oxford named Mr. Bird.
