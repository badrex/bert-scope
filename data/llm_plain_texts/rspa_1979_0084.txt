tldr: This article explores the behavior of solitons in a rotating baroclinic fluid, demonstrating how the nonlinear evolution of wave packets can be described by the sine-Gordon equation. The authors show that soliton solutions exist in this system, which has implications for understanding atmospheric and oceanic dynamics and interpreting laboratory experiments with rotating fluids.
