tldr: The author examines the contents of hepatic ducts and discovers hepatic cells in smaller ducts. They conclude that these cells are analogous to the endogenous cells of other glands, such as the pancreas, and play a role in the production of bile. This study provides insight into the anatomical and physiological relationship between hepatic cells and the hepatic ducts.
