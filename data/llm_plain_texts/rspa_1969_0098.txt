tldr: The authors modify the Firsov theory of electronic stopping to explain the oscillatory dependence on ionic atomic numbers observed in recent experiments. They replace the Thomas-Fermi atom with Hartree-Fock wave functions, allowing for different ionic sizes. The modified theory predicts stopping cross-sections for ions in amorphous carbon and channelled ions in silicon, providing a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms.
