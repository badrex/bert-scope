tldr: This article discusses the turbulent suspension of sediments in the deep sea, focusing on observations made during the High-Energy Benthic Boundary Layer Experiment (HEBBLE). The authors describe the dynamics of erosion events and the suspended sediment field, and they develop a time-dependent model to recreate the effects of local storms. They also explore the role of sediment-induced stratification in the growth of the near-bed turbulence-supported nepheloid layer and discuss the applicability of various closure models to benthic sediment transport storms.
