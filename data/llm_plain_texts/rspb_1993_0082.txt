tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the squid giant axon to study the properties of the voltage sensor responsible for the opening and closing of sodium channels. They found that the voltage sensor carries 0.8 electronic charges and its equilibrium potential is shifted by inactivation. The results support the idea that the S4 voltage-sensing units are responsible for the transitions between resting, activated, and inactivated states, while a separate C^O voltage sensor controls the transitions to and from the open states. Inactivation involves conformational changes that lower the probability of opening by shifting the equilibrium potential of the C^O voltage sensor to a more positive value.
