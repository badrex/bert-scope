tldr: The author presents a study on Riemann problems and the weighted average flux (WAF) method for solving the two-dimensional shallow water equations. They discuss various test problems and approximate Riemann solvers, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the WAF method in simulating flow situations with abrupt changes or nonlinear effects.
