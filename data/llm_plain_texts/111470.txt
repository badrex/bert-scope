tldr: This article focuses on the development of the theory of binary quantics, specifically the covariants and invariants of the degrees 2, 3, and 4. It also introduces the concepts of catalecticant, lambdaic, canonisant, Bezoutiants, and Cobezoutiants, which are functions and derivatives connected to binary quantic theories. The author aims to provide precise definitions for these terms and complete the explanation of the terminology in this area of study.
