tldr: The author examines the brain and skull of the fish Amphioxus lanceolatus, revealing similarities to higher vertebrates. They argue that despite the absence of differentiated brain and skull, Amphioxus possesses well-defined divisions of the cerebro-spinal nervous axis and spinal column. This study contributes to understanding the evolution of vertebrates and suggests that Amphioxus represents a primary division of the class Pisces, called Entomocrania.
