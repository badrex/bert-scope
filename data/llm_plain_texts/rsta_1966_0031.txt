tldr: This article discusses the deformation of solids by high-speed liquid impact and its relation to various technical problems, such as rain damage in aircraft and missiles, blade erosion in steam turbines, and cavitation erosion. The authors describe a method for producing high-velocity liquid jets and study the impact pressure, deformation, and tangential flow of the liquid on solid surfaces. They also explore the consequences of high pressures, such as the impact flash and the formation of annular fractures in solids.
