tldr: This article examines the post-glacial history of British vegetation, focusing on the Fenland region. The authors use pollen analysis to study the changes in forest composition and land and sea-level changes in the area. They identify three phases of dryness followed by sudden increases in wetness, which led to the development and destruction of fen woods. The study provides valuable insights into the environmental history of the Fenland region.
