tldr: This paper presents a kinetic theory for wave propagation in extensive random media, focusing on energy transfer processes. The proposed theory satisfies energy conservation and the Second Law of Thermodynamics, and is illustrated through three problems involving transmission through a slab, scattering theory of geometrical optics, and scattering by a randomly inhomogeneous half-space.
