tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the discharge of electricity through gases and the effects of electrification on surfaces. They discovered that a steady current of electricity can be obtained in air from electrodes at a low difference of potential when an independent current is maintained in the same closed vessel. This finding challenges the idea of a finite difference of potential between a gas and a metal in contact.
