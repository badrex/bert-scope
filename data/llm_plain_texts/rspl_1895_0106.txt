tldr: The authors conducted experiments on animals to study the effects of partial thyroidectomy. They found that leaving one parathyroid gland was enough for the animal to survive, and the remaining thyroid tissue hypertrophied and changed its secretion. The results showed similarities to the enlarged goitre in Graves' disease. This research provided insights into the thyroid gland's functions and the role of parathyroids in maintaining animal health.
