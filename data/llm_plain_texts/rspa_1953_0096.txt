tldr: The authors studied the benzoyl peroxide catalyzed copolymerization of vinyl and vinylidene chlorides. They found that the rate of copolymerization increases during the reaction, and the percentage increase in rate varies with the solubility of the copolymer formed. The authors developed a method to determine the rates at which individual monomers enter the copolymer, which helps to understand the reaction kinetics better. The results show that the rate of copolymerization is reduced to a minimum value when using pure monomers and increases as the monomer composition changes.
