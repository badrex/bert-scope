tldr: The author investigates the role of proteids in blood coagulation, specifically focusing on the proteins found in lymphatic glands. They discovered that certain proteids, such as mucin-like proteid, cell globulin, and cell albumin, play a crucial role in the coagulation process. The study also found that the fibrin ferment, which is responsible for converting fibrinogen into fibrin, is present in both fresh and dried gland extracts. This research provides a deeper understanding of blood coagulation and the factors involved in the process.
