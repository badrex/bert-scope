tldr: The authors measured the oscillator strengths and wavelengths of 98 spectral lines in neutral scandium using a heat pipe and the hook method. They determined the absolute scale of the oscillator strengths based on the measurements of Bell and Lyzenga and compared their values to those in the literature. This study provides a comprehensive dataset for understanding scandium's atomic transitions and improving the accuracy of its spectral analysis.
