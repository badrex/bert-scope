tldr: The study investigates the ingestion of dietary protein as large molecular mass degradation products in adult rats. It found that proteins fed orally to adult rats are transported into the circulation in the form of breakdown products. The research also discovered that prior oral doses can affect the uptake of these breakdown products, with preliminary oral immunization reducing their passage. This has implications for the physiology and immunology of ingestion.
