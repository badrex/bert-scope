tldr: 'In this report, Mr. Sturges and Dr. Heberden describe the observation of two primary rainbows and their secondary bows on July 9, 1792, at Alverstoke, Hampshire. The rainbows appeared due to the sun shining while a thunderstorm cloud produced the rain. The primary rainbows were not concentric but touched each other, with a secondary bow to each. The phenomenon was studied and explained in terms of light reflection and the position of the sun and the cloud.'
