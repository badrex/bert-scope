tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the scattering of beta-rays from uranium when passing through various materials. They found that the scattering of beta-rays is influenced by the atomic structure of the material and can be represented by a mathematical equation. This research provided insights into the interactions between subatomic particles and atoms, which is essential for understanding nuclear physics.
