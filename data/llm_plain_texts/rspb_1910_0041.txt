tldr: Researchers conducted experiments to determine if cattle can act as a reservoir for the virus of sleeping sickness (Trypanosoma gambiense). They found that cattle can be infected with sleeping sickness through subcutaneous injections of blood containing the virus, bites of artificially-infected tsetse flies, and bites of naturally-infected flies. Additionally, they discovered that tsetse flies can be infected by feeding on cattle with sleeping sickness and can then transmit the disease to healthy animals. This study is important for understanding the spread of sleeping sickness and potential ways to control it.
