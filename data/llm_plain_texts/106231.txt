tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effects of tar, lamp-black, and oil on the conduction of electricity, particularly in relation to lightning. They discovered that these substances can act as insulators, preventing damage to wooden structures and ships during lightning strikes. However, they also found that objects close to these insulators may still be at risk of being struck by lightning.
