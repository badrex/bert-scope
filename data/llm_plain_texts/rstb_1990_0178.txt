tldr: The authors developed deterministic models to study the kinetics of 2,4-D degradation in soil based on different microbial processes and populations. They found that at low concentrations, degradation results from maintenance consumption by a large fraction of the soil microbial population, while at high concentrations, there is a growth-associated carbon incorporation by a small specific microbial population. The models help in understanding the fate of pesticides in the soil and their potential impact on the environment.
