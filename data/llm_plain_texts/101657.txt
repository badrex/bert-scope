tldr: The author describes a method for making plants, trees, fruits, flowers, and legumes grow to an extraordinary size. The secret lies in sowing seeds and planting kernels at the time of the vernal equinox and transplanting them during a full moon. The author also provides a way to determine the exact moment of the equinox using ashes of vine-wood and water. This method, though seemingly improbable, is worth trying for its potential benefits in agriculture.
