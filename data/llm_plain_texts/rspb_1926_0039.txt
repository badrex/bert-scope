tldr: This study compares the properties of turacin and hematin, two pigments found in living organisms. The research focuses on understanding the relationship between the pigments' physico-chemical state and their absorption spectrum. The findings have important implications for the study of cytochrome, a widely distributed respiratory pigment. The study reveals that turacin and hematin have two distinct main types of absorption spectra, type A and type B, which vary depending on their chemical composition and state of dispersion.
