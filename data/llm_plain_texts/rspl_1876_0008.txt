tldr: The authors discuss the calculation of shot trajectories and resistance, focusing on the work of Bashforth and the importance of accurate methods for determining ranges in gunnery. They present a mathematical model for calculating the trajectory of a shot and demonstrate its application with an example of a 38-ton gun.
