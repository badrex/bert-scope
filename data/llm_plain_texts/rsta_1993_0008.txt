tldr: The authors conducted a series of melting experiments on peridotite KLB-1 to study the conditions of mantle melting and the origin of basaltic magmas. They determined accurate phase diagrams for the peridotite at various pressures and temperatures, and their findings support the hypothesis that mid-ocean ridge basalts are partial melting products of mantle peridotite. Island arc picritic tholeiites may also be considered partial melts of a peridotitic source, while primary magmas for Hawaiian tholeiites are difficult to produce by partial melting of typical mantle peridotite under anhydrous conditions.
