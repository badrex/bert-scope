tldr: This article discusses various methods of illuminating lighthouses and introduces a new method using a ball or cylinder of lime, ignited by hydrogen gas, to create a constant light. The author compares this method to existing techniques, such as using Argand lamps with parabolic reflectors or glass lenses, and suggests that it offers advantages in terms of economy and ease of management.
