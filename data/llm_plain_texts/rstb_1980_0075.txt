tldr: Researchers discuss the potential of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in detecting malignant tumors, particularly in breast cancer. They explore the differences in relaxation times between healthy and cancerous tissues and the challenges in accurately measuring these differences. The authors also consider the limitations of current imaging techniques and the need for further research to improve the sensitivity and specificity of NMR in detecting early-stage cancer.
