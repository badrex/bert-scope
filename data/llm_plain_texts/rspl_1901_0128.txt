tldr: This article examines the micro-crystalline structure of platinum through a detailed analysis of its section using various etching processes and microscopy techniques. The author discovers that the structure is allotriomorphic, derived from a system of interfering cubes and octahedra, and shares similarities with the structures of gold and silver. The size of the crystal grains varies, and the author also observes minute triangular crystals, which are likely developments from the cutting of certain crystals in section.
