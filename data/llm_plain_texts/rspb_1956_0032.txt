tldr: The article investigates the growth-promoting effects of insulin and growth hormone in hypophysectomized and diethylstilboestrol-treated rats, as well as in rats fed 2-4-dinitrophenol. The results show that insulin has no growth-promoting effect in rats with growth inhibited by diethylstilboestrol, but hypophyseal growth hormone stimulates growth in these rats. Combined treatment with growth hormone and insulin results in an enhanced rate of growth. In hypophysectomized rats, insulin has growth-promoting properties, and cortisone acetate inhibits growth in insulin-treated hypophysectomized rats. 2-4-dinitrophenol prevents growth and increases nitrogen excretion in young rats, but combined treatment with insulin, growth hormone, and glucose induces growth and brings about positive nitrogen balance in dinitrophenol-poisoned rats.
