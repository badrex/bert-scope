tldr: This study investigates the effect of infra-red radiation on the combustion rate of inflammable gaseous mixtures, such as hydrogen, carbon-monoxide, and methane combined with air. The researchers used two types of experimental setups to examine the influence of radiation on the rate of combustion. They found that radiation from a heated coil increased the combustion rate of carbon-monoxide and air mixtures, but had no effect on hydrogen and air mixtures. The results suggest that the type of radiation and the gaseous mixture play a significant role in the combustion process.
