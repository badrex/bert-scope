tldr: The study examines the correlation between the size of the Graafian follicle at ovulation and the body weight of different mammal species. The research found that the size of the follicle when the ovum is fully grown does not determine the size of the follicle at ovulation, and the size of the mature follicle is not affected by the number of follicles produced in the ovary at one time. The study also found that the size of the fully grown ovum does not have a correlation with the body weight of the species or with the ultimate size attained by the follicle.
