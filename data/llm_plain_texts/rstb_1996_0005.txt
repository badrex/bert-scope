tldr: The study investigates the color and pattern polymorphism in the spittlebug Philaenus spumarius across England and Wales. The genetic control of this polymorphism involves seven alleles at a single autosomal locus. The research finds that urban areas have a higher mean frequency of melanic phenotypes compared to rural areas, suggesting an 'urban effect' on morph frequencies. The study also highlights the complex dominance hierarchy and variable expression of melanic genes in males, which varies between populations.
