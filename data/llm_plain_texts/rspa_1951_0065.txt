tldr: This study investigates the infra-red spectra of various fibrous proteins, such as silk suture, porcupine quill, elephant hair, swan quill, gelatine, and rat-tail tendon. The authors discovered that these proteins contain both extended and folded peptide chains, and they propose a method of folding a peptide chain that accounts for the infra-red and X-ray spectra of collagen and gelatine. The findings provide valuable information about the orientation of individual valency bonds in fibrous proteins, complementing X-ray observations.
