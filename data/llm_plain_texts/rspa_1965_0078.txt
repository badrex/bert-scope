tldr: The article explores the derivation of Green-type, transitional, and uniform asymptotic expansions from differential equations for the confluent hypergeometric function U(a, c, z) when |c| is large. The author applies methods introduced in previous works and studies the general exponential integral as a special case. The article provides expansions for solutions of the confluent hypergeometric equation, which are valid in various regions, including the transitional region where the Green-type expansions break down.
