tldr: The author's experiments showed that oxygen in the air combines with the blood during respiration, contrary to Magnus's theory that gases enter into no chemical combination with blood. The study found that blood combines with oxygen in two ways: by giving off carbon and directly combining with oxygen. This research supports the idea that the blood's color, hematin, plays a significant role in absorbing oxygen and exhaling carbon dioxide, which is different from Liebig's hypothesis that iron in the blood-hematin is responsible for this process.
