tldr: This article presents a probabilistic analysis of the tensile strength of hybrid fiber composites, considering the breaking strains of different fiber types as statistical variables. The authors develop a theoretical model to predict the stress-strain relationship of the composite and perform a comprehensive parametric study to understand the relationships between composite breaking behavior and fiber and composite interfacial properties. The hybrid effects are discussed, revealing various factors causing these effects and their impact on composite behavior.
