tldr: The article investigates the interaction between the HIV-1 gp120 protein and the CD4 receptor using chimeras of rat and human CD4. The study finds that residues 33-62 of the CD4 receptor encompass the high-affinity gp120 binding site, and chimeras containing these residues mediate HIV-1 infection. The research also tests the popular notion that receptor mimics appear frequently among antibodies elicited by immunization with receptor ligands and the use of anti-idiotypic antibodies to identify new receptors, suggesting that such mimics appear infrequently.
