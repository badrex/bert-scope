tldr: This article examines the Araucarieae family, specifically the genera Agathis and Araucaria, to understand their primitive characteristics and phylogenetic relationships. The study covers various aspects, including seedlings, stem anatomy, leaf structure, reproductive shoots, and fossil records. The authors argue for the Araucariales designation to reflect the family's isolated position within the Coniferales and suggest that Araucarieae may have been derived from Lycopodiaceous ancestors.
