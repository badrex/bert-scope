tldr: The authors studied the time and duration of female meiosis in wheat, rye, and barley, comparing the stages of male and female development within individual florets. They found that the duration of female meiosis in Hordeum vulgare and Triticum aestivum was similar to the duration of male meiosis, while in Secale cereale, male meiosis preceded female meiosis by about 15 hours. Nuclear DNA content and ploidy level play a significant role in controlling the duration of female meiosis.
