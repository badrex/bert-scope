tldr: This article describes a spectroscopic method for accurately measuring small concentrations of lead in cerebrospinal fluid. The method is precise, requires minimal sample preparation, and can detect lead concentrations between 1 x 10^-8 and 2 x 10^-5 gm/cc. The authors discuss the underlying principles of this type of analysis.
