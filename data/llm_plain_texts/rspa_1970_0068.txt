tldr: The authors analyze the properties of random surfaces and their contact, focusing on the height distribution and autocorrelation function. They develop a model for a Gaussian height distribution and exponential autocorrelation function, which is used to study the distribution of asperities' heights and curvatures. This research has implications for understanding friction, wear, and other aspects of surfaces in contact.
