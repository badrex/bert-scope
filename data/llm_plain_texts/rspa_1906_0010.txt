tldr: 'Astronomers Percival Lowell and Norman Lockyer successfully captured the first photographs of the canals of Mars using the 24-inch refractor telescope at Lowell Observatory. They overcame challenges posed by atmospheric conditions and air-waves, which often blurred or obliterated delicate details. The photographs confirmed the existence of the canals as narrow, dark lines, supporting earlier eye observations.'
