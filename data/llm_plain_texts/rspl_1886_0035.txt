tldr: The authors conducted a study on the minute anatomy of the brachial plexus, examining the motor and sensory nerve supply to various muscles and areas of the arm. They discovered a set of rules that govern the arrangement of nerves based on the position and location of the muscles and skin spots. These rules help explain the distribution of nerves in the body and their functions.
