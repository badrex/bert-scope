tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the relationship between magnetic stress and magnetic deformation in nickel. They measured the magnetization and the effect of tension on magnetization for different field strengths and tensions using the ballistic method. The magnetic elongation of a long nickel wire was also measured for various field strengths and tensions. The results showed that the observed contraction was greater than the contraction calculated from the theory of stresses, and the difference between them was approximately proportional to the fourth power of the magnetization.
