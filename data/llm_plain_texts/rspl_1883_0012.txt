tldr: The author investigates the chemical changes that occur during the charging and discharging of storage batteries. They conclude that the main chemical change is the electrolysis of hexabasic sulfuric acid, which affects the positive and negative plates of the battery. The author also proposes a method to estimate the charge in a storage cell without discharging it.
