tldr: The authors present a general solution of Einstein's gravitational equations for systems involving three variables. They discuss the Cartesian ground-form in empty space, modified by the introduction of exponential factors, and interpret the perturbation as the result of introducing matter into the previously empty world. The solution is applicable to a wide range of problems and can be extended to higher-order approximations.
