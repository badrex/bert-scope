tldr: This study investigates the fast-slow continuum hypothesis in plant life histories, examining the relationship between adult mortality rates, age at sexual maturity, and fecundity in 83 species of perennial plants. The results show that plants with higher adult mortality rates have shorter lifespans and reach sexual maturity at an earlier age, aligning with the fast-slow continuum theory. However, the monotonically increasing fecundity in plants prevents testing the positive relationship between mortality and fecundity.
