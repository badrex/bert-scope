  - Animal Migration
tldr: The study investigates how mammals' breeding seasons change when transported to new latitudes. It shows that animals from tropical regions do not adjust their breeding seasons according to the new environment, while those from temperate regions reverse their breeding seasons. The research also highlights the role of external factors, such as light duration, in influencing the breeding periodicity of mammals.
