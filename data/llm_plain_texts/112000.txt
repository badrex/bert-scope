tldr: The author conducted experiments at Watford Tunnel to study the vibrations caused by railway trains passing through it. They observed that the vibrations were significant and could be detected up to 643 yards away from the tunnel. This research was important for understanding the potential impact of railway tremors on nearby establishments, such as the Royal Observatory in Greenwich.
