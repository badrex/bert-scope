tldr: This study investigates the effects of fatigue on highly skilled work, focusing on the central nervous system. The author argues that previous methods for studying fatigue, such as repetitive tasks, do not accurately represent the complex nature of skilled work. Instead, the study uses an experimental setup that mimics real-life situations, where subjects perform coordinated actions in response to a pattern of stimuli. The results show that as fatigue grows, the central nervous system's inhibitory activities relax, leading to an increase in errors and a decline in performance.
