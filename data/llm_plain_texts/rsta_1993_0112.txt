tldr: This article discusses the importance of destabilization in biological molecular recognition, emphasizing that weak binding interactions between small molecules and proteins are crucial for driving reactions and facilitating processes such as enzyme catalysis and coupled vectorial reactions. The author highlights the role of desolvation, physical distortion, and entropy loss in ground state destabilization, which enables the transition state to be reached more easily.
