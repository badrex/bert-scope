tldr: This study investigates how European starlings allocate food among nestlings and how sibling competition affects parental choice. The researchers manipulated the state of one target chick in each nest by placing it in different-sized broods before returning it to its original nest. They found that the target chick's begging intensity and position in the nest influenced its probability of being fed. The findings suggest that both begging and position should be considered in theoretical analyses of the evolution of food-solicitation signaling in birds.
