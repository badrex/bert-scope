tldr: The authors investigated the C-Br bond dissociation energy in various substituted benzyl bromides using the toluene-carrier technique. They found that the rate of decomposition for most of the compounds was a first-order reaction, and the differences in activation energies between substituted and unsubstituted benzyl bromides were determined. The study provides evidence supporting the assumption of constant frequency factors in similar reactions.
