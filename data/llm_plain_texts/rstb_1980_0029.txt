tldr: The author studied the ostracod fauna found in the interglacial deposits at Sugworth, Oxfordshire, and analyzed the environment in which they lived. The dominant species, Scottia browniana, suggests a temperate to warm-temperate climate during the middle of an interglacial period. The fauna indicates a Hoxnian or earlier age, which agrees with the evidence provided by plants and vertebrates. The environment was likely a sluggish stream with a tendency to stagnation and vegetation overgrowth, with occasional floodings.
