tldr: The authors analyze the effective Curie-Weiss constant of ferromagnetic metals and alloys, dividing them into two classes: those that follow a localized model and those that obey the intermediate model. They use experimental data to calculate the number of magnetic carriers and compare the results with the saturation magnetization. The study helps in understanding the behavior of ferromagnetic materials and choosing the appropriate theoretical approach for each substance.
