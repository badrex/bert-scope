tldr: The author conducted a series of experiments to study the relationship between light emission and absorption in various materials. They found that the blackened cylinders emitted light faster and brighter than the polished ones, suggesting that the absorption of light plays a significant role in the emission process. The author also observed that the temperature of the materials affected the light emission and absorption, and discussed the implications of these findings for understanding the nature of matter and its constituent parts.
