tldr: The authors present a method to calculate pore-size distributions in porous solids using physical adsorption of gases. They apply this method to Linde silica and Carbolac 1, comparing adsorption isotherms for loose powders and compressed porous plugs. The results provide evidence of tightly packed aggregates of particles and an increasing uniformity of pore size as porosity decreases.
