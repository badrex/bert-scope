tldr: This article discusses the effects of interrupting afferent and efferent tracts of the cerebellum. The author conducted experiments to understand if the cerebellum has a direct influence on spinal centers. The results showed that the cerebellum might be involved in sensory processes as well as motor control. The study also found that the direction of rotation and ocular displacements were related to the side of the lesion.
