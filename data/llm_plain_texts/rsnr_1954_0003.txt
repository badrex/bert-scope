tldr: This article examines the age distribution of fellows elected to the Royal Society from 1848 to 1953. It shows that the median age of election varies between scientific categories and discusses the implications of this for the purpose and function of the fellowship. The author suggests that the median age of election should be kept around forty-five to ensure a balance between experienced and younger candidates.
