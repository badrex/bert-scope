tldr: The authors present an exact solution to the magnetohydrodynamic stability problem of dissipative Couette flow between rotating cylinders under the influence of an axial magnetic field. They find the critical Taylor number for the onset of instability and provide a detailed analysis of the flow's stability with respect to perturbations of different wavenumbers. The results agree well with previous variational and Galerkin expansion techniques.
