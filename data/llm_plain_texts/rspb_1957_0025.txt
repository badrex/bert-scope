tldr: Researchers Edwards and Waddington successfully induced gynogenesis in mice by irradiating sperm with X-rays. Gynogenesis is a form of parthenogenesis, where offspring develop from an egg without fertilization. This study provides insight into the development of asexual reproduction in animals and potential applications in genetic research.
