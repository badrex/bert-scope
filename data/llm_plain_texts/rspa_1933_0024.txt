tldr: The authors conducted a study on the arc spectrum of iodine, analyzing its electron configuration and term values. They discovered that the normal coupling breaks down, and the authors classified the lines in the spectrum based on their findings. This research helped improve the understanding of iodine's atomic structure and its place in the periodic table.
