tldr: The authors discuss the incidence of infecundity and childlessness in marriages, analyzing data from a study of marriage, fertility, and birth control practices in Britain. They estimate that around 7-10% of marriages may be infecund, and discuss factors that may influence these rates, such as the use of birth control and changes in marriage patterns. They also compare their findings to those in the United States and consider the implications for future population growth.
