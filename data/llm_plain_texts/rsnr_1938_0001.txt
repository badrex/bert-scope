tldr: In 1937, Professor L. J. Henderson proposed an annual scientific lecture series between the Royal Society and the National Academy of Sciences. The Pilgrim Trust generously funded this initiative, which aimed to foster friendly contact between the two organizations. The first lecture was given by Dr. Irving Langmuir in London in 1938. If successful, the lecture series was expected to become a permanent institution.
