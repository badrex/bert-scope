tldr: The authors conducted a series of observations on the development of the posterior parts of the main systemic vessels in various mammals, including rats, mice, ferrets, cats, and sheep. They discovered that the primitive aortae are paired trunks that differentiate into the systemic aorta, the ventral part of the aortic arch, and the iliac and hypogastric arteries. This research provides a detailed understanding of the development and morphology of the vascular system in mammals.
