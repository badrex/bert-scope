tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the directive power of large steel magnets, magnetized soft iron bars, and galvanic coils on external small magnets. They investigated the magnetic force exerted by these objects and found that the directive force varies depending on the position of the magnet or coil. The results provide insights into the understanding of magnetic fields and the potential applications of galvanic currents.
