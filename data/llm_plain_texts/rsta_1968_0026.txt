  - Sound Attenuation
tldr: The authors discuss methods to control noise in industrial electrical machines, focusing on reducing noise at the source and attenuating it before reaching the observer. They explore various noise sources, such as magnetostriction, windage noise, and mechanical noise, and propose strategies for noise reduction, including enclosure design and vibration isolation.
