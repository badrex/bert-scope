tldr: The author, A.W. Hofmann, investigates the relationship between pressure and velocity in sound wave motion and explains the formation of a bore in the front of a wave. He also accounts for various previously unexplained phenomena related to sound transmission and provides a detailed analysis of a chemical reaction involving amylamine and bisulphide of carbon.
