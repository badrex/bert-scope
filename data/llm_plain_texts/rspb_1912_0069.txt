revised_title: 'Investigating the Appearance of Pure Spectral Colours After Eye Fatigue'
semantic_tags:
  - Color Perception
  - After-images
  - Visual Fatigue
  - Simultaneous Contrast
  - Spectral Colors
tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments to understand the appearance of pure spectral colors after the eye was fatigued by light of a specific wavelength. They discovered that the after-image's color and intensity depend on the intensity of the fatiguing light and the surrounding colors. The findings support the Edridge-Green theory of color vision and the concept of simultaneous contrast.'
