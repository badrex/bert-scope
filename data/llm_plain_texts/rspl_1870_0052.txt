tldr: Capt. Ivan Belavenetz, Director of the Imperial Magnetic Observatory, shares his magnetic observations made during a voyage to the North of Europe and the coasts of the Arctic Sea in the summer of 1870. He used a small compass and various instruments to measure magnetic declination, inclination, and horizontal force. The observations aimed to understand the magnetic disturbances and compare them with those made at the same time by photography at Kew. This information could help deduce the magnetic disturbance due to the change of magnetic latitude.
