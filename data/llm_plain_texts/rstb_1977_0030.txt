tldr: This article discusses the relationship between water structure and biopolymer conformational transitions in aqueous solutions. It explores three types of hydration behavior common to biopolymer systems: ionic hydration, specific hydration, and hydrophobic hydration. The study aims to understand how these interactions influence biopolymer conformational equilibria and the role of solvent perturbations in triggering biological processes.
