tldr: This article discusses the structure and development of bone, focusing on the Haversian system and the process of bone tissue regeneration. The authors describe the different types of canals and spaces in bones, as well as the lamination and laminae found in bone tissue. They also explain how older bone tissue is removed and replaced with new tissue, demonstrating the continuous process of bone regeneration throughout an individual's life.
