tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the extrinsic muscles of the eye and found that they contract under the influence of choline, acetylcholine, and nicotine. This is different from other voluntary muscles in mammals, which only contract after their motor nerves have degenerated. The findings suggest that the eye muscles may use an ancient and primitive mechanism that other voluntary muscles have lost.
