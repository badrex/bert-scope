tldr: The authors developed a new technique combining electron microscopy and energy analysis to study segregation and precipitation at grain boundaries in an aluminium 7 wt.% magnesium alloy. This technique uses energy loss information from transmitted electrons to analyze the distribution of magnesium atoms and reveal the presence of precipitates. The method provides a higher spatial resolution compared to other microanalysis systems, allowing for a more detailed investigation of the alloy's properties and behavior.
