tldr: The author, Rev. Samuel Haughton, investigates the Law of Fatigue and its application in animal mechanics. He conducts experiments on lifting weights at different rates of motion without rest, and compares the results with calculations from the Law of Fatigue. The author finds that fatigue occurs when the dynamical work multiplied by its rate, together with the statical work multiplied by its rate, is constant. This study helps to understand the relationship between work, rate of work, and muscle fatigue.
