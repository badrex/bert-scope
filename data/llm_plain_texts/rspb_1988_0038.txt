tldr: The authors present a model that couples the equations for membrane deformation with the chemical kinetics of adhesion molecules to study membrane-to-surface attachment and detachment. They propose a set of constitutive laws and derive an exact formula for the critical tension. The model predicts the occurrence of states where adhesion cannot be reversed by tension application and discusses the biological significance of such catch-bonds.
