tldr: This article discusses the impact of climate change on Antarctica's rock weathering, soil development, and colonization. As temperatures rise, ice cover melts, exposing more land to subaerial processes and increasing the debris supply to retreating glaciers. Thawing permafrost and a deeper active layer facilitate weathering, pedogenesis, and colonization processes. The changes will be most significant in the maritime Antarctic, where warmer temperatures and increased precipitation will accelerate weathering and soil development.
