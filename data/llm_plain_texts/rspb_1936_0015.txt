tldr: The author conducted experiments with condenser discharges and constant current pulses on sciatic nerves of Hungarian Rana esculenta to study the strength-duration relation for electric excitation of medullated nerve. They found that the agreement between the calculated curve and experimental points was usually very good, with an average divergence of only 2%. This research provided a better understanding of the relationship between the strength and duration of electrical stimulation needed to excite nerves.
