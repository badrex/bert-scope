tldr: 'The author, John R. Young, investigates the curvature of surfaces and the lines of curvature using a different method than previously employed. He derives equations for the normal to the surface and the lines of curvature, and discusses the properties of radii of curvature. The author also explains the relationship between umbilical points and the osculating sphere, and how the number of lines of curvature passing through an umbilical point can be infinite.'
