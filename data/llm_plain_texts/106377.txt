tldr: The author presents a new method for treating fistula lachrymalis, a condition where tears and mucus cannot pass through the nasal duct. The treatment involves injecting quicksilver into the duct to remove the obstruction and allow fluids to flow properly. This method is most effective in the early stages of the disease and causes minimal pain and risk.
