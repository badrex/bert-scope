tldr: The article describes the largest known Cambrian animal, Anomalocaris, found in the Burgess Shale of British Columbia. This mysterious creature reached up to 0.5 meters in length and had unique features like a pair of large jointed appendages and a unique jaw circlet. Although not considered an arthropod, Anomalocaris was a formidable predator, preying on soft-bodied organisms and possibly inflicting wounds on trilobites. The discovery of this ancient animal highlights the importance of studying soft-bodied fossils for understanding the history of life on Earth.
