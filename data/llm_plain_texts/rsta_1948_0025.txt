tldr: The authors present a complete system for five ternary quadratic forms and demonstrate its irreducibility. They use symbolic algebra to analyze the concomitants of these forms and establish a classification of irreducible concomitants for any number of ternary quadratics. This work contributes to the understanding of ternary quadratic types and their applications in various mathematical fields.
