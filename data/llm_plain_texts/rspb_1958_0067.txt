tldr: The authors studied the distribution of haemoglobin and blood potassium types in 33 British sheep breeds. They found that hill breeds have a higher frequency of the haemoglobin A and high-potassium genes, while lowland breeds have a higher frequency of the haemoglobin B and low-potassium genes. The study provides insights into the genetic variation and population genetics of these characters in sheep.
