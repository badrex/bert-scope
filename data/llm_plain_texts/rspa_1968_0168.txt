tldr: 'The authors analyze the photolysis of hexafluoroacetone vapor and discuss the mechanism behind the primary process. They find that the weak collision mechanism applies in this system, with five independent tests supporting this hypothesis. The study contributes to understanding the chemical reactions and processes involved in the photolysis of hexafluoroacetone.'
