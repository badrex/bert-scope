tldr: The authors describe a model for the sub-structure of the nucleosome core particle in chromatin, which consists of two identical halves with histone tetramers. They propose that this structure can linearize to accommodate the action of transcription and replication enzymes. The model suggests that histones remain attached to DNA during these processes, allowing for precise refolding and organization of new and old nucleosomes.
