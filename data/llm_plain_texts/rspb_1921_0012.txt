tldr: The authors studied the effect of oxygen on the fermentation process of B. coli communis, both in anaerobic and aerobic conditions. They found that the type of fermentation differs based on the organism's past history of aerobic or anaerobic growth. Anaerobic growth results in a lower yield of lactic acid and the absence of succinic acid. The authors suggest that oxygen may stimulate cell multiplication, leading to increased lactic acid production.
