tldr: 'A study on the moth Phigalia pilosaria in rural North Wales found that non-melanic moths had a survival advantage over melanic ones. The research suggests that factors other than predation, such as frequency-dependent and non-visual selection, may be responsible for maintaining the polymorphism in the moth population.'
