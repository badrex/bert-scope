tldr: The authors present a dynamical model of a crystal structure using bubbles floating on a soap solution to represent atoms. This model simulates the behavior of metal structures, showing structures like grain boundaries, dislocations, and other types of faults. The model helps to understand the plastic deformation of crystals and the role of dislocations in metal structures.
