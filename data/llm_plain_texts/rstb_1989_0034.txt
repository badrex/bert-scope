tldr: The article explores the interactions between peptides and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in immune recognition. It discusses the structural requirements for peptide-MHC binding and the permissive nature of these interactions. The study also examines the relative contributions of determinant selection and the T-cell repertoire in defining immune responses to protein antigens.
