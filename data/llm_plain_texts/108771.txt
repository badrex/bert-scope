tldr: The author investigates the products of caoutchouc distillation and discovers a new hydrocarbon called isoprene. Isoprene has unique properties, such as extreme volatility and the ability to decolorize substances like bromine and ozone. The author also describes the process of ozonization and the formation of a new substance called "ozonized isoprene" through distillation.
