tldr: 'The author, Sir John Lubbock, describes the zoological collections made during the Transit of Venus Expeditions in 1874-75. He focuses on the Collembola, a group of small invertebrates, collected from Kerguelen Island. Lubbock discusses three forms found, including a new genus he dedicated to M. Tullberg. He highlights the unique features of the IApiuridce, such as the absence of the saltatory organ and the mandibulate mouth.'
