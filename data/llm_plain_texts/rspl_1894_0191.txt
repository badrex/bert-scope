tldr: The author conducted experiments to compare Poisson's ratio obtained through direct measurement and tension-torsion experiments. The results showed that the two values were not the same, and the author concluded that the experiments were reliable for future research in elasticity. The author also thanked Professor Kennedy for his assistance in the experiments.
