tldr: The authors studied the color-changing abilities of the prawn species Hippolyte varians. They discovered that the color changes are due to the movement and distribution of pigments within specialized cells called chromatophores. The prawns use these color changes for camouflage and mimicry, adapting to their surroundings and the algae they live on. The authors also found that the color changes are influenced by light conditions and are periodic, with the prawns changing color at night and returning to their daytime color in the morning.
