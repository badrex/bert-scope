tldr: The author discusses the electronic properties and recent applications of amorphous silicon (a-Si), a new generation of electronically viable thin-film materials. The preparation of a-Si by the decomposition of silane in a radio-frequency glow discharge is crucial, as it leads to a material with a low density of gap states. Effective doping from the gas phase allows control of the electronic properties, leading to various applications such as photovoltaic devices, field effect transistors in liquid crystal displays, and image sensing arrays.
