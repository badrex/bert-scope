tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments on a gibbon to study motor localisation in the brain. They discovered a remarkable expansion of the cortex in the precentral region, which correlates with the gibbon's unique use of its arms and hands. The study also confirmed the deduction that the sulcus arcuatus would be pushed down to join the sulcus rectus. The research provides insights into the gibbon's motor skills and brain structure.'
