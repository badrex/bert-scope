tldr: 'The authors conducted density measurements on molten mixtures of potassium nitrate and barium nitrate to study their volume changes and mixing behavior. They found that the excess volume of mixing for these melts is zero, and the partial equivalent volumes of both components are independent of composition at a given temperature. This unusual mixing behavior is discussed in relation to possible structures for nitrate melts and other ionic liquids.'
