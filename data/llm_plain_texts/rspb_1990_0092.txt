tldr: This study found that human umbilical vein endothelial cells release ATP, substance P, and acetylcholine when exposed to increased flow rate. These neurotransmitters play a role in regulating blood flow and vascular tone. The findings have important implications for understanding the mechanisms of local blood flow regulation and the role of endothelial cells in the process.
