tldr: This article investigates the interaction of water with clay surfaces, focusing on the distribution of water molecules in clay gels and suspensions. The authors study the effects of salt concentration, pressure, and temperature on the water-clay system using techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance. They find that the surface force fields in clay gels affect the rotational motion of water molecules and create a surface phase with distinct properties compared to the bulk phase.
