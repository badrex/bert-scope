tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the fermentation of glucose by yeast juice and discovered the presence of a dialysable coferment substance. This coferment is essential for the fermentation process and can be activated by adding boiled yeast juice. The authors also found that the coferment disappears from yeast juice less rapidly in the presence of glucose than in its absence.
