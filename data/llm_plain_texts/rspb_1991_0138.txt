tldr: Researchers discovered a secreted enzyme from Candida albicans that branches (3-glucan, a key component of the yeast's cell wall. This enzyme is responsible for transforming the initial linear (1-3)-glucan into the branched (1-3)-(1-6)-glucan found in the cell wall of C. albicans. This finding sheds light on the mechanisms of cell wall formation and modification in yeasts and fungi.
