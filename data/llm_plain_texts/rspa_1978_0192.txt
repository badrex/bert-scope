tldr: The authors compared the Rb I 4p subshell excitation spectrum, observed in both photoabsorption and electron impact experiments, with Hartree-Fock calculations. They proposed detailed assignments for over half of the 40 lowest energy resonances between 15-19 eV, providing a good general interpretation of the spectrum. This study revised previous assignments and showed that interactions beyond Connerade's type 1 excitation model were necessary to describe the energy distribution of low-lying resonances correctly.
