tldr: The author conducted experiments in a heated room to study the effects of high heat on the human body. They discovered that humans can withstand much higher temperatures than previously thought, but excessive heat can cause discomfort and breathing difficulties. The body's ability to perspire and regulate temperature plays a crucial role in maintaining comfort in high heat.
