tldr: The study examines the development of ganglion cell morphology in the rat retina from 3 to 30 days postnatal. The research finds that the retina grows rapidly from birth to ten days and then more slowly until 30 days. Different ganglion cell types can be recognized by 10 days, but type I ganglion cells with adult size are not seen until 30 days. The growth of the retina and the decrease in cell density in the ganglion cell layer occur with the same time course as the increase in cell soma size and dendritic fields. The study provides insights into the normal developmental sequence of the rat retina, which is essential for understanding experimentally induced changes.
