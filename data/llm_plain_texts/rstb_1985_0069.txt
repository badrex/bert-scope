tldr: This article reviews the palaeomagnetic data available for making global palaeocontinental reconstructions for the late Silurian and early Devonian periods. The authors use palaeomagnetic data to orient continental fragments in a global map-frame and discuss the evolution and environment in the late Silurian and early Devonian. They present two internally consistent alternatives for the Silurian-Devonian boundary reconstruction and emphasize the importance of better data from Gondwanaland and evaluating the hypothesis of large-scale remagnetization of red beds.
