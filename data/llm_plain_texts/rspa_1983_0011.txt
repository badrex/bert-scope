tldr: This article explores the application of twistor diagrams to massless M\#xF8;ller scattering in quantum electrodynamics. The author extends the theory of twistor diagrams to a more general type of interaction between massless fields and demonstrates that earlier studies of this example have failed to render a correct account, but that the scattering data can be represented within the twistor formalism.
