tldr: The author investigates the feeding mechanisms of the Branchiopoda, focusing on Chirocephalus diaphanus, a general description of which has already been published. They study the limb movement and the arrangement of the parts of the limbs to understand the currents that lead to the collection of food and its transference to the mouth. The feeding process is divided into three main parts: the production of swimming-feeding currents, the abstraction of food particles from these currents, and the transference of the collected food to the mouth. The author concludes that the median space is continually emptied, and water is drawn from the surrounding region to replace it, playing a crucial role in the feeding process.
