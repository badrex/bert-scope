tldr: The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory operates four laser satellite-ranging systems to support geodetic and geophysical research. These systems are being upgraded to improve range accuracy and performance, including the addition of pulse-processing electronics and pulse choppers. The upgrades aim to achieve decimetre ranging-accuracy for satellites like Geos 3, Seasat, and Starlette, enhancing research in solid-Earth physics, oceanography, and dynamic geophysical phenomena.
