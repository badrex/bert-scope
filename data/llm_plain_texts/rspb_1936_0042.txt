tldr: The authors compared four methods for measuring the time-constant of nerve accommodation, including exponential, alternating current, "break" excitation at the anode, and "make" excitation at the cathode. They found that the exponential method provided consistent and easily obtained results, while the alternating current method was simple and repeatable. The study aimed to understand the speed of accommodation in excitable tissues and improve the accuracy of measuring the time-constant of nerve.
