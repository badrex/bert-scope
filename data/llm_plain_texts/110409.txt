tldr: Peter Barlow's paper explains the principles of constructing and applying negative achromatic lenses to various types of telescopes and eyepieces. He demonstrates that these lenses offer advantages beyond micrometer eyepieces, and can be used in a wide range of instruments, including refractors.
