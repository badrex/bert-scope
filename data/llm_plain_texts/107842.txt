tldr: In the early 19th century, Henry Kater and his team worked with French scientists to retrace the connection between the Royal Observatories of Paris and Greenwich. They used trigonometry and surveying techniques to measure the difference in longitude between the two locations, improving the accuracy of maps and navigation. This project helped advance the understanding of Earth's shape and the importance of precise measurements in science.
