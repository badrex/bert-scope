tldr: This article presents a theoretical and experimental study on the dielectric breakdown of gases at low pressure. The authors propose an alternative model of breakdown for this region, which is different from the Townsend theory. They develop a Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the primary ionization coefficient and extend the theoretical work to include secondary effects. The study also describes the design and construction of a larger apparatus to investigate the breakdown at higher voltages.
