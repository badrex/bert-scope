tldr: This study examines and redescribes the acanthopterygian and ctenothrissiform fish species from the English Chalk, providing detailed descriptions of all genera known by more than one specimen. The research also discusses the evolution, classification, and morphology of these fish species, as well as their possible relationships with other teleosts. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the Mesozoic era's acanthopterygian fish fauna.
