tldr: 'In a letter to Thomas Birch, Abraham Trembley reports his temperature observations in the Hague using a thermometer. He compares the temperature in 1757 to that of 1740, noting a difference of only five degrees on Fahrenheit's scale. The thermometer was placed in the same location as in 1740, a window exposed to the north.'
