tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the cohesion of lead balls. They found that the cohesion between the balls was different every time they were pressed together. The author also discovered that the force required to separate the balls varied depending on the surface area of contact. The experiments were performed before the Royal Society, and the author intended to continue the research to determine the exact measure of the touching surfaces and the maximum force of cohesion.
