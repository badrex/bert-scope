tldr: The authors created a P element derivative carrying the rosy gene to study the functions of P transposable elements in Drosophila. They found that the marked P element could transpose autonomously and examined the pattern of poly(A)+ transcripts encoded by P elements. The study aimed to dissect the functions encoded by P elements and understand their roles in gene expression and regulation.
