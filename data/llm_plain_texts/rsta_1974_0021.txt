tldr: This article discusses the significance of ancient astronomy in the context of archaeological landscapes, focusing on the Dorset cursus, a prehistoric monument in England. The authors explore the possible astronomical alignments associated with the cursus and suggest that it may have been used for both lunar and solar observations. They also examine the connection between the cursus and nearby burial mounds, proposing that the monument played a role in funereal cults and the commemoration of the dead.
