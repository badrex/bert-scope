tldr: 'The authors analyze the effect of nuclear magnetic moments on the scattering of fast electrons. They conclude that nuclear magnetic forces have a negligible effect on electron scattering, except in the case of scattering due to electrons themselves, which may be important in the scattering of fast particles by matter.'
