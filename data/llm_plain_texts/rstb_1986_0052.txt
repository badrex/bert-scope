tldr: The article discusses the potential for genetic manipulation of Rubisco, an essential enzyme for photosynthesis. It explores the use of site-directed mutagenesis and hybrid enzymes to create useful genetic variations. The authors also examine the possibilities of transferring genes between species and the importance of understanding natural variations in Rubisco's properties.
