tldr: The authors developed synthetic macrocyclic receptors for peptides that exhibit high enantioselective binding. They synthesized and studied macrocyclic receptors, such as macrotricyclic host 1, which showed enantioselective binding of 90-99% for simple peptides. The receptors' binding properties were evaluated through titrations and nmr monitoring, revealing three classes of simple peptides with enantioselectivity exceeding 1 kcal/mol. The authors also discussed the binding motifs and structures of the complexes, suggesting that complexation is driven by the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds.
