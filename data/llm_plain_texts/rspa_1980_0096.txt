tldr: The authors derive and solve moment equations for the growth and decay of small objects, such as particles, bubbles, or droplets, governed by discrete rate equations. They examine the accuracy of static solutions of various Fokker-Planck equations in an equilibrium model and compare them with numerical and exact analytical results. The moment equations provide a useful method for calculating moments and predicting time-dependence in these systems.
