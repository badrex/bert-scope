tldr: The author conducted extensive chemical research on blood and other animal fluids, focusing on the composition of serum and lymph. They discovered that serum contains albumen combined with a large proportion of alkali, which can be separated using electrical decomposition. The study also found that gelatine does not exist in the serum, and the serosity is a compound of albumen with excess alkali.
