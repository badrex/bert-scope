  - Tectonic sinks
  - Environmental pollution
tldr: The authors propose a solution to the increasing problem of waste disposal by incorporating waste material into down-warped sections of the Earth's surface, specifically in sedimentary and tectonic sinks. They discuss the feasibility of this method and its potential benefits, such as permanently disposing of waste and preventing further contamination of the world ocean.
