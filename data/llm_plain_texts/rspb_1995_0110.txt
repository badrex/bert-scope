tldr: The authors studied the sperm structure of the Neomeniomorpha, a group of primitive mollusks, and found similarities with the sperm of some 'primitive' annelids and other invertebrates. This suggests an ancient link between these groups and internal fertilization. The findings support the idea that early Bilateria used internal fertilization with direct sperm transfer, challenging the widely accepted theory that they were free-spawning, triploblastic organisms.
