tldr: The author discusses the effects of catecholamines on vertebrate smooth muscle physiology, specifically in guinea-pig taenia coli. They found that both alpha and beta-adrenergic agents block the spontaneous electrical activity of the cell membrane, but the sequence of events leading to the cessation of spike discharge is different. Alpha-adrenergic action primarily changes membrane conductance, while beta-adrenergic action stabilizes the membrane potential. These actions may be due to the release of calcium from intracellular stores and the stimulation of calcium extrusion, which affect membrane polarization and the degree of spontaneous activity.
