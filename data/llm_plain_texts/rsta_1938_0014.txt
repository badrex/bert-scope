tldr: The authors conducted a study on the rotational analysis of the first negative band spectrum of oxygen. They discovered that the bands are due to a transition between two states and provided a detailed analysis of the bands, including their wave lengths, intensities, and the corresponding energy levels. This study helped to understand the structure and behavior of oxygen molecules in the negative glow when a discharge is passed through oxygen at low pressure.
