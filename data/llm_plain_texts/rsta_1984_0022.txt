tldr: The authors review and assess theories used to predict the rate of growth of cracks due to creep. They propose continuum damage mechanics as a mechanism for crack growth in creep, presenting theoretical and experimental studies on cracked members in various materials. The theoretical predictions are shown to be in close agreement with experimental observations, demonstrating the effectiveness of continuum damage mechanics in modeling crack propagation through damaged material.
