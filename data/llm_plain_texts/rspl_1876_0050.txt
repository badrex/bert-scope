tldr: The author conducted experiments on the effects of heat on various chloro-brom-iodides of silver, forming different alloys. They observed the physical properties and changes in the alloys, such as specific gravity, color, and brittleness. The author also measured the coefficients of expansion and contraction of these alloys and discussed the anomalous behavior of some of them.
