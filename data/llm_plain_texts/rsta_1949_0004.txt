tldr: The inactivation of carboxypeptidase enzyme by X- and alpha-radiation was studied. The results showed that X-radiation inactivated more enzyme molecules than alpha-radiation. The study concluded that the enzyme molecules are inactivated by collision with a labile product resulting from the ionization of water. The X-ray ionic yield was approximately constant, while the alpha-ray ionic yield was only about one-twentieth of the X-ray yield.
