tldr: This article discusses the dynamics of entangled polymers and the role of topology in their behavior. The author argues that the forces between polymers have both static and dynamic effects, and that hard forces dominate in entanglement dynamics. The concept of a primitive path, the topological skeleton of a polymer, emerges as a locus of maximum diffusivity. The author also explores the diffusion equation and its application to polymer problems, and explains why a direct study of diffusion problems can obviate the need for a solution to the problem of the topological classification of curves.
