tldr: The author compared the spectra of a comet and a nebula, finding a striking similarity between them. Both displayed carbon spectra, suggesting that they are more condensed than nebulae with different spectra. This observation raises questions about the physical structure and temperature of comets and nebulas, emphasizing the need for further research in this area.
