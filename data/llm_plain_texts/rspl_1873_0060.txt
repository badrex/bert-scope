tldr: The author, John Tyndall, conducted experiments with fireman's respirators to mitigate the effects of smoke inhalation. He discovered that moistened cotton-wool and charcoal filters significantly improved the respirators' effectiveness. Tyndall's experiments led to the development of more advanced respiratory protection devices for firefighters, which have since become essential in saving lives during fires.
