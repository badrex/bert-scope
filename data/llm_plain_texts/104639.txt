tldr: The author investigates the original state and properties of spar and sparry products, particularly the crystals found in Cornish mines known as Cornish Diamonds. They discuss the fluidity of spar, the formation of crystals, and the role of water in geological formations. The author also proposes a hypothesis that spar is the universal "gluten" of stones and that stones continue to form in the Earth through similar processes.
