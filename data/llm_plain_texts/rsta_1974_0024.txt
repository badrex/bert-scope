tldr: The authors develop a molecular orbital description of ligand field spectra and test it by carrying out least-squares fits of the spectra of tetrahedral ions. They calculate general expressions for electron repulsion matrix elements and molecular spin-orbit coupling matrix elements within a molecular orbital basis. The model is tested against experimental data, providing a better understanding of ligand field excited states in transition metal complexes.
