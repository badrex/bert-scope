tldr: This article explores the process of silicification in diatom wall morphogenesis, focusing on the formation of the silica deposition vesicle, the different forms of silica, and the role of microtubules in wall formation. The authors provide evidence that fusing vesicles contribute to the membrane formation of the silica deposition vesicle and discuss the implications for understanding silicon metabolism and mineralization in vivo.
