tldr: The authors conducted an experiment to study the photoelectric effect of soft X-rays using twelve different elements. They measured the photoelectric currents generated by the X-rays and found that the photoelectric efficiency varied among the elements. The results showed no simple relationship between photoelectric efficiency and atomic number, indicating that the nature of the photoelectric plate has a connection with the relative soft-ray emissivity of different elements.
