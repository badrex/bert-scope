tldr: The authors studied the fine structure of hydrogen spectrum transitions using a combination of a Fabry-Perot interferometer and a spectrograph. They observed and analyzed the fine structure of various lines in the spectrum, providing valuable data for understanding the behavior of hydrogen atoms and their transitions.
