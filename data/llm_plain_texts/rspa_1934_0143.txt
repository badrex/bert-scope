tldr: This article presents an X-ray analysis of the structure of chrysene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. The authors use X-ray diffraction to determine the crystal data and molecular structure of chrysene, finding that it has a planar molecule with a center of symmetry. The study provides insights into the arrangement of atoms and the overall structure of the chrysene molecule.
