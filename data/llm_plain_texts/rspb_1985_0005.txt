tldr: The study investigates the role of the premotor cortex in motor preparation using rhesus monkeys. The researchers found that 70 cells showed the predicted activity patterns, supporting the view that the premotor cortex plays a role in motor preparation. The study focuses on set-related neurons and their activity during periods of motor preparation, providing insights into the neural mechanisms underlying motor control and planning.
