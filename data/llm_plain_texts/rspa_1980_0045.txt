tldr: This article investigates the influence of high pressures on the spontaneous and Ag+-induced aquation reactions of Co(NH3)5Br in the presence of polyelectrolytes. The results show that the polyelectrolyte-accelerated reactions are retarded at elevated pressures. The study highlights the role of solvation and desolvation in polymer 'catalysis' and provides insights into the dehydration effects on the activated complex.
