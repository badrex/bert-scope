revised_title: 'Wolbachia Superinfections and the Expression of Cytoplasmic Incompatibility'

tldr: Researchers discovered that when Drosophila simulans flies carry two different strains of the Wolbachia bacteria, they exhibit unidirectional incompatibility with both single-strain infected flies. This phenomenon, called superinfection, can spread through populations and has implications for controlling insect-borne diseases by replacing existing strains with desirable ones.
