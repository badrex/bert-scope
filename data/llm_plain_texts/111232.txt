tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the role of atmospheric nitrogen and ammonia in plant nutrition. They found that while plants absorb nitrogen from the air, the ammonia in the atmosphere does not significantly contribute to plant growth. However, adding ammonia to the air can stimulate and modify plant growth, but it must be used carefully as it can also cause accidents. The author also discovered that the timing of ammonia exposure can affect plant flowering and fertility.
