tldr: This article discusses the biosynthesis and reactivity patterns of various tetrapyrrole pigments, including porphyrins, chlorophyll, and vitamin B. The authors use molecular orbital calculations to predict and explain the reactivity of different carbon atoms within these pigments. They also explore how metal-ligand interactions can dramatically change the properties of the pigments, such as their redox potentials and reactivity.
