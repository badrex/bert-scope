tldr: The authors present a theoretical study of impurity and defect induced instabilities in GaAs, focusing on the EL2 defect center and substitutional donors. They use a combination of empirical tight-binding and ab initio pseudopotential methods to analyze the structural and electronic properties of these defects. The study provides insights into the metastable states of the As-antisite and the properties of DX centers in GaAs, which can help improve the understanding and manipulation of the material's electronic and optical properties.
