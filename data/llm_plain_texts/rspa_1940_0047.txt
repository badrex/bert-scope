tldr: The authors compared the acceleration due to gravity at the National Laboratory in Teddington and the Bureau of Standards in Washington, D.C. They used a two-pendulum apparatus and six half-seconds invar pendulums to make accurate measurements. The results showed a difference of 0.0046 cm/sec², confirming the accuracy of both absolute determinations.
