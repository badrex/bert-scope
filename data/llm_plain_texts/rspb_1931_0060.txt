tldr: The study investigates the breakdown and resynthesis of phosphagen in frozen and thawed muscles. It shows that freezing causes phosphagen breakdown, and the rate of breakdown is highest at -2.6Â°C. The research also demonstrates that muscles can recover phosphagen content after thawing, but the recovery is more challenging with lower freezing temperatures. The study highlights the relationship between the circulatory system of carbohydrates in muscles and phosphagen, but it does not determine their individual functions or how they are interrelated.
