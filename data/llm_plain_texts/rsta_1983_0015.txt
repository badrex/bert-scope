tldr: This study examines the flow of molten polymers into, within, and out of ducts, focusing on the effects of flow rate, temperature, and molecular weight on the behavior of the polymer. The researchers use flow birefringence techniques to observe the evolution and relaxation of molecular orientation as the polymer flows through the duct. They find that the'short-time-scale' relaxation behavior depends on the entrance velocity gradient, while the 'long-time-scale' relaxation behavior has a different dependence. The findings contribute to understanding how molten polymers respond to different velocity fields in processing devices.
