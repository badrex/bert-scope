tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the diffraction of cathode rays by thin films of copper, silver, and tin. They found that the diffraction patterns of these materials supported the de Broglie theory and provided evidence for the crystal lattice structures. The results showed that the films consist of a conglomeration of minute crystals with no definite orientation.
