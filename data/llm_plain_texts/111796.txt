tldr: The author, Peter William Barlow, conducted experiments on beams of cast iron to determine the position of the neutral axis and discovered an additional element of strength called "resistance to flexure." This element of strength is dependent on the depth of the metal in connection with the deflection and varies directly with the amount of deflection into the depth of the metal. This discovery challenges the existing theory of beams, which only recognizes two elements of resistance: tension and compression.
