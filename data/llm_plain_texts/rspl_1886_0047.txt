tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the production of ozone using electric discharge. They found that ozone is only produced when sparks pass through oxygen. The smallest detectable amount of ozone was 0.0384 milligrams, which is less than 0.00016 of the whole quantity of oxygen that had passed through the apparatus. The authors also discovered that ozone can be produced when an electric spark passes through carefully dried oxygen.
