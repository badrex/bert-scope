tldr: The authors describe the development of a new primary standard barometer with improved accuracy and precision for measuring atmospheric pressure. The barometer features a stainless steel construction, optically flat and parallel glass windows, and a mercury vapor condensation pump for maintaining a vacuum above the mercury. This new design allows for more accurate observations of mercury surfaces and reduces errors caused by optical distortion.
