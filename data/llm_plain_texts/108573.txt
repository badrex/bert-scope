tldr: The author, Edward Sabine, conducted a study to investigate the influence of the moon on the magnetic declination at Toronto, St. Helena, and Hobarton. The results showed that there is a systematic variation in the magnetic declination depending on the moon's hour-angle, with a total amount of variation of 27.9 arcseconds. The study also found that the variation passes through zero four times in 24 lunar hours, with times around the moon's upper and lower culminations.
