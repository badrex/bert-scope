tldr: The article studies the long-wavelength asymptotics of unstable crossflow modes in boundary layers, including the effect of surface curvature. It explains the progression of crossflow-vortex structures from inflectional upper branch modes to nearly neutral long-wavelength modes aligned with the wall-shear direction. The analysis considers the stabilizing effects of convex surface curvature on the crossflow instability and discusses the role of viscosity in modifying growth-rate behavior.
