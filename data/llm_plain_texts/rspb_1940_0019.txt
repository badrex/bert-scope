tldr: The study investigates the effect of unilateral castration on spermatogenesis in rabbits. The results show that unilateral castration does not result in hypertrophy of function in the remaining testis; the rate of spermatozoa production remains at approximately half that of the control group. This research contrasts with previous findings in rats, highlighting differences in technique and potential species differences.
