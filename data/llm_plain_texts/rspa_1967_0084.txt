tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the kinetics of the reaction between hydrogen atoms and nitric oxide. They found that the reaction is a third-order process and that the overall rate constants depend on the third body used. The study provides insights into the efficiency of different third bodies in the reaction and the role of third bodies in the formation of ground state and electronically excited HNO.
