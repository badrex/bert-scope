semantic_tags:

  - Ferromagnetism
tldr: The authors investigate the electrical conductivity and magnetic properties of transition metals like nickel, palladium, and platinum. They explain the high resistance of these metals due to the small overlap of energy zones and the large effective mass of conduction electrons. The study also connects the magnetic properties of these metals to their electrical conductivity.
