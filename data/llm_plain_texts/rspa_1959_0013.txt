tldr: This study investigates the infra-red spectra of thirty-seven proteins, focusing on the differences in spectra between various proteins and the impact of molecular configuration on their infra-red spectra. The research reveals that while the spectra of all proteins are similar, differences in the intensities and positions of bands can be used to distinguish between different types of proteins and identify their molecular structures.
