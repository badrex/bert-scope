tldr: 'The author studied the formation of condensation nuclei in gases by various agents, such as X-rays, uranium rays, and ultra-violet light. They found that these agents create charged particles called "ions" and uncharged nuclei, which require different degrees of supersaturation for water to condense on them. The experiments showed that the charged particles play a role in the passage of electricity through gases.'
