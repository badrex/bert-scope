tldr: This article explores the use of fluorescent substances in conjunction with photoelectric cells to create a non-selective, highly sensitive quantum counter for measuring radiations of different wavelengths in the ultra-violet region. The author investigates various fluorescent substances and their properties, ultimately concluding that aesculin in water is the most suitable solution for this purpose. The potential for further advancements and applications in photometry is discussed.
