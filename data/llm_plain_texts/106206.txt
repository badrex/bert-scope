tldr: The author, Mr. Ludlam, conducted astronomical observations to determine the latitude of Leicester using a quadrant and recorded the zenith distances of various stars. The observations also examined the accuracy of a clock and compared it to mean time. The latitude of Leicester was determined to be 52Â°38', and the clock was found to be 14.6 seconds slow compared to mean time.
