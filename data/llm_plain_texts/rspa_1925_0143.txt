tldr: This study investigates the number of particles in the beta-ray spectra of Radium B and Radium C, focusing on the continuous spectrum. The researchers used a magnetic field to deflect and analyze the beta particles, enabling them to determine the rate of energy liberation and the number of particles in the lines of Radium. Their findings contribute to the understanding of the origin of the continuous spectrum and the nature of beta particles emitted during radioactive decay.
