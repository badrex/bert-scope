tldr: This study demonstrates multiple paternity in lekking cichlid fishes from Lake Malawi using microsatellite variation analysis. The research shows that multiple males contribute to the offspring of a single female, supporting the hypothesis of a mating system characterized by unrestricted female choice. The high expected average exclusion probability using both microsatellite loci suggests that microsatellite variation can be useful for quantifying mate choice in these species.
