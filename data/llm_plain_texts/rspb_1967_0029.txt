tldr: The study investigates the relationship between natural selection and feeding speed in blood-sucking insects, specifically mosquitoes. It shows that mosquitoes that can quickly feed and complete their meal before the host's irritation sets in have a higher chance of survival and egg production. The research compares a wild mosquito population with a colonized species, revealing that the wild mosquitoes have faster feeding speeds due to natural selection pressures.
