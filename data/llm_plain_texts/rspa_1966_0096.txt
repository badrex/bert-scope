tldr: The authors present a time-dependent coupled Hartree-Fock approximation to describe the effects of time-dependent perturbations on many-electron systems. They apply this method to calculate the frequency-dependent refractive index of helium gas, finding results that differ by between 4 and 8% from accurate values obtained by a refined variational calculation.
