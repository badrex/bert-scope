tldr: The author studied the development of Neomenia carinata Tullberg, a species of Mollusca Aplacophora. They found that the embryos develop through a unique process of gastrulation, with an unusual pseudoblastopore. The larvae do not have a typical metameric segmentation and do not feed. The author also observed the metamorphosis process, during which the larvae exchange a pelagic for a benthic life. The study provides valuable insights into the development of solenogastres and their relationship to other mollusks.
