tldr: The authors measured the absorption cross-sections of oxygen in the vacuum ultra-violet region, finding a maximum value of 1.81 x 10^-17 cm² at 1450 A. They also discussed technical methods of quantitative absorption spectrophotometry in this part of the vacuum ultra-violet. This research is important for understanding ionized layers in the upper atmosphere.
