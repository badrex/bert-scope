tldr: The authors investigate the conditions for thermal runaway in reactors with small nonuniformities, focusing on three classes of perturbations: a small temperature variation on the boundary, a small distortion of the boundary of a circular cylindrical domain, and a small hole in the domain. They derive asymptotic expansions for the critical Frank-Kamenetskii parameter and use numerical schemes to determine numerical values for the coefficients in the expansions. The results are compared with numerical solutions of the perturbed problem.
