tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the multiplication of microorganisms in water under different temperature and storage conditions. They found that microorganisms in both filtered and unfiltered river water can multiply rapidly at 20°C and even more so at incubator temperatures (35°C). However, over time, the number of microorganisms in unfiltered water tends to decrease. The author also observed that microorganisms in filtered river water multiply more quickly than those in unfiltered water.
