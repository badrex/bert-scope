tldr: The authors conducted experiments using radium D in an expansion chamber to study its nuclear beta-rays and the secondary electrons produced during its decay. They identified two types of tracks: isolated short tracks and long tracks, which often originated at the same point as very short companion tracks. The authors determined the points of origin of these tracks and analyzed the ranges of the nuclear tracks, providing insights into the nuclear decay process and the behavior of secondary electrons.
