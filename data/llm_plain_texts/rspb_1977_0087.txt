tldr: The authors discovered two Drosophila melanogaster mutants with abnormal synaptic transmission at the larval neuromuscular junction. The mutations affect the same gene on the X-chromosome and cause prolonged increases in calcium conductance at the nerve terminal. The researchers suggest that defective potassium channels in the nerve terminal membrane may be the cause of the abnormal neuromuscular transmission in these mutants.
