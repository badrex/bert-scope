tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the volatile substances given off during the putrefaction of animal matter, particularly focusing on hospital gangrene. They discovered that the noxious vapors contained nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus elements from the animal substance, and not in the simple forms of ammonia, and sulfuretted and phosphuretted hydrogen. The research also found that different volatile bodies are released during various stages of putrefaction.
