tldr: 'Jumping spiders' reactions to the Mediterranean fruit fly depend on the spider's size, age, and sex. Large, adult female spiders are less confused or intimidated by the fly, reducing the benefits of the fly's resemblance to a spider and casting doubt on whether the fly's characteristics evolved solely to confuse spiders.'
