tldr: The author investigates the non-luminous oxidation of phosphorus in an oxygen atmosphere and discovers that the rate of absorption is significantly different when phosphorus is glowing compared to when it is dark. The experiments show that the glow is not necessary for the absorption of oxygen, and the slow absorption occurs without producing any visible light.
