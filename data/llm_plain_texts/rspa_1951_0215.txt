tldr: This article discusses the second-order theory of conformal solutions in multicomponent systems. It presents a new method to calculate the thermodynamic properties of these systems using a reference substance and interaction constants. The authors explore the excess free enthalpy of mixing at constant temperature and pressure, and evaluate the second-order terms in the process. They provide an expression for the second-order free enthalpy of mixing and explain how the coefficients can be related to the thermodynamic properties of the reference species.
