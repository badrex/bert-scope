tldr: The article investigates the efficiency and evolution of water transport systems in higher plants through a modeling approach. It analyzes the effectiveness of protostele and siphonostele in water conduction by performing numerical simulations. The results demonstrate that the hydrodynamic behavior of a plant axis depends on the relative amount of conducting tissues and the arrangement of xylem within the axis. This study provides insights into the role of water transport in stelar evolution.
