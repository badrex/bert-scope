tldr: This study examines the genetic differences within a 495 base pair section of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene in two monophyletic groups of Indo-West Pacific butterflyfishes. The research reveals a striking concordance between species in both groups, with a 2.0% genetic break separating individuals between the Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean. The findings suggest that genetic differentiation was influenced by common environmental factors and that low levels of within- and between-species genetic differences imply a recent divergence time, possibly linked to Pleistocene climatic fluctuations.
