tldr: This article explores the motion of photons and particles around two extreme Reissner-Nordstrom black holes. The authors find that periodic orbits play a significant role in characterizing the chaos in this system. They also study the Newtonian limit and the first post-Newtonian approximation of the problem, comparing them with the fully relativistic case.
