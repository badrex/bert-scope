tldr: This article presents new tables of the motions of Jupiter's satellites, based on the author's observations and corrections. The tables provide the epochs of the conjunctions of the satellites with Jupiter, fitted to the Julian year and the meridian of the Royal Observatory at Greenwich. The author also discusses the eccentricity of the satellites' orbits, their nodes, and the synodical equations of the satellites' revolutions. These tables can be used by astronomers to construct more accurate predictions of the satellites' positions and movements.
