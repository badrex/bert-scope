tldr: In this study, John Herschel examines the spectra of several southern nebulae using a telescope and spectroscope. He observes distinct lines in the spectra, which he measures and compares to previous observations. He also studies the spectrum of lightning and notes the presence of bright lines, including the blue nitrogen line and a suspicion of the red hydrogen line.
