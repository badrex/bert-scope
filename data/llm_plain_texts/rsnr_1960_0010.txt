tldr: The article discusses the mathematical brilliance of Sir Christopher Wren, who made significant contributions to various scientific fields, including mathematics, astronomy, and optics. Wren's work in mathematics includes solving Kepler's problem and discovering that the hyperboloid of revolution is a ruled surface. His architectural achievements were influenced by his mathematical background, and he applied his knowledge to design and construct iconic buildings. However, his mathematical focus may have prevented him from reaching greater heights in the field.
