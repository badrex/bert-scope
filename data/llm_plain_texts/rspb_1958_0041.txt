tldr: This article investigates the relationship between solubility, molecular association, and structure in indigoid dyes, which are used in enzyme cytochemistry for staining reactions. The study finds that indigo and its 5:5'- and 6:6'-substituted derivatives have lower solubilities due to edge-to-edge hydrogen-bonded association, while 4:4'- and 7:7'-substituted dyes have higher solubilities. The findings can help improve the design of indigogenic methods for enzyme localization in cytochemical staining.
