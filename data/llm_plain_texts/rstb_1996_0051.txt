tldr: The article discusses the structure and function of the Escherichia coli met repressor, which regulates methionine synthesis, and compares it to the trp repressor that controls tryptophan synthesis. Both repressors have different three-dimensional structures and recognize their respective DNA operator sequences in different ways. The met repressor binds to tandem repeats of'met' boxes, while the trp repressor binds to 'trp' boxes. The repressors use a combination of direct contacts and indirect sensing of DNA conformation to distinguish between their operators.
