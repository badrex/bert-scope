tldr: The authors investigated the catalytic decomposition of sodium hypochlorite by cobalt peroxide. They found that the reaction rate increased with the addition of sodium salts, and the effect of sodium chloride was quantitatively examined. The results showed that the reaction was accelerated by the presence of sodium ions, and the degree of ionization of the mixed solution was calculated to understand the reaction mechanism.
