tldr: The author, Sir J. F. W. Herschel, investigates the unique dispersion of light in quinine solutions, which he calls "epipolic dispersion." He discovers that this dispersion occurs only at the surface of incidence and cannot be repeated through multiple layers of the solution. He also observes a blue film on the surface of the liquid, which he believes occurs in all directions. The author explores various other liquids to understand the phenomenon further but finds that only quinine solutions exhibit this unique dispersion.
