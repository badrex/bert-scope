tldr: The author discusses the composition and formation of the Earth's core, focusing on the presence of iron and a light element, likely oxygen, which significantly affects the core's density and melting point. The author also presents a two-component mixing model for the Earth's formation, explaining the abundance of iron oxide in the Earth's mantle and the origin of the Earth's magnetic field.
