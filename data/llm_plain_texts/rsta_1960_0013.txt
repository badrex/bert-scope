tldr: This article presents a kinematical theory of electron transmission microscope images of dislocations and other defects in crystals. The theory explains the diffraction contrast, which is sensitive to changes in orientation, thickness, and atomic displacements due to lattice strains. The method allows for the study of defect distribution and behavior, while also providing a better understanding of the contrast features observed in electron micrographs.
