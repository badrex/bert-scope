tldr: This article investigates the impact of interelectronic collisions on conduction and breakdown in covalent semi-conductors. The authors consider various temperature ranges and electric fields, finding that interelectronic collisions play a significant role in determining the electron distribution function, even at low electron densities. The study also reveals that the calculation by Yamashita and Watanabe only applies to a limited temperature range.
