tldr: The author presents preliminary results of pendulum experiments conducted in India, particularly in the vicinity of the Himalayas. The experiments show that the force of gravity is less than expected at these locations, supporting the theory that the Earth's strata below mountains are less dense than those below plains and the sea. This finding contributes to a better understanding of the Earth's ellipticity and the value of gravity.
