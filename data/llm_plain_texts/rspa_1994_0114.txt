tldr: This article proves the existence and uniqueness of geodesics and Jacobi fields in singular semi-Riemannian geometry. It focuses on non-isotropic geodesics, which are geodesics tangent to neutral vectors, and their applications in various contexts, such as black holes and metric singularities.
