tldr: The article discusses the role of SV40 Large T-antigen in cellular transformation. The Large T protein, encoded by SV40 virus, interacts with cellular DNA and influences cellular DNA synthesis and transcription. It also forms a complex with the host-coded p53 protein, which may play a crucial role in the oncogenic action of the protein. The study aims to understand the interaction between Large T and p53, as well as the cellular targets of Large T in transformed cells.
