tldr: The study investigates the myotomal musculature of the Southern smelt Retropinna retropinna from lacustrine and riverine populations to understand the differences in muscle morphology and growth dynamics related to their maximum body size and migratory habits. The research finds that riverine smelt have a significant increase in red muscle percentage during post-migratory stages, while lacustrine smelt have slower growth rates and smaller maximum sizes. The results demonstrate the usefulness of muscle plasticity in fish under natural conditions in relation to the environment and behavior.
