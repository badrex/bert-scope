tldr: This study investigates the absorption and emission spectrum of all-trans-1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) dissolved in a nematic liquid crystal mixture. The researchers discovered a new transition between perpendicular moments, attributed to a 1A-1G transition. They developed a theory for treating absorption data in ordered media and examined the effects of molecular orientation distribution. The technique presented offers better identification of electronic transitions compared to fluorescence methods.
