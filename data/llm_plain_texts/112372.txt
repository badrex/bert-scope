tldr: The author, William Crookes, discusses the challenges in measuring the luminous intensity of light and proposes a new method using a uniform glass lamp with alcohol and benzol fuel. He also describes a photometer that uses polarized light to compare the relative intensities of different light sources, allowing for more accurate measurements of light, even when the colors differ.
