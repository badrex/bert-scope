tldr: The author conducted experiments with potassium vapour to study its dispersion and absorption effects. They discovered that the deviation due to potassium vapour is observable over the whole visible spectrum and for a distance in the ultra-violet. The author found that strong absorption takes place at the lines of the principal series and for wave-lengths near these series lines, which they called "anomalous dispersion." This phenomenon has been observed at seven of the pairs forming the principal series lines for potassium.
