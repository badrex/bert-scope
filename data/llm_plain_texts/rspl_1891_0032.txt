tldr: The author presents a new type of air thermometer that can measure temperature with high accuracy. The compensated air thermometer eliminates the need for a mercury manometer and can read temperature to the thousandth part of a degree Celsius. This instrument is suitable for precise temperature measurements in various applications, including research on the behavior of gases at high temperatures.
