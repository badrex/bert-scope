tldr: The authors discuss the calculus of factorials and its applications in physiology, particularly in the study of bases derived from cinchonine and tar. They observe that the physiological activity of these bases is related to their chemical structure and that they do not possess specific paralytic action on the heart. The research focuses on the properties and relations of direct and inverse functions, as well as the development of a new branch of analysis based on the general theory of factorials.
