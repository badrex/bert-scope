tldr: This article discusses the role of structural materials and forms in combating wind loads and reducing their effects on buildings and structures. It highlights the importance of high static strength, strength under repeated loads, high stiffness, low density, and high damping in materials and structures to resist wind loading. The author suggests that there is greater scope for developing more suitable structural forms within the limits of existing materials rather than expecting a radical improvement of materials themselves.
