  - Uric acid
  - Butterfly wing pigments
tldr: The author explores the chemistry of pterins, pigments found in butterfly wings, and their derivatives. They discover a new derivative, rhodopterin, which has properties similar to pterins and is formed from pterins or certain related compounds. The study also reveals a connection between pterins and uric acid, a substance found in mammalian tissues and possibly with physiological functions.
