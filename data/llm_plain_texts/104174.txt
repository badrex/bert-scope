tldr: A man named John Ferguison from Scotland lived for 18 years on just water and nothing else. He got sick one day and started drinking a lot of water, and after he recovered, he couldn't eat any food. People thought he was supernatural, but it turns out that water alone can support human life and health. This shows that we might not need to eat as much meat as we think.
