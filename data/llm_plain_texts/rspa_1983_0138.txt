tldr: The authors study the solutions of the Einstein equations for uniformly accelerated particles without nodal singularities. They apply Ernst's procedure to the Bonnor and Swaminarayan solutions and construct a new solution representing two independent Curzon-Chazy particles falling freely in opposite directions in an external gravitational field. This solution provides a clear physical interpretation for generalized Bonnor and Swaminarayan solutions and Ernst's generalized -metric.
