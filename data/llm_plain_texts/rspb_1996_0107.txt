tldr: The authors analyze a mathematical model to explore the relationship between the evolution of virulence in pathogens and the longevity of their propagules. They find that the optimal level of virulence is independent of propagule longevity when the host-parasite system has reached equilibrium. However, for pathogens that have recently invaded a susceptible host population, greater propagule longevity may initially favor higher virulence.
