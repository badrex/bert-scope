tldr: The author, John F. W. Herschel, conducted experiments on the effects of the solar spectrum on plant colors and resins, specifically focusing on guaiacum. He discovered that exposure to the spectrum could change the colors of plant juices and resins, and that certain materials became more sensitive to light when treated with chlorine. This research contributed to the understanding of the interactions between light, heat, and chemical agents in plants.
