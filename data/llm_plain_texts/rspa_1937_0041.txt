tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the absolute intensities of strong beta-ray lines of Ra, Th, and Ac. They used a combination of photographic methods and ionization chamber measurements to compare the relative intensities of the beta-ray groups for equal numbers of disintegrating atoms. The results confirmed some values of Ellis and Aston for RaB lines and Gurney's value for the ratio of the H line of RaB to the F line of ThB. The study also suggested that Gurney's values for the lines G and F of RaB were in error.
