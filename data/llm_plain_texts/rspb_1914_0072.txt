tldr: This study investigates the changes in breathing and blood composition at various altitudes. The researchers observed that as altitude increases, the alveolar CO2 and O2 pressures decrease, with a corresponding increase in hemoglobin percentage. The findings suggest that the human body responds differently to altitude changes, with age and individual factors affecting the respiratory response.
