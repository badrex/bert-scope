tldr: 'This study investigates the physiology and biochemistry of zooxanthellae, symbiotic algae living with marine coelenterates. The research focuses on the extracellular products released by these algae, specifically the liberation of fixed 14C. The findings show that freshly isolated zooxanthellae from various marine coelenterates release soluble organic 14C into the medium when incubated in the light. Most of the extracellular products are [14C]glycerol, with other compounds such as alanine, glucose, fumaric acid, succinic acid, glycolic acid, and two unidentified organic acids. The study demonstrates that these products are not produced as a result of algae lysis, providing evidence for the role of zooxanthellae in the symbiotic relationship with their marine hosts.'
