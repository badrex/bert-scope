tldr: The author investigates the efficiency of secondary electron emission from various metal faces, including polycrystalline and single crystal surfaces, using a retarding potential method. The study reveals that the efficiency of full velocity electrons is smaller for single crystal faces, while the efficiency of scattered electrons is higher. The results provide insights into the behavior of secondary electrons and their applications in various fields.
