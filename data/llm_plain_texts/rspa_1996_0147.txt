tldr: The article analyzes the diffraction of reaction-diffusion waves by toroidal obstacles using the eikonal approximation to excitable reaction-diffusion equations. The authors demonstrate the existence of two stable and unstable stationary spherical wave segments and suggest that the trapping of a spherical wave front by a toroidal obstacle can be verified experimentally using a chemical medium like the Belouzov-Zhabotinsky reagent in the excitable regime.
