tldr: The study investigates the release of sialic acids and calcium from rat aortas using neuraminidase. The results suggest that sialic acids and calcium are associated in vivo, which may have implications for atherosclerosis development. This research provides evidence that the negative charges of endothelial sialic acids could be diminished through complex formation with calcium, potentially affecting the rate of LDL accumulation in artery walls.
