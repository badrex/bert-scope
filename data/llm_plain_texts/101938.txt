tldr: The author, Edm. Halley, investigates the cause of the change in the Earth's magnetic needle variation. He proposes a hypothesis that the Earth's internal parts move in a regular and gradual motion, affecting the magnetic needle's direction. This hypothesis explains the observed changes in the magnetic needle's variation worldwide and suggests that the magnetic poles are not fixed but moveable.
