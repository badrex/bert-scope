tldr: The author examines the value of different geological ages and formations, focusing on the deposition of formations such as the Old Red Sandstone, Permian, and New Red series. They argue that these formations were deposited in inland lakes and that a continental age prevailed over much of Europe during this time. The author also compares the time occupied in the deposition of these formations to the time occupied in the deposition of the Cambrian and Silurian rocks.
