tldr: This article presents a unified approach to solve self-similar mixed boundary-value problems in elastodynamics, including crack expansion and indentation problems. The author formulates the problems using the Radon transform and provides a method of solution. The study exposes the common features of both two-dimensional and three-dimensional problems and offers more general solutions for unmixed problems than previously available.
