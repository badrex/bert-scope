tldr: Samuel Roslington Milner was a prominent physicist and electrochemist who made significant contributions to the fields of thermal conductivity, surface chemistry, and electrolytic theory. He studied under Professor A. P. Chattock and later worked with Professor Nernst at the Physical Chemical Institute in GÃ¶ttingen. Milner's research focused on the measurement of thermal conductivity, the potential difference at the surface of mercury and electrolytes, and the development of new methods for measuring resistances and capacitances in electrolytic studies. He also promoted the importance of learning German and French for scientists and was a dedicated teacher who inspired many students throughout his career.
