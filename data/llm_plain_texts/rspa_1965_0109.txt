tldr: Researchers studied the thermal transformations of potassium nitrite and discovered that hybrid single crystals form with coexistence of two crystal forms in a specific temperature range. The transformation proves to be practically reversible, indicating a strong correlation between the absolute orientation of the two structures within the transformation interval. The findings provide insights into the crystal structure and potential ferroelectric behavior of potassium nitrite.
