tldr: The author, Michael Faraday, conducted experiments to study the relationship between gold and light. He discovered that gold particles can affect the properties of light, such as reflection, refraction, and absorption. Faraday's findings suggest that the size of gold particles can change the color of light, providing valuable insights into the undulatory theory of light and its interactions with matter.
