tldr: The authors develop a general theory of radio wave propagation by wave-guide modes, taking into account the earth's curvature, the gradualness of the ionosphere, and the earth's magnetic field. They use matrix admittance and reflexion coefficient variables to solve differential equations and evaluate the mode condition, excitation factor, and polarization of the waves in a mode. This theory allows for more accurate predictions of radio wave propagation at low frequencies.
