tldr: The authors explore the feasibility of using resonant drift under feedback-driven stimulation to control re-entrant activity in a model of mammalian atrial tissue. They simulate a two-dimensional sheet of atrial tissue and find that repetitive forcing can induce a drift of a spiral wave, potentially moving it to the inexcitable boundaries and eliminating re-entry. This approach could be a means of eliminating cardiac arrhythmias caused by re-entry.
