tldr: In this article, Stephen Gray describes his experiments on electricity and attraction. He explains how attraction can be communicated through various materials, such as glass, wood, and even rosin. Gray also discusses his experiments with two boys, one standing on rosin and the other suspended by hairlines, demonstrating the transfer of electrical attraction between them. He further explores the effects of attraction through different materials and distances, paving the way for future research in the field of electricity.
