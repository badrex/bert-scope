tldr: This article investigates the electric strength of mixtures of nitrogen and hydrogen at different pressures. The authors found that the electric strength increases as the proportion of hydrogen in the mixture increases, and that the critical pressure for the discharge diminishes as the proportion of hydrogen increases. The results provide insights into the behavior of gases under varying conditions and their potential applications in electrical systems.
