tldr: This study investigates the inheritance of sinistrality in the freshwater snail Limnaea peregra. Researchers found that the appearance of the offspring can be opposite to that of the parent, whether dextral or sinistral. The results suggest a complex system of inheritance, with dextrality acting as a simple Mendelian dominant trait. The study provides insights into the genetic and evolutionary aspects of this species.
