tldr: This article presents a new approach to understanding the propagation of high-frequency waves in inhomogeneous media, focusing on the effects of boundaries and the difference in curvatures of rays and boundaries. The author provides a unified formula for the field that can be applied to various media and boundaries, offering a simpler method of evaluation and extending the results to aperiodic phenomena in time.
