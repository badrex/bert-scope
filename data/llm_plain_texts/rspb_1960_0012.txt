tldr: The author investigates the absorption mechanism of glucose in the algae Scenedesmus quadricauda. They find that glucose uptake is dependent on adenosine triphosphate and occurs on the outside of the plasma membrane. The primary absorption mechanism is a hexokinase system linked with a system that regenerates adenosine triphosphate. The study also shows that light has a stimulating effect on glucose uptake, providing more energy-rich phosphates.
