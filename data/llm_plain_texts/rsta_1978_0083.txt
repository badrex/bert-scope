tldr: The authors solve Laplace's tidal equations for the M2 and S2 tides in the world oceans using a knowledge of the tidal potential alone. They account for tidal dissipation along coastlines and develop a fast iterative method to evaluate the secondary effects of tidal loading and self-attraction. The results show improved agreement between theoretical and observed tides, with the theoretical tidal phases generally within one hour of the observed values.
