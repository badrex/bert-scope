tldr: The authors describe the construction and use of a robust microbalance with high sensitivity, suitable for weighing sorbed films. The balance features carborundum crystal points for support and a magnetic control arrangement. The authors also discuss the challenges faced during the development and testing of the balance, such as zero point shifts caused by electrostatic charges.
