tldr: The author investigates the formation of ice and the grained structure of glaciers, discovering that ice is a liquid jelly with foam-walls containing concentrated salt solutions and foam-cells filled with pure or nearly pure water. The author explains how the properties of these foam-cells and walls contribute to the structure and behavior of glaciers, including the process of "regelation" and the growth of glacier grains.
