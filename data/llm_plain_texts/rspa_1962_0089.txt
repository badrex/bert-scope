tldr: This article discusses the correction of wave functions for krypton, focusing on the 3d and 4s wave functions. The authors compare their earlier results with the work of Watson and Freeman, which confirms their earlier results with the exception of the mentioned wave functions. The authors also mention a misprint in the total energy of bromine.
