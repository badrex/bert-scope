tldr: The article investigates the effects of cyanide on intracellular ionic exchange in ferret and rat ventricular myocardium. Cyanide ions were found to have a specific action on cardiac cellular ionic metabolism, primarily preventing mitochondrial sequestration. The study concludes that mitochondria could sequester at least 30% of the calcium accumulated by the cell, even when sarcoplasmic levels are low.
