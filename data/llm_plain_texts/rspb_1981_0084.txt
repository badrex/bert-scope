tldr: 'This article explores the existence of clines, non-uniform spatial distributions in genetic composition, in environments with variable selection and migration. The authors define clines as stable non-constant solutions of a mathematical equation and provide conditions for their existence in both bounded and unbounded habitats. They also discuss the effects of variable migration and carrying capacity on the formation of clines.'
