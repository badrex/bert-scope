tldr: This article discusses the mechanisms through which oceanic processes can cause rapid changes in atmospheric CO2 levels. Two main mechanisms are identified: exchange between the atmosphere and deep ocean through high-latitude regions, and the separation of regeneration of alkalinity and total carbon in the ocean. The authors also present a three-dimensional model to further study these processes and their impact on the global carbon cycle.
