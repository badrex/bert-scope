tldr: The author discusses the observed deviations of the compass in both wood-built and iron-built ships and presents a general table for examining compass deviations. The study focuses on the effects of induced magnetism and subpermanent magnetism on compass readings, providing a theoretical framework for understanding and correcting compass deviations in ships.
