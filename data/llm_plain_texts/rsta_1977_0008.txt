tldr: The authors conducted experiments using a pulse time-of-flight technique to measure the drag experienced by negative ions moving through liquid 4He. Their results support Landau's theory of superfluidity and demonstrate the inapplicability of other theories of supercritical dissipation. The findings are in excellent agreement with Bowley and Sheard's incoherent two-roton theory, allowing for the derivation of a numerical value for the matrix element characterizing two-roton emission.
