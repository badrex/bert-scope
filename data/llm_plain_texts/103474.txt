revised_title: 'A Critique of the New Opinion on the Forces of Moving Bodies in Non-Elastic Collisions'
semantic_tags:
  - Classical Mechanics
  - Collision Theory
  - Newtonian Physics
  - Kinetic Energy
  - Conservation Laws
tldr: The author examines the new opinion on the forces of moving bodies in non-elastic collisions and argues that equal causes cannot produce unequal effects. He provides examples of collisions between non-elastic bodies and shows that the new opinion does not hold true in all cases.
