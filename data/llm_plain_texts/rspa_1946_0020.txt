tldr: The authors studied the oxidation of liquid hydrocarbons, specifically tetralin, and found that the process follows an energy-chain mechanism. The oxidation rate is independent of oxygen pressure and proportional to the square of the hydrocarbon concentration. The reaction is a simple chain process without interaction of chain centers, and the energy-chain mechanism is responsible for the observed kinetics.
