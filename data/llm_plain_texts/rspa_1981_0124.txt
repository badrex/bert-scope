tldr: The study examines the stability and similarity of the laminar boundary layer in a streamwise corner. It presents new experimental results that show the corner boundary layer is unstable in laminar form at Reynolds numbers higher than about 102 * 4. The findings help explain the differences between various experimental and theoretical results in the field and provide a guide for current theories on the subject.
