tldr: The authors discuss the role of oceanic birds, particularly petrels, as potential agents for the trans-oceanic dispersal of plants and invertebrate animals. They argue that the abundance, density, and migratory patterns of these birds make them more likely to transport viable organic units than other birds. The authors also suggest that the downy feathers of these birds can carry seeds and other organic matter, providing a possible mechanism for long-distance transport.
