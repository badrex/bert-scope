tldr: This study compares the lethal effects and physiological actions of Enhydrina and Enhydris Curtus sea snake venoms. The authors found that Enhydrina venom is more lethal and has different actions on the respiratory and cardiovascular systems compared to Enhydris Curtus venom. The study also highlights the differences in the antagonism of Calmette's serum with the two venoms, suggesting a chemical difference in their composition.
