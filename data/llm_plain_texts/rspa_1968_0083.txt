tldr: The authors conducted experimental measurements of photoionization absorption continua for potassium, rubidium, and caesium, and reviewed existing data for lithium and sodium. They discussed the separation of atomic and molecular absorption and presented the data as absolute cross-section curves as a function of wavelength. The shapes of the atomic photoionization continua and their absolute values were analyzed in relation to existing theoretical cross-section data. The results provide insights into the photoionization processes in alkali metal vapours, which are significant in various plasma and astrophysical problems.
