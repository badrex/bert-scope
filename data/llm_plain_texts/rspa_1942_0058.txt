tldr: This article investigates the relationship between Debye theory and the lattice theory of specific heats in solid-state physics. The author compares the calculated values of specific heat from elastic constants and specific-heat data, finding that the ratio of these values is near unity for certain crystal types. The study also explores the behavior of this ratio for ionic crystals and provides a detailed analysis of the specific heat of lattices at high temperatures.
