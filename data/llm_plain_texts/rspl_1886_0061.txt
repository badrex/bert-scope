tldr: This article investigates the relationship between the thickness and surface tension of liquid films. The authors compare the surface tension of black films with that of colored films and analyze the sensitivity of various experimental methods. They find that while some methods are more sensitive than previous observations, the possibility of improvement is limited by the stability of the films. The authors also explore the effects of various factors on the surface tension and provide a detailed analysis of their experiments.
