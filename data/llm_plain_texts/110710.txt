tldr: The author, Martin Barry, studied the germinal vesicles in the ova of various species, including batrachian reptiles and osseous fishes. He found that the numerous spots in the germinal vesicle are the nuclei of cells. Barry confirmed and explained the observations of R. Wagner, stating that the number of spots in the ova increases as they ripen. He also observed a similarity between mammalian ova and the animal mentioned, with both having a substance surrounding the germinal vesicle made up of nucleated cells.
