tldr: This study investigates the relationship between oxygen intake, severity of exertion, and lactic acid accumulation during muscular exercise. The authors found that at low exercise intensities, oxygen supply is sufficient, and lactic acid does not accumulate. However, at high intensities, oxygen intake reaches a plateau, and lactic acid accumulates, leading to fatigue and exhaustion. The results suggest that the body's ability to provide energy during exercise is limited by the circulatory-respiratory system.
