tldr: The author studied the flame spectra in Swedish Bessemer iron works and observed different spectra from various locations. They discovered that the Bessemer process produces unique spectra with distinct characteristics, which can be used to analyze the composition of the iron works. The author also compared their findings with previous research on manganese oxide spectra and found similarities.
