tldr: This article presents experiments conducted on the explosions of coal-gas and air mixtures in a closed vessel. The authors studied the effects of varying the initial pressure and the composition of the gas mixture, and observed the changes in the time of explosion, maximum pressure, and cooling rates. The results showed that the heating value of coal-gas increases as the mixture gets weaker, and the rate of cooling increases with the initial pressure. The authors also discussed the hypotheses of dissociation and increasing specific heat to explain the differences between calculated and experimental results.
