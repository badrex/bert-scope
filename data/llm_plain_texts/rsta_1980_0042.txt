tldr: This article discusses improvements in Doppler satellite positioning for geodetic applications. The Defense Mapping Agency is working on enhancing the accuracy and precision of Doppler satellite geodetic positioning by using broadcast and precise ephemerides. They are also investigating changes in the precise ephemeris, such as using a more accurate value of GM and referencing the ephemeris to the satellite antenna electrical center. Additionally, they are exploring the use of short arc network techniques and working on improving the tropospheric refraction correction model. The article concludes that DMA is committed to improving Doppler positioning techniques and will share the results with the geodetic community.
