tldr: The author investigates the behavior of supersaturated saline solutions and their sensitivity to various surfaces and environmental factors. They found that supersaturated solutions can remain liquid for extended periods and that the presence of crystals is crucial for crystallization. The author also discusses the limitations of the crystal theory and the role of surface adhesion in crystal formation.
