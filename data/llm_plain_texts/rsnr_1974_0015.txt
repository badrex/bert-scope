tldr: In 1772, Joseph Banks, a prominent figure in the Royal Society, visited the Orkney Islands and participated in the excavation of prehistoric sites, including Skara Brae and Stennis. His contributions to the archaeological understanding of these sites were significant, but his work remained unpublished until this article brought attention to his plans and drawings. Banks was accompanied by notable scientists, such as Dr. Daniel Solander and Dr. James Lind, who also contributed to the exploration and understanding of the region.
