tldr: The WHO Onchocerciasis Control Programme in West Africa has made significant progress in controlling the transmission of onchocerciasis, or river blindness, by killing the fly's larvae in fast-flowing river sections. Despite challenges like reinvasion by migrating flies and insecticide resistance, the program has protected 20 million people, prevented seven million children from being at risk of blindness, and saved 100,000 people from blindness. The program continues to adapt its tactics and research new tools for vector control and disease prevention.
