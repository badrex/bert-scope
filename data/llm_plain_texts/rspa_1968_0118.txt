tldr: The authors studied the electronic band system of and radicals using absorption spectroscopy and rotational analysis. They found a significant change in the valence angle in the electronic transition and observed large doublet splittings in the excited state, which is the first example of an asymmetric top molecule showing substantial departures from Hund's case (b). This research extends previous observations of similar marked decreases in valence angles of hydrides of elements in the first and second rows of the periodic table to a hydride of an element in the third row.
