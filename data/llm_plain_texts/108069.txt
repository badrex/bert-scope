tldr: The author conducted observations on the structure and functions of tubular and cellular polyps, specifically focusing on Tubularia indivisa and Sertularia. They discovered internal currents within these organisms and described their growth, absorption, and reproduction processes. The author also discussed a unique Ascidia with a branching stem and a common circulation, which resembles Sertularice in some aspects. These observations provide insights into the physiology and organization of these organisms, contributing to the understanding of their functions and classification.
