tldr: The article investigates the diffraction effects of one-dimensionally disordered 2H crystals undergoing solid-state transformation to the 6H structure. The study compares the theoretical predictions with experimental observations on silicon carbide (SiC) and concludes that the transformation occurs through the layer displacement mechanism rather than the deformation mechanism. The presence of growth faults in the initial crystal is also considered, affecting the observable diffraction effects.
