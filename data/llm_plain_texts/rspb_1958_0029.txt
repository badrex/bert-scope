tldr: The authors studied cytoplasmic inheritance in Aspergillus nidulans, a fungus that reproduces both sexually and asexually. They discovered that a certain asexual colony type arises from a mutation in a single gene and is influenced by the cytoplasmic factor. This research helps to understand the complex genetic interactions in this fungus and may have implications for other organisms as well.
