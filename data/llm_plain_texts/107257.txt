tldr: The author examines the structure and function of intervertebral joints in fish and quadrupeds, focusing on the unique features of the spine in various species. They describe the mechanics of the joint, the role of elasticity, and the differences in structure between fish and quadrupeds. The author also discusses the implications of these findings for understanding human spine structure and treating spinal curvatures.
