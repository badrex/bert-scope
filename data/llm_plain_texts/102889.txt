tldr: This article explains Sir Isaac Newton's groundbreaking work on the theory of universal gravitation and its application to celestial mechanics. Newton demonstrates that the force of gravity is responsible for the motion of planets around the sun and the moon around the earth. He also explains the elliptical orbits of planets and the effects of gravity on comets, tides, and the motion of the seas. The article covers the mathematical foundations of Newton's work, as well as his critique of other theories and systems of the time.
