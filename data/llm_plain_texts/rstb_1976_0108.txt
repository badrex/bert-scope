revised_title: 'Flexuous Plant Virus Assembly and Properties of Their Proteins'
semantic_tags:
  - Virus assembly
  - Plant virology
  - Flexuous viruses
  - Protein structure
  - Reconstitution studies
tldr: The authors discuss the assembly of flexuous plant viruses, focusing on potato virus X and potato virus Y. They describe reconstitution experiments with these viruses and their proteins, examining the properties and structure of the reassembled particles. The study provides insights into the assembly process and the role of ionic strength in virus assembly.
