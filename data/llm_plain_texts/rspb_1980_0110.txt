tldr: This study investigates the functional significance of nectridean tabular horns in amphibians, specifically in the genera Diplocaulus and Diploceraspis. The authors conducted wind tunnel experiments on full-scale models of these creatures' skulls to analyze their lift, drag, and pitching moment coefficients. The results suggest that the unique physical properties of the head allowed these amphibians to be active midwater feeders, preying on small fish, larval amphibians, aquatic arthropods, and gastropods. The differences between the two genera are related to their contrasting environments, and the authors propose that dorso-ventral flattening in these species is an adaptation to an active aquatic lifestyle.
