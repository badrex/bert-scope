tldr: The authors describe a method to extract alcohol-soluble proteins from various types of bacteria. They found that these proteins are similar to those found in cereal seeds and are soluble in dilute alkali. The alcohol-soluble proteins were also found to be present in all the bacterial species examined, but their characteristics may vary. The authors also mention that injecting these proteins into rabbits did not cause any pathogenic effects, but anaphylactic phenomena were observed.
