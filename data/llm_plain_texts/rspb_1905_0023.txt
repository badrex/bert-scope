revised_title: 'The Structure and Function of Nerve Fibres: A Reevaluation of Macallum's Findings'

  - Electrolytes
  - Injury Current
tldr: The author investigates the structure and function of nerve fibers, focusing on the distribution of electrolytes and the injury current. They find that a solution of inorganic salts is present at every site of injury to a nerve fiber, refuting Macallum's conclusion that there are no electrolytes present in the axis-cylinder of the nerve-fiber.
