tldr: 'Henry Louis Le Chatelier was a prominent chemist and metallurgist who made significant contributions to the understanding of cement chemistry, the development of pyrometry, and the study of chemical equilibrium. His research on cement led to the identification of essential compounds in Portland cement and the understanding of the setting process. Le Chatelier also developed a new method for measuring high temperatures using thermo-electric couples and made important discoveries in the field of chemical equilibrium, now known as Le Chatelier's principle.'
