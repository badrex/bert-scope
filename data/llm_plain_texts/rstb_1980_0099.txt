tldr: This article discusses the progress made in the field of single cell protein (SCP) technology, focusing on the European feedstuff market, protein requirements for target species, and the role of SCP in animal feed. The author also explores the raw material options, technical challenges, fermentation processes, and optimization techniques involved in large-scale SCP production. Additionally, the nutritional performance of I.C.I.'s 'Pruteen' is evaluated, and the future prospects for SCP are considered.
