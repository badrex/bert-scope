tldr: This study uses Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd, and U-Th-Pb isotopic data to assess the contributions of mantle and crust sources to the formation of Precambrian granitoid rocks. The research finds that some granitoids have mantle or mixed mantle-crust isotopic characteristics, while others are produced solely by the anatexis of ancient continental crust. The findings highlight the importance of considering regional geological settings when studying granitoid petrogenesis.
