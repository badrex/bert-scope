tldr: The authors propose an independent approach to determine cluster sizes in pre-freezing liquids based on momentum transfer considerations and molecular dimensions. They calculate cluster sizes for n-heptane and n-decano and compare them with the average cluster size obtained using the mass-action equilibrium approach. The study also reports cluster volume fractions and average cluster sizes for halogenated benzenes, demonstrating the effect of decreasing molecular symmetry on cluster volume fraction. A quantitative criterion for the occurrence of viscosity anomalies is given in terms of the reduced melting temperature, which agrees with the model of restricted molecular rotation and holds in cases where other classifications fail.
