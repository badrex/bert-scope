tldr: The authors analyze the morphological stability of a two-dimensional nucleus growing on a substrate, focusing on two distinct cases: a conservative system and a non-conservative system. They find that the conservative system is less stable, while the non-conservative system is inherently more stable and shape-preserving. The study helps in understanding the growth and shape of nuclei in materials science.
