tldr: This article reviews the synthesis of macrocycle-containing liquid crystals, focusing on derivatives of synthetic aza crowns. The authors describe the synthesis of functionalized thioether crowns and their derivation to give oligobenzoate esters. They discuss the formation of mesogens and metallomesogens in these systems and use structural studies to probe ionophore and tail-group conformations. The article highlights the potential for macrocyclic liquid crystals to generate responsive mesophases that can switch as a function of cation host, redox change, stereochemistry, and/or photoactivation.
