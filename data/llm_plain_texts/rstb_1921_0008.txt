tldr: The author investigates the calcification patterns of vertebral centra in sharks and rays to determine their value in aiding the classification of Elasmobranch fishes. They examine the work of Hasse, who claimed that the differences in calcified laminae patterns could be used for taxonomy, but find that vertebrate morphologists do not consistently apply his definitions. The author studies 151 fishes from 44 genera and 68 species, analyzing their vertebral columns and comparing them to determine the usefulness of calcification patterns in fish classification.
