tldr: The author, Anthony Carlisle, examines the unusual distribution of arteries in the limbs of slow-moving animals, specifically the Lemur tardigradus and the Bradypus tridactylus. He observes that the arteries in these animals' limbs branch into numerous small cylinders, which he believes may help to slow down the blood flow to the muscles. This study contributes to the understanding of muscular motion and the role of the vascular system in animal physiology.
