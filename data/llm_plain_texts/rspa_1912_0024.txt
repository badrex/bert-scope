tldr: The author, Howard T. Barnes, investigates the so-called thermoid effect and the potential superheating of platinum-silver resistances used in continuous-flow calorimetry. He finds that the error due to superheating in his resistances is not more than 1 part in 10,000, confirming the accuracy of the continuous calorimetry method.
