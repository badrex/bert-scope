tldr: The author discusses ectomycorrhizas, nutrient-absorbing organs in trees, and their role in improving nutrient uptake. Ectomycorrhizas form a partnership between tree roots and fungi, increasing the surface area for nutrient absorption. The author explains how these structures affect nutrient uptake and how they are more efficient in low-nutrient environments. They also compare the absorption rates of mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal roots, showing that mycorrhizas absorb nutrients faster.
