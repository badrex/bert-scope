tldr: The author, Peter Barlow, discusses his experiments with fluid refracting telescopes and their potential for large instruments. He describes his eight-inch fluid telescope, which at the time was the largest refractor in England, and compares its performance with other telescopes. Barlow also explores the advantages of using sulphuret of carbon as a fluid in telescopes, such as its high dispersive power and the ability to reduce the telescope's length without increasing spherical aberration.
