tldr: This article discusses the magnetic rotation of the plane of polarization of light in doubly refracting bodies. The authors analyze the effects of double refraction and rotation on the plane of polarization and present a more accurate mathematical model for understanding these phenomena. They also address and correct some mistakes in a previous paper by Mr. A. W. Ward.
