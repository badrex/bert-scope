tldr: The author partitions an orthogonal group in six variables into disjoint sets, with 17 of these sets forming a subgroup. The study examines the properties of projectivities and their invariant subspaces, providing a method for partitioning the group. The paper demonstrates the rapidity and uniformity of the process once the results for an analogous group with one variable fewer are on record.
