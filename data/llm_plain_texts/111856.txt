tldr: The author presents a new method for symmetric products and applies it to solving equations, particularly quintic equations. They introduce a new cyclical symbol (s') that simplifies calculations and use it to derive the symmetric product for the complete quintic equation. This work builds on earlier research by the author and Arthur Cayley.
