tldr: The author conducted a study on the development and breeding of the tuatara (Sphenodon punctatum) in their natural habitat and in captivity. They discovered external differences between male and female tuataras, which helped in understanding their breeding patterns. The author found that captivity may interfere with their reproductive abilities, and suggested improving the living conditions to promote breeding success.
