tldr: The author examines the organization and vascular systems of fossil ferns and gymnospermous stems and seeds from the Carboniferous period. They describe the unique structure of the vascular cylinders and the presence of tylose, a tissue found in both recent and fossil plants. The study provides insights into the persistence of certain plant tissue types throughout geological time.
