tldr: The authors conducted a molecular dynamics simulation of SrCl2 to study the behavior of defects and their migration at various temperatures. They found that anion vacancies are more mobile than interstitials, and at higher temperatures, Frenkel defects form spontaneously on the anion sublattice. The simulation provides insights into the dynamic behavior of ions in the fast-ion region and helps understand the ionic conductivity in SrCl2.
