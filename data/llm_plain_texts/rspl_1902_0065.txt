tldr: This study investigates the process of metal fatigue and fracture in iron under repeated stress reversals. Using a microscope, the authors observe the formation of slip-bands and cracks in the material. They demonstrate that even stresses below the elastic limit can cause damage over time, eventually leading to fracture. The paper includes microphotographs of the destructive process.
