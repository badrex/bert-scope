revised_title: 'The Impact of Ionized Air on Bacterial Growth'
semantic_tags:
  - Bacteriology
  - Ionization
  - Air quality
  - Bacterial growth inhibition
  - Electrification
tldr: 'The author conducted experiments exposing bacteria to ionized air generated by positive and negative point discharges. They found that negatively charged air had a stronger bactericidal effect than positively charged air. This discovery could have implications for treating lung diseases like tuberculosis by inhibiting bacterial growth.'
