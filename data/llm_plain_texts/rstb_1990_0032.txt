tldr: 'This study investigates the influence of cold acclimation on the lipid composition and cryobehaviour of the plasma membrane in isolated rye protoplasts. Cold acclimation alters the lipid composition, increasing the cryostability of the plasma membrane and making it more resistant to freezing injury. The changes in lipid composition are crucial for the increased freezing tolerance in plants.'
