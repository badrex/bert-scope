tldr: The authors discovered two new species of coccolithophorids, Turrisphaera borealis and Turrisphaera arctica, living in extremely cold Arctic waters. These tiny organisms have unique calcified scales called coccoliths, which help them survive in such harsh conditions. The researchers used various microscopy techniques to study the organisms' structure and distribution, suggesting that the Northwest Passage could be a significant migration route for these species between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.
