tldr: 'This article explores the use of molecular phylogenies to study the relationship between pocket gophers and their chewing lice, focusing on the cospeciation and coevolution of the two species. The authors use DNA sequences from the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene to build phylogenetic trees for both hosts and parasites, and discuss the implications of these findings for understanding the evolution of host-parasite systems.'
