tldr: This study investigates the semidiurnal tides of Port Leopold in the Arctic Seas. The author calculates the eccentricity of the moon's orbit, the ratio of solar to lunar coefficients, and the depth of the Atlantic Ocean using tidal theories. The results provide a better understanding of the tides and their impact on the Arctic Seas.
