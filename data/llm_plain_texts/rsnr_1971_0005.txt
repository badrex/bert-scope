tldr: This paper explores the relationship between natural philosophy, religion, and politics in Edinburgh during the French Revolution, focusing on the contrasting political activities, philosophical attitudes, and religious positions of Professors John Robison and John Playfair. Robison's book, "Proofs of a conspiracy against all the religions and governments of Europe," fueled anti-French sentiment and suspicion of reformist ideas in Scotland during this time.
