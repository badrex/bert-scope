tldr: The author, Edwin Lee, argues that the brain is the sole center of the human nervous system and the source of its power. He disagrees with other physiologists who believe that portions of the nervous system are isolated and independent. Lee cites various opinions and pathological illustrations to support his view, including instances of anencephalous infants.
