tldr: The author presents two innovative devices for measuring ocean depths and collecting water samples from the sea. The first device uses a weighted ball and a wire to measure the time it takes for the ball to sink and resurface, allowing for depth calculations. The second device is a wooden bucket with a special bottom that can be opened and closed to collect water samples from different depths. These tools can help sailors determine the depth of the sea, locate sweet water sources, and study ocean currents.
