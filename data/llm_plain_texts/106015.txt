tldr: This article discusses experiments conducted on animal fluids in an exhausted receiver to understand their behavior under varying atmospheric pressures. The experiments showed that blood and other fluids expand when placed in a vacuum, debunking the idea that an elastic vapor exists in blood vessels. The findings also suggested that animal bodies can withstand greater atmospheric pressure variations than previously thought.
