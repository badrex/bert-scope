tldr: In 1694, Edward Floyd reported a mysterious event in which several hayricks and houses were burned by a fiery exhalation or damp, and the grass in the area became infected, causing it to be lethal to cattle that fed on it. The phenomenon lasted for a fortnight or three weeks and affected a mile or more around the site. Floyd sought explanations and remedies for this strange occurrence.
