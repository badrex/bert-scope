tldr: The author conducted experiments on plant petioles and stems to test the transverse growth theory of plant torsions. They found that when petioles were stimulated transversely by gravity and prevented from twisting, the lateral halves of the cortical tissues curved upwards, developing opposite twisting forces. The dorsal half, or the auxinated half, prevailed, causing the organ to twist in the observed direction. These findings support the transverse growth theory, which explains the mechanism of response in plant strophisms and auxin torsions.
