tldr: This article examines the strength and composition of various purging waters, particularly that of Jessop's Well. The author, Stephen Hales, compares the strength of water samples from different depths in the well and finds that the water near the bottom is stronger than that near the surface. The study also discusses the medicinal properties of the water, its effects on the human body, and its potential benefits for health.
