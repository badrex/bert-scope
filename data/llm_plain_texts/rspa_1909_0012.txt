tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the velocity and penetrating power of cathode rays ejected by substances exposed to y-rays of radium. They used different methods, such as measuring the scattering of cathode particles and ionization in chambers, to analyze the properties of the secondary radiation. The results showed that the radiation was heterogeneous, with some rays being more easily absorbed than others. The author also investigated the effect of different materials on the radiation and found that the radiation from a sheet of paper and a sheet of aluminum foil produced similar amounts of secondary radiation.
