tldr: The author conducted experiments on frog eyes to study the response of various tissues to induction shocks and the relationship between "blaze currents" and vitality in tissues. They found that the response to single induction shocks was smaller in the galvanometer than in the capillary electrometer, and that the "blaze currents" were not solely due to polarization effects. The author also discovered that the extent of the excursion increased with the duration and strength of the illumination and that the "blaze currents" were independent of the effects produced by light.
