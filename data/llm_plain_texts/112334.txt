tldr: In December 1862, a magnetic disturbance occurred, which was registered by Kew magnetographs and accompanied by an auroral display and earth-currents. The author, Balfour Stewart, studied the earth-currents and magnetic disturbances, comparing the curves and discussing the two hypotheses of direct and induced action. The study found that the hypothesis of induced action, where the earth-current effect depends on the rate of change of the disturbing force, was more favorable, as the most abrupt magnetic disturbances were accompanied by the greatest earth-currents.
