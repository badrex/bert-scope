tldr: The authors describe the instruments and processes used in a series of experiments on the specific inductive capacity of paraffin and the effect of temperature variations. They employed a Quadrant Electrometer and two other instruments, the Platymeter and the Sliding Condenser, to measure the electrostatic capacity of various condensers. The experiments aimed to improve understanding of dielectrics and their properties, which is essential for the development of electrical technologies.
