tldr: 'Dr. R. D. Kleeman and Prof. W. H. Bragg conducted experiments to study the ionization of various gases by the beta-rays of actinium. They discovered that the ionization values for different gases were similar when exposed to actinium's beta-rays and uranium's beta-rays. The results showed that the relative atomic ionizations and relative atomic absorptions for atoms up to tin were approximately independent of the velocity of the beta-rays over a certain range.'
