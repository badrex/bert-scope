tldr: The author describes experiments conducted on vipers and their venom. They found that vipers' venom is not just in their teeth but also in their heads. The experiments also showed that swallowing a viper's head does not protect against a viper bite. The author also mentions a new tuning for the lira viol invented by Signor Salvetti and his interest in optics and telescope-making.
