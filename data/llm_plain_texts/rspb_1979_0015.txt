revised_title: 'Intracellular Potassium Ion Activity in Resting and Stimulated Mouse Pancreas and Submandibular Gland'
semantic_tags:
  - Cellular potassium ion activity
  - Pancreas
  - Submandibular gland
  - Sodium transport
  - Membrane potential
tldr: The authors studied the intracellular potassium ion activity in resting and stimulated mouse pancreas and submandibular gland. They found that bethanechol, a cholinergic agonist, caused a decrease in potassium ion activity in the submandibular gland but not in the pancreas. The results support the view that electrogenic sodium pumping occurs in pancreatic cells.
