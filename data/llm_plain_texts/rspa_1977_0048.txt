tldr: The authors found a class of exact interior solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell equations representing pressure-free charged matter rotating with constant angular velocity about an axis of symmetry. These solutions are expressed in terms of an arbitrary solution of the flat-space Laplace equation and can be used to study the balance of forces acting on charged particles in the presence of gravity, electric, magnetic, and centrifugal forces.
