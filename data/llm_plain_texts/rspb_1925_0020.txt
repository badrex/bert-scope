tldr: The authors conducted experiments on fish to study the effect of removing the principal islets (isletectomy) on blood sugar levels. They found that isletectomy could induce a diabetic condition in fish, and that the blood sugar levels varied significantly depending on the treatment and conditions of the fish. This research provided insights into the metabolism of carbohydrates in cold-blooded animals and the role of insulin in regulating blood sugar.
