tldr: The author introduces the concept of autopolar polyhedra, which are polyhedra where the number, rank, and arrangement of their faces and remaining vertices are the same as those of their vertices and remaining faces. The author also discusses the properties of autopolar polyhedra, such as gamic pairs, polarity, and syntypic relationships. These concepts help to better understand the structure and symmetry of polyhedra.
