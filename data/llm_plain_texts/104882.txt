tldr: The author, Henry Miles, conducted a study comparing the temperature readings of two thermometers placed inside and outside his chamber. He observed a significant difference in temperature readings between the two thermometers, especially during a sudden change in weather conditions. This led him to question the usefulness of indoor thermometers for determining outdoor temperatures and suggested that external factors, such as subterranean heat and wind direction, may influence temperature changes.
