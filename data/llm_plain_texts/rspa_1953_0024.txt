tldr: The authors present a statistical approach to interpret the results of fatigue tests, considering the distribution of cracks and the effects of inelasticity and surface conditions on the specimens. They apply the theory of extreme values to the interpretation of observed frequencies of survival at any stress amplitude and provide methods for computing the survivorship function parameters from fatigue data.
