tldr: The author investigates the resonant nonlinear oscillations of an ideal gas contained in a cylindrical shell, excited by a harmonically oscillating line source and symmetric, harmonic displacement of the cylinder wall. The study provides a comparison between the response curve of the cylindrical shell and the analogous one in a spherical shell, and derives asymptotic solutions for small but finite excitation amplitudes in the resonant response.
