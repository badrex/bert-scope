tldr: The authors investigated the hyperfine structure and nuclear moments of aluminium using the method of absorption in an atomic beam. They determined the nuclear spin of aluminium and its magnetic moment, providing valuable insights into the atomic and nuclear properties of the element. Their findings contribute to the understanding of the behaviour of atoms and nuclei, which is essential for various scientific and technological applications.
