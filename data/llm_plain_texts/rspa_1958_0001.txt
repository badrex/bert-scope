tldr: This article presents an experimental test of the theory of intensity interferometry for partially coherent light. The authors investigate the correlation between fluctuations in the outputs of two photoelectric detectors and demonstrate how this correlation depends on the equipment parameters and the geometry of the experiment. The results of the experiment are compared with the theory, showing good agreement within the limits of accuracy.
