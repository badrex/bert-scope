tldr: The authors investigate the effects of electron correlation on the ground states of first row hydrides (BH, CH, NH, OH, and FH) using the self-consistent molecular orbital method. They introduce a modification to the method, the intra-atomic correlation correction, to account for the correlation between electrons closely associated in both the molecule and separated atoms. The study provides a more accurate analysis of the molecules' binding energies, wave functions, and dipole moments.
