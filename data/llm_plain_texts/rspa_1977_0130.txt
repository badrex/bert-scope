tldr: The authors extend their previous work on scalar quantum particle production by moving mirrors in two-dimensional flat space-time to models with asymptotically null trajectories. They demonstrate that Hawking's derivation of quantum particle emission from black holes using ray-tracing is mathematically identical to the geometrical optics associated with a certain class of mirror trajectory. The study clarifies the relation between particles and energy in quantum field theory and reveals the presence of radiated matter.
