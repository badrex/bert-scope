tldr: The author conducted experiments on the clear zone eye of the Ephestia moth to understand its function and optical properties. They measured the radius of curvature of the facets and the refractive indices of different parts of the eye. The results showed that the eye does not function according to Exner's mechanism of superposition, and the author proposed alternative explanations for the eye's function.
