tldr: This article investigates the kinetics of the hydrogen-oxygen reaction and the explosion-limit equation. The authors evaluate the various constants in the equation and compare experimental values with theoretical expectations. They examine aspects of the reaction, such as vessel-size effects, overall reaction mechanisms, activation energy, surface chain-breaking efficiencies, and the effects of inert gases and sensitizers. The study provides a better understanding of the hydrogen/oxygen explosion region under different conditions.
