tldr: The article investigates the minimum local temperature disturbance required to ignite a reactive slab close to criticality. It extends previous research on two-dimensional disturbances and determines that three-dimensional disturbances can tolerate larger local temperature excursions before thermal runaway occurs. The study uses the method of large activation-energy asymptotics to analyze temperature and concentration within the infinite reacting slab.
