tldr: The author investigates the size variations in different parts of the shore crab (Carcinus mænas) in two samples from the Bay of Naples and Plymouth Sound. They find that the observed deviations from the average size of each organ are grouped symmetrically around the average and occur with a frequency corresponding to the probability integral. The study also explores the correlation between pairs of organs and suggests that the female Carcinus mænas is slightly dimorphic in Naples with respect to its frontal breadth.
