revised_title: 'Somatic Activity and Dynamics of the Mariner Transposable Element in Drosophila simulans Populations'

tldr: The study investigates the somatic activity and dynamics of the Mariner transposable element in natural populations of Drosophila simulans from various parts of the world. The somatic excision rate and average number of copies varied widely within and between populations. The study found a correlation between the excision rate and temperature, suggesting that temperature could play a role in regulating Mariner somatic excision in D. simulans.
