tldr: The author presents a new technique for solving the problem of diffraction of electromagnetic plane waves by metallic sheets. The method reduces the original boundary-value problem into two independent boundary-value problems, which can be solved using known solutions. The technique is applicable to the case of oblique incidence on an imperfectly conducting half-plane and can be extended to boundary-value problems involving parallel sheets of imperfectly conducting material.
