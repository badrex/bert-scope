tldr: The authors explore the correlation between homogamy and fertility using statistical analysis. They find that fertility is not a random character but depends on the relative size of the husband and wife, supporting the concept of genetic selection. However, the study is limited by the small number of observations, and further research is needed to confirm the findings.
