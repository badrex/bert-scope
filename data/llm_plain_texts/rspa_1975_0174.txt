tldr: The authors present a numerical solution method for determining oil film shape and pressure in the lubricated contact between an elastic sphere and an elastic plane. They assume steady loading and an isothermal film, solving the Reynolds and elasticity equations simultaneously for a pressure-viscosity characteristic lubricant. The study provides a comprehensive understanding of the elasto-hydrodynamic point contact problem, which is essential for improving the performance of mechanical components.
