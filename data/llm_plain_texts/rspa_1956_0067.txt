tldr: This study investigates the photometric measurements of alkali metals in oxygen flame gases, diluted with various proportions of nitrogen, to determine the concentration of hydrogen atoms that persist in these gases after primary combustion. The findings reveal that these concentrations are in excess of those expected from thermodynamic equilibrium, especially at lower temperatures. The research also discusses the mechanisms responsible for the ultimate equilibration of these excess radical concentrations in hydrogen flame gases.
