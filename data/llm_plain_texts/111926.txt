tldr: The author's experiments demonstrate that the rate of burning for self-supporting combustibles, like time-fuses, is affected by atmospheric pressure. The time of combustion increases as pressure decreases. This phenomenon occurs because the rate of fusion of the combustible composition is diminished by the more rapid removal of heated gases from the surface of the composition. The author also investigates the effect of atmospheric pressure on the light of combustion and finds that the decrease in illuminating power is directly proportional to the decrease in atmospheric pressure.
