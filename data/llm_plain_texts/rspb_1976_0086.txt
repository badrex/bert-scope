tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the changes in target cell susceptibility during the cell cycle in T cell mediated cytotoxicity. They found that mastocytoma P815 shows higher susceptibility to specific anti-H2d cytotoxic T cells during the early phases of the cell cycle. The changes in H2d antigen density and susceptibility to T cells vary independently. Meth A, a methylcholanthrene-induced tumor, shows no changes in susceptibility to T cell cytotoxicity during the cell cycle. These findings suggest that the greater susceptibility to T cell cytotoxicity during the G1 phase is not a trivial consequence of increased sensitivity or directly related to changes in antigen density.
