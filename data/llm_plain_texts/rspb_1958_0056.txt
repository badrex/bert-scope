tldr: Researchers attempted to induce gynogenesis in mice by treating sperm with trypaflavine, toluidine blue, or nitrogen mustard before fertilization. While these chemicals reduced sperm activity and affected fertilization rates, only a few haploid or near-haploid embryos were found, and their gynogenetic nature was not confirmed. The results contrast with those obtained for amphibians.
