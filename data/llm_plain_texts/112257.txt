tldr: The author presents a theory for calculating strains in beams and applies it to various scenarios, such as beams supported at both ends or projecting from a wall. The theory uses the Calculus of Variations and provides numerical values for the principal forces and angles in different cases, helping to understand the behavior of beams under stress.
