tldr: The authors investigate the structure of silicates and the role of oxygen in their crystalline arrangement. They propose that silicates can be seen as "coordinated structures of ions packed together" and describe the different types of ions and their positions within the crystal lattice. The study provides insights into the properties and behavior of silicate minerals.
