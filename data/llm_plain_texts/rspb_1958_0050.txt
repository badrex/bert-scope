tldr: The author studied the unique interaction between the parasite Viscum obscurum and its host Euphorbia polygona. They discovered that the parasite stimulated the host's xylem production and stretched the surrounding host tissues, leading to an increase in periderm formation. The author also found that the parasite's haustorium was embedded in host xylem and that its structure was formed by the activity of a cambial zone, which was continuous with the host's cambium.
