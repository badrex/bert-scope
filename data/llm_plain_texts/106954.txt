tldr: The author, William Charles Wells, conducted experiments to understand the cause of muscle contractions and the role of metals and moisture in the process. He found that muscle contractions were not caused by animal electricity, as previously suggested by Galvani, but rather by the interaction between metals and moisture. The author also discovered that charcoal could act as an exciter of this influence, but only when in contact with moisture and metals. This research contributed to the understanding of muscle contractions and the nature of bioelectricity.
