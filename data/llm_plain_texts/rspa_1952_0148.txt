semantic_tags:
  - Thermodynamics
  - Equilibrium
  - Affinity
  - Partial Differential Relations
  - Phase Transitions
tldr: The authors derive a general equation representing a small change in a two-phase, two-component system under equilibrium conditions. This equation can be used to calculate partial differential relations and thermodynamic properties in such systems, providing a better understanding of phase transitions and equilibrium behavior.
