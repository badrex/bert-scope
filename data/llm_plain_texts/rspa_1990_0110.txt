tldr: The author investigates the oscillatory behavior of the Sal'nikov thermokinetic oscillator, a model chemical reaction with two-stage decay. Using a simplified pool-chemical approximation, the author proves that sustained periodic oscillations are not possible for certain combinations of the defining physical parameters. A numerical solution technique is presented, which can compute stable and unstable periodic orbits, and extensive numerical investigation is conducted to discuss the occurrence of unstable limit cycles and multiple solutions.
