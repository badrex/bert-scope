tldr: The article provides a geometric interpretation of Kane's equations in the context of mechanics, focusing on the treatment of holonomic and non-holonomic constraints. It introduces a new notation and discusses the advantages of Kane's method in dealing with linear velocity constraints. The author also explains the connections between Kane's methods and more classical formulations, making it easier for those trained in traditional analytical mechanics to adopt the procedure.
