tldr: The author examines the corrosion and chemical changes that have occurred in ancient copper alloys, such as a bronze helmet and coins from the Mediterranean region. The study reveals the composition of the alloys and the formation of crystalline structures due to the action of chemical affinities over time. The findings have practical applications in determining the authenticity of ancient works of art.
