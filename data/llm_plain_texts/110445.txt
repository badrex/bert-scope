tldr: The author, John Bishop, investigates the cause of the grave and acute tones of the human voice. He refutes previous theories and explains that the modulation of voice tones is not due to variations in the length, tension, or size of the vocal cords or the glottis. Instead, he demonstrates that the tone of the sound emitted depends on the length of the vibrating portions of the vocal cords, similar to the way stringed musical instruments produce sound. He also discusses the comparative physiology of the voice and its superiority in humans.
