tldr: This study examines the genetic similarities and differences between populations living at high and low altitudes in Ethiopia. Despite significant anatomical and physiological differences, the researchers found that the only statistically significant genetic difference was in the frequencies of red-cell 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase variants, which they concluded was likely accidental and not due to natural selection. The study highlights the importance of environmental factors in shaping human populations and the need for further research on the effects of altitude on human health.
