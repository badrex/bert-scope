tldr: Thomas Beddoes describes experiments conducted by Mr. Walker on producing artificial cold using various chemical combinations. Walker discovered that mixing sal ammoniac, nitre, and Glauber's salt could produce a greater degree of cold than when used separately. These experiments led to the freezing of water, spirits, and even mercury, with the potential for future applications in various scientific fields.
