tldr: The study investigates the response of astrocytes in the rat optic nerve to the neurotransmitter GABA. The research shows that the astrocyte response to GABA attenuates with age, with astrocytes in 21-day-old nerves not responding to GABA. This suggests a transient presence of functional GABAa receptors in developing rat optic nerve astrocytes and a potential role for GABA in glial signaling and axon-glial interrelations during development.
