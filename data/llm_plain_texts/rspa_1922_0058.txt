tldr: This obituary highlights the life and scientific achievements of Gabriel Lippmann, who made significant contributions to electro-capillarity, color photography, the coelostat, pendulum clocks, and the isostacy of the earth's crust. Lippmann's work in color photography led to the development of a process that could reproduce colors accurately through photography, while his coelostat invention allowed for extended photographic exposure of a stationary area in the sky.
