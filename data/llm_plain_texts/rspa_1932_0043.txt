tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the state of water in gelatin gels. They found that the amount of water associated with each gram of dry gelatin increases rapidly as the water's activity approaches unity. The results show that the behavior of gelatin gel depends on the direct interaction between gelatin and water, and the freezing equilibrium curve is independent of the rate of cooling.
