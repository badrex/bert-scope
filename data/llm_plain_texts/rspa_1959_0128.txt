tldr: The authors developed a theory to describe the behavior of a heavy ball moving down a vertical tube filled with a viscous fluid. They found that the ball takes up an eccentric position in the tube, which requires a particular velocity of rotation. The eccentricity corresponding to minimum energy dissipation for a given velocity of descent is determined, and experiments were conducted to verify the prediction.
