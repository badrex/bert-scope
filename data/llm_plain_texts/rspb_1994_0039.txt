revised_title: 'Phantom Limb Perceptions as Indicators of Neural Plasticity in the Mature Human Brain'

tldr: The study investigates three lower limb amputees who experienced phantom sensations and found that somatic stimuli delivered to skin regions near the stump were mislocalized to specific points on the phantom limb. This phenomenon, which is a result of new functional connections between the deprived areas and adjacent ones, suggests dynamic neural remodeling in the mature nervous system.
