tldr: The authors study the steady motion of an incompressible fluid through a curved tube of circular cross-section. They extend Dean's work on this topic and use a Fourier-series development to solve the resulting non-linear equations. The research covers a range of Reynolds numbers from 96 to over 600, showing the significant impact of secondary flow on the location of maximum axial velocity and the reduction in flow due to curvature. This work is particularly relevant to understanding laminar flow patterns in the cardiovascular system.
