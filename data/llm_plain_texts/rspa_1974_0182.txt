tldr: The authors studied the effect of hydrogen bromide on the products of cool-flame combustion of n-pentane. They found that hydrogen bromide increases the yield of C5 ketones while decreasing the formation of alkenes, aldehydes, and other products. The results indicate that hydrogen bromide alters the reaction mechanism by providing a source of readily abstractable hydrogen, enhancing the formation of pentenemonohydroperoxides.
