tldr: The article describes a new dipnoan species, Sorbitorhynchus deleaskitus, found in the Lower Devonian of Guangxi, China. The well-preserved head provides new insights into the early evolution of the dipnoan group, reinforcing the concept of two independently developing dentine-plated lines. This discovery adds to the understanding of the early Devonian fish fauna in the region and contributes to the study of fish evolution.
