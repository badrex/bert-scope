tldr: This study investigates isotope shifts and hyperfine structure in the atomic spectrum of platinum. The researchers measured two spectral lines and found no evidence for large specific mass effects. They calculated the differences in the mean square radius of the proton distribution for platinum isotopes and discussed the contribution of nuclear deformation to the shifts. The results provide valuable information on changes in nuclear charge distribution and help compare with other elements like mercury.
