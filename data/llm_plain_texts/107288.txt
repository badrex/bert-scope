tldr: The author, Nevil Maskelyne, discovered a new property of tangents in a plane triangle with three arches trisecting the circumference of a circle. He found that the square of the radius multiplied by the sum of the tangents of the three arches is equal to the product of the tangents multiplied together. This property can be understood through the use of symbolical expressions and analytic calculation.
