tldr: This study investigates the explosive reaction between hydrogen and oxygen sensitized by nitrogen dioxide, chlorine, and bromine using flash photolysis techniques. The results show that the addition of these sensitizers affects the chain branching mechanism and thermal contribution to the explosion. The authors also observe the temperature of the system during the reaction and discuss the differences between flash photolytic and conventional systems.
