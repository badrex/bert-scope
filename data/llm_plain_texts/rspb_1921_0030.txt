tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effects of constant galvanic currents on mammalian nerve-muscle and reflex preparations. They found that continuous excitation can be obtained during the passage of a descending current of sufficient strength, while the muscle remains quiescent if the current is ascending. The results provide insights into the reactions given by nerve-muscle preparations of cold-blooded and warm-blooded animals and help explain the closure and opening tetanus seen in mammals.
