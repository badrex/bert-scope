tldr: This study investigates the ionization potentials of unsaturated polycyclic hydrocarbons using photoelectron spectroscopy and several semi-empirical methods. The authors compare the results of four theoretical methods, MINDO (1), MINDO (11), MINDO (1) with localized electrons, and MINDO (11) with delocalized electrons. They discuss the accuracy of these methods in predicting ionization potentials and heats of formation for the molecules studied. The findings can help improve our understanding of the structures and spectra of molecular complexes.
