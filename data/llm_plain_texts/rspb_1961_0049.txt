tldr: The article explores 6-aminopenicillanic acid as a substrate for penicillinase and an inducer of penicillinase formation. It compares the hydrolysis rates of 6-aminopenicillanic acid and benzylpenicillin by penicillinase and discusses the differences in their optima and Michaelis constants. The study shows that 6-aminopenicillanic acid is a more effective inducer of penicillinase formation than benzylpenicillin.
