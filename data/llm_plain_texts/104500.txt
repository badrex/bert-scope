tldr: This article discusses experiments conducted on unannealed glass vessels, which are extremely fragile and break easily. The author, M. Allamand, explores the factors that cause these glasses to break, such as the weight and type of objects dropped into them. He also notes that the thickness of the glass bottom affects its fragility. The article highlights the unique properties of unannealed glass and the importance of annealing in making glass vessels more durable.
