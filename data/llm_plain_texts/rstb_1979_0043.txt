tldr: This article discusses the assessment of sublethal effects of pollutants on marine poikilotherms, focusing on their behavioral responses. It highlights the importance of studying behavioral changes in marine organisms as indicators of pollutant-induced stress. The article also reviews various studies on the effects of pollutants such as heavy metals, pesticides, and petroleum on the behavior of marine fishes and invertebrates. It suggests that behavioral responses, while not widely studied, could be valuable in establishing marine water quality criteria and monitoring industrial effluents and surface water quality.
