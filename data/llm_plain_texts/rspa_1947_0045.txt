tldr: The author investigates the simple group of order 25920, focusing on the geometry and configurations of the 45 nodes and their associated Jordan primes. They describe various types of lines, planes, and primes that make up the configuration and discuss the properties of these elements. This study helps to better understand the group and its subgroups.
