semantic_tags:
  - Calculus of symbols
  - Partial differential equations
  - Functional equations
  - Linear algebra
  - Mathematical analysis
tldr: The author applies the calculus of symbols to solve linear partial differential equations and functional equations. They demonstrate how certain algebraic quantities combine with symbols of partial differentiation, expanding the range of their use. The author also provides examples of internal and external division, and applies the method to solve functional equations.
