tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the behavior of turbulent fluid motion near a solid surface. They used a modified Pitot tube to measure the fluid's velocity close to the wall and found evidence of a thin layer of fluid in streamline motion near the boundary. The results suggest that there might be a finite amount of slip at the boundary, but further research is needed to confirm this.
