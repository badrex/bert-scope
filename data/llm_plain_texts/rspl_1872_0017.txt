tldr: The author conducted experiments on the Britannia and Conway tubular iron bridges to study the magnetic disturbances caused by the perpetual tremor in the iron structures. The observations were made in various stations along the bridges, and the results showed that the transversal and vertical parts of terrestrial magnetism were neutralized, while the longitudinal force was diminished by about one fourth part. The study also highlighted an anomaly in the Anglesey Water-tube, which was attributed to a previous accident during the construction of the bridge.
