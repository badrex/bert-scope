tldr: The article discusses the inhibition of adenosine deaminase and platelet aggregation by 2-azidoadenosine, a photolysable analogue of adenosine. The study shows that 2-azidoadenosine competes with adenosine for binding sites on adenosine deaminase, leading to its inhibition. Additionally, the compound inhibits platelet aggregation induced by ADP. The researchers also demonstrate that 2-azidoadenosine can be used as a photoaffinity label for the enzyme adenosine deaminase.
