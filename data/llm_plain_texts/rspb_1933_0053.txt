tldr: This study investigates the effect of stimulation frequency on heat production in frog nerve. The authors found that the heat production per impulse decreases with increasing frequency and that the time scale of nerve is reduced about three times during steady stimulation. The results show that nerve behaves as if it is slowed in its time relations by activity, with the heat production per impulse falling considerably within one minute of beginning high-frequency stimulation.
