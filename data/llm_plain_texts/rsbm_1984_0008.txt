tldr: Hans Gruneberg was a pioneering geneticist who made significant contributions to the field of mammalian and human genetics. Born in Germany, he migrated to England in 1933 and spent his life working at University College London. Gruneberg's research focused on X-ray induced mutations, mouse genetics, and the use of mice as a model for human genetic defects. His work was supported by the Medical Research Council and the Rockefeller Foundation. Throughout his career, Gruneberg established a reputation as an authority on mammalian genetics and made important discoveries in the field.
