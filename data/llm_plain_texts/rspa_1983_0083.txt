tldr: This article examines the nature and correlation of random distributions from an experimental physicist's perspective. By plotting the logarithm of frequency against an additive variate scale, the author reveals that many random distributions have straight-line asymptotes and are not symmetrical, challenging the widely accepted Gaussian distribution. The author suggests that a single natural process may govern random distributions, and deviations may be due to systematic tendencies or mixed distributions.
