tldr: The author explains how to determine the Moon's distance and Earth's mass using Sir Isaac Newton's law of gravitation. They describe a method to calculate the Moon's distance in semidiameters of the Earth and estimate the Earth's mass in relation to the Moon's mass. This method involves using a simple pendulum, the Moon's parallax, and the Earth's semidiameter. The author also discusses the effect of the Earth's spheroid figure and the Moon's attractive force on the ocean tides.
