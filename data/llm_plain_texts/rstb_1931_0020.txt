tldr: The authors discovered that certain species of Aspergillus fungi can produce mannitol from glucose through fermentation. They found that some species yielded up to 50% of the original glucose as mannitol, making it a potentially valuable method for mannitol production. The study also highlighted the importance of aeration and controlled conditions for optimal results.
