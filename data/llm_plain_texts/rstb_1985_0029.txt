tldr: This article discusses the different types of opioid receptors and their roles in nociception and pain. The authors analyze the endogenous opioid peptides and their interactions with the mu, delta, and kappa receptors. They also explore the importance of selective non-endogenous opioid agonists and antagonists in understanding the physiological functions of these receptors. The article highlights the need for further research to determine the clinical implications of these findings in pain management.
