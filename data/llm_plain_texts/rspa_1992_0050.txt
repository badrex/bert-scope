tldr: This study investigates the mechanical properties and matrix cracking behavior of SiC-CAS composites reinforced with Nicalon fibers. The elastic properties of the composites are close to the values predicted from constituent properties, but their strengths are lower than expected due to degraded fibers during manufacturing. The fracture energy is higher than predicted, and the matrix cracking stress can be reasonably predicted by the Aveston, Cooper, and Kelly model of cracking in brittle matrix composites.
