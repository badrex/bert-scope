tldr: The authors discuss the results from the first Anglo-American satellite, Ariel I, and related observations of the solar spectrum in the wavelength band 4 to 14 Å. They analyze the variations in the short-wavelength 'tail' of the solar X-ray spectrum under non-flare and flare-active conditions. The study highlights the impact of solar X-rays on the Earth's ionosphere and the importance of obtaining more detailed experimental data on solar emission for further progress in understanding the solar X-ray emission mechanism.
