tldr: This article discusses the high-power definition achieved through a compressed Podura-scale using a Hundlaeh Herman immersion lens. The authors, E. B. Beaumont and Dr. Royston-Pigott, also explore the role of the ciliary muscle and the iris in accommodation and vision. The study provides insights into the mechanics of the eye and the potential for further improvements in microscopy.
