tldr: 'Albert Abraham Michelson was a renowned physicist who made significant contributions to the field of physical optics and the study of light. He conducted refined measurements and developed interferometry methods to measure the velocity of light and the wavelength of light. Michelson's work on the Michelson-Morley experiment, the study of light in refracting media, and the determination of the standard meter using light wavelengths made him one of the highest authorities in physical optics.'
