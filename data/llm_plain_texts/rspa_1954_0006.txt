tldr: This article presents theoretical methods to solve mass transfer equations in laminar flow, focusing on forced convection from a flat plate, natural convection from a vertical flat plate, and the forward stagnation point of a sphere in a fluid stream. The authors apply boundary-layer equations and polynomial velocity and mass profiles to derive expressions for mass transfer rates and boundary-layer thicknesses.
