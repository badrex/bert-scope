tldr: The article explores the evolution of cheilostome bryozoans and the role of branching and biomechanics in their growth. It discusses how the development of rigid, arborescent growth habits allowed these organisms to expand their ecological opportunities and increase in abundance and diversity. The study examines the skeletal strength, branching geometry, and behavior in water flow of arborescent colonies, and how these factors have evolved over time. The research suggests that as more cheilostome stocks developed the ability to grow erect, the strength of their skeletal material became less important as the mechanical design of the skeleton improved, and branching geometry evolved to minimize crowding.
