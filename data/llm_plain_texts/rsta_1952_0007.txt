tldr: This article describes an experimental study of the collapse of fluid columns and the base surge phenomenon observed after atomic bomb explosions. The authors investigate the motion of surges produced by the collapse of liquid, homogeneous, right-circular cylinders in a medium of comparable density. They use simple scaling laws to estimate the quantity of finely divided water in the column of the Bikini plume and analyze the motion of the surge front.
