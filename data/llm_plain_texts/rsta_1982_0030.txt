tldr: The authors study the evolution of Late Palaeozoic sedimentary basins in the southern U.S. continental interior, linking their formation to a sequence of collisional events in the Appalachian-Ouachita-Marathon orogenic belt. They identify different basin types, such as the Appalachian, Black Warrior, and Arkoma Basins, and discuss their subsidence history, deformation, and hydrocarbon maturation. The McKenzie (1978) stretching model is used to explain the evolution of these basins and their crustal structure.
