tldr: The study investigates the role of parvocellular neurons in motion perception in human peripheral vision. The researchers found that the sampling density of ganglion cells limits motion acuity in peripheral vision, even for high-velocity targets. This provides evidence that the parvocellular pathway is involved in processing information about motion.
