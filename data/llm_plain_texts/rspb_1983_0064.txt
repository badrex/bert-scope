tldr: This study investigates the pollination process in the marine angiosperm Amphibolis antarctica. The research focuses on the attachment, germination, and behavior of submerged pollen in seagrasses. The findings reveal unique structural and cytochemical features in the pollen and stigmas of aquatic plants, providing insights into the functional reorganization necessary for successful hydrophilous pollination.
