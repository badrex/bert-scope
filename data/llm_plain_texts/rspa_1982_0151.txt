tldr: The authors studied a rapidly cooled sample of reduced rutile, TiO1.9985, using high-resolution electron microscopy. They observed crystallographic shear planes (c.s.p.) and other defects in three major projections, [111], [112], and [001]. The analysis revealed extensive disorder within the c.s.p., which could be sequenced and statistically analyzed. The results provide insights into the nature and extent of disorder in the material and may help in understanding reduction-deformation reaction mechanisms in reduced rutile and other systems.
