tldr: This article investigates the existence of multiple solutions in hydrodynamic problems, focusing on bifurcation phenomena in steady flows of a viscous fluid. The author develops a new rationale for the Taylor experiment on Couette flow between rotating cylinders, considering the effects of end conditions and selection among possible flows. The study provides new insights into the behavior of fluids and has implications for understanding complex fluid dynamics.
