tldr: This study investigates the effects of stimulating and removing the labyrinth of the ear on the motor system. The researchers found that stimulating the end organ of the vestibular nerve and destroying the labyrinth or eighth nerve can cause disturbances in motor coordination, eye movements, and sensations of rotation. These findings contribute to understanding the connection between the labyrinth and eye muscles, as well as the path of the vestibular-optic pathway.
