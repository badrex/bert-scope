tldr: The author investigates the use of bacterial endotoxins as a means of immunization against various diseases, including typhoid, cholera, diphtheria, and plague. They found that endotoxins can provide significant protection against the corresponding living organisms when injected into animals. This suggests that endotoxins could be valuable as protective or prophylactic vaccines. The author also notes that endotoxin solutions maintain their activity for at least six weeks and cause minimal side effects in human subjects.
