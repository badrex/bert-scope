tldr: The author, Sir Oliver J. Lodge, discusses a new method for producing a high-voltage continuous current using mercury-rectifiers. This method allows for the use of ordinary sources of supply, such as transformed currents from a main, and can also trap and store high-tension intermittent currents from a Ruhmkorff coil. The author proposes this method for discharging large quantities of electricity into the air to coagulate mist and fog.
