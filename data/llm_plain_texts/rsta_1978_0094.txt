tldr: This article examines the exposed limestones of the Northern Province of the Great Barrier Reef, specifically reef-rock, beach-rock, rampart-rock, boulder-rock, and phosphate-rock. The study focuses on the intertidal processes that create these limestone types and their relationship to the surrounding coral reef ecosystem. The article also discusses the distribution and formation of these rocks, as well as the impact of environmental factors on their development.
