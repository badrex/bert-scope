tldr: The authors reinvestigate the mechanism of acetaldehyde pyrolysis using high-purity acetaldehyde and propose a new reaction mechanism that includes additional reactions to the original Rice-Herzfeld scheme. They find that the initiation reaction is first order, and the main termination step is the combination of methyl radicals, which is second order. The results provide a better understanding of the reaction kinetics and the formation of minor products like acetone, propionaldehyde, and ethylene.
