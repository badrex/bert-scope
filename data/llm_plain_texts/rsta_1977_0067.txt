revised_title: 'Chemical Changes at Impact-Induced Phase Transitions on the Lunar Surface'
semantic_tags:
  - Lunar geology
  - Impact cratering
  - Shock metamorphism
  - Lunar regolith
  - Mineralogy
tldr: The authors analyze the chemical changes that occur during impact-induced phase transitions on the lunar surface. They discuss the formation of local melts and the selective melting of minerals due to shock pressures. The study also examines the distribution of chemical components in lunar rocks and glasses, and the possibility of volcanic origin for some glass particles in the regolith.
