tldr: The author, Theophilus Thompson, conducted a study on the effects of cod-liver oil, cocoa-nut oil, and other oils on the blood composition of patients with phthisis. He found that cod-liver oil and cocoa-nut oil increased the number of red corpuscles in the blood, suggesting potential health benefits. Cod-liver oil was found to be more effective than almond-oil and olive-oil, while cocoa-nut oil showed almost as much impact as cod-liver oil. The study also provided details on the process of obtaining pure cocoa oleine from cocoa-nut oil.
