tldr: The authors developed a non-steady-state method to measure the thermal conductivities of liquid polyphenyls. They used a line source technique with an electrically heated wire immersed in the liquid, allowing them to observe the development of temperature over time. The method provides accurate absolute determinations of thermal conductivity and can be used to compare the sensitivity of heat and momentum transport to molecular structure.
