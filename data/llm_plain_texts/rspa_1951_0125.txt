tldr: This article introduces a co-ordinate operator in the quantum mechanics of the electron, which differs from other works on the subject in the derivation of the operator by an analogy with the quantum expression for the angular momentum of the electron. The authors derive expressions for velocity and momentum operators and discuss the significance of the fifth co-ordinate in Kaluza's theory of the gravitational and electromagnetic field. They also introduce a new aspect of the quantization of space and time using co-ordinate operators.
