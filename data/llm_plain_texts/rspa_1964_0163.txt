tldr: This discussion explores the physical and biological changes that occur across the Antarctic Convergence, a boundary where cold Antarctic water meets warmer Subantarctic water. The authors examine the processes that create this boundary, its impact on the atmosphere and ocean currents, and the implications for the distribution of marine life in the region.
