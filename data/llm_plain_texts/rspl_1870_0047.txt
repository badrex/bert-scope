tldr: The author examines the effects of climate change on human physiology, particularly the excretion of fluids through the kidneys, lungs, and skin. They found that in tropical climates, the skin plays a more significant role in eliminating excess water, while the kidneys remain the primary eliminators. This information can be useful for understanding the impact of climate on human health and developing strategies to prevent or alleviate health issues related to fluid imbalances.
