tldr: 'William Ritchie invents a new photometer that accurately measures the relative intensities of artificial light. The photometer works by comparing the amount of heat produced by light passing through two identical chambers, one facing the light source and the other facing a black surface that absorbs the light and converts it to heat. The instrument can be used to compare the intensity of light from different sources, such as candles or gas lights, and even determine the relative quantities of light given off by different types of gas.'
