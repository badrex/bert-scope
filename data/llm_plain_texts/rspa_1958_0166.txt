tldr: This article presents a theoretical study of the fluorine molecule, focusing on parity non-conservation. The authors use the linear combinations of atomic orbitals self-consistent field (LCAO-SCF) method to calculate the ground state of the molecule and obtain approximations for ionization potentials, excitation energies, and the quadrupole moment. The study finds that the level of the fluorine molecule lies below the level, and discusses the implications of this finding.
