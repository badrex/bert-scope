tldr: This article is an erratum for a previous publication in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series B: Biological Sciences. It corrects a mistake in the original paper regarding a figure that should have been in color. The corrected figure illustrates differences in brain activation when processing fluency, specifically for initial letter and category fluency.
