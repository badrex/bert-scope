tldr: 'The author, Smithson Tennant, discovered that nitre can dissolve gold and platinum. He found that when nitre is heated with gold, a part of the gold is dissolved, and when heated with platinum, the platinum is easily dissolved. This research expanded the understanding of chemical reactions between metals and compounds.'
