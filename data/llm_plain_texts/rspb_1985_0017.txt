tldr: 'The author develops a mathematical model to demonstrate how a small increase in nutrient supply can cause a sudden shift in the stable state of a three-component ecosystem, consisting of algae, herbivores, and fish. The model shows how the addition of a curved line representing the limitations of the herbivores can lead to a stable coexistence of the three populations, resolving the issue of the initial disproportionate response to nutrient availability.'
