tldr: This article explores the Hamilton-Jacobi theory and its application to the quantization of generalized electrodynamics. The authors develop a procedure that extends the Hamilton-Jacobi theory to continuum physics and apply it to various cases of electrodynamics, including Maxwell's field, Born's field, and Mie's field. They demonstrate how the procedure leads to the quantization of these fields and discuss the implications of gauge invariance in electrodynamics.
