tldr: The article discusses phase transitions in the early Universe and their consequences. It explores the idea of grand unification and the inflationary universe model, which explains the observed values of certain constants. The author reviews the reasons for believing that several phase transitions occurred in the early Universe and examines their implications, including the explanation for the observed values of some constants in terms of the inflationary universe.
