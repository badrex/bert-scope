tldr: The authors conducted experiments using silver nitrate to determine the occurrence and distribution of chlorides in nerve fibers. They found that chlorides of sodium, calcium, and magnesium compounds were present in nerve tissue, specifically in the axons of nerve fibers. This discovery provided a clearer understanding of the structure and function of nerve fibers and their role in the nervous system.
