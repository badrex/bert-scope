His work contributed significantly to the understanding of insect anatomy and histology, and he developed innovative methods and apparatus for his research. Eltringham's dedication to his field and his impact on entomology is commemorated through his numerous publications and contributions to the Hope department of entomology at Oxford University Museum.'
