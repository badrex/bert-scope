tldr: The authors present a method to analyze and differentiate crystal structures using homogeneous X-rays and mathematical crystallography. They tabulate data for the 230 possible space-groups, which can help in understanding the arrangement of molecules in crystals and the effects of symmetry elements on crystal planes' periodicity.
