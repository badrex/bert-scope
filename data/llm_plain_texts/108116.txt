revised_title: On the Determination of Secular Inequalities in Celestial Mechanics
semantic_tags:
  - Celestial mechanics

  - Perturbation theory
  - Mathematical physics
tldr: The author investigates the terms in the disturbing function of the fourth order concerning eccentricities and inclinations that cause secular inequalities in celestial mechanics. They develop a method to calculate these terms and provide analytical expressions for the secular inequalities resulting from them. This work contributes to a better understanding of the behavior of celestial bodies and their orbits.
