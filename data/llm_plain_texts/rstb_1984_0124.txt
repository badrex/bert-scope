tldr: The authors investigated the ability of specific DNA segments from Drosophila chorion gene regions to induce tissue-specific amplification when inserted into new chromosomal sites using P element-mediated transformation. They found that certain transduced chorion DNA sequences initiated a pattern of tissue-specific differential replication similar to normal chorion amplification. This suggests that differential chorion DNA replication is mediated by specific origin-containing sequences located near the center of the amplified domains.
