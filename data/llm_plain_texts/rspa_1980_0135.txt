tldr: The authors present a method for simulating electrostatic systems in periodic boundary conditions, focusing on lattice sums and dielectric constants. They discuss the use of convergence factors to handle conditionally convergent series and evaluate the effective interactions of ions, dipoles, and higher-order multipoles under periodic boundary conditions. The study includes a report on the simulation of a dense fluid of hard spheres with embedded point dipoles, demonstrating the influence of the dielectric constant on the system's behavior.
