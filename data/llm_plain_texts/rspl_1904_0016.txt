tldr: The authors conducted experiments on cats to study the effects of joining the cervical sympathetic nerve with the chorda tympani. They found that vaso-constrictor nerve fibers can connect with peripheral vaso-dilator nerve cells and become vaso-dilator fibers. The mode of nerve-ending determines whether contraction or inhibition of the unstriated muscle of arteries occurs on nerve stimulation. This research also showed that some nerve fibers can connect with peripheral secretory nerve cells of the chorda tympani.
