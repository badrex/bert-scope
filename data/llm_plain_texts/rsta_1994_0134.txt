tldr: This article discusses the isotopic chemistry of carbon in Martian meteorites, focusing on the analysis of samples using the stepped combustion technique. The authors study the different forms of carbon found in these meteorites, such as low-temperature carbon components LC1 and LC2, and their isotopic compositions. The research helps to understand the origin and evolution of surface processes on Mars.
