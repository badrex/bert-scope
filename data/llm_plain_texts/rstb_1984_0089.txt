tldr: The article discusses the activation of the first component of the complement system, C1, which plays a crucial role in the immune response. The authors describe the structure and function of C1's subcomponents, Clq, Clr, and Cls, and how they interact with each other and with activators such as immune complexes. They also explore the autoactivation potential of Clr and the process of C1 activation, which is essential for the formation of the C3 convertase in the classical pathway of the complement system.
