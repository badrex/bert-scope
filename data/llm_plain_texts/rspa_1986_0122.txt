tldr: The authors study the nanostructure of [Ba,Cs][Ti,Al]016 hollandite series using selected-area electron diffraction and high-resolution electron microscopy. They reveal how modifications of superstructures facilitate the incorporation of caesium and describe the factors controlling tunnel site occupancies, multiplicities, and dimensionalities of hollandite superstructures. Additionally, they report structural alterations and phase transformations of hollandite under electron bombardment.
