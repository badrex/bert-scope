tldr: The authors investigate the spectra of various flames in the infra-red region, focusing on the oxy-hydrogen flame. They discover that the flame emits strong infra-red light and find that the bands observed in the flame are due to the vibration-rotation spectrum of water molecules. This research contributes to the understanding of combustion processes and molecular spectroscopy.
