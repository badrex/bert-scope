tldr: The author, E.A. Milne, presents a kinematic approach to derive the laws of dynamics and the Newtonian approximation to the law of gravitation. He introduces the concept of statistical equivalence and the cosmological principle to define the subject of study, which allows for the derivation of regularities that play the part of laws of nature. The author also discusses the semi-isolated dynamical system and the transformation of physical quantities from the kinematic scale to the dynamical scale.
