tldr: The author investigates the coefficient of expansion of a paraffine with a high boiling point and its properties when heated. They found that the paraffine undergoes a significant contraction when cooling from its liquid state to solid, and its expansion when heated is unusually high. The author also discusses the challenges in determining the coefficient of expansion due to the paraffine's low conductivity and the difficulty in achieving uniform temperature within the mass.
