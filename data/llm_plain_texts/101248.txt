tldr: In a series of experiments, Robert Boyle investigates the relationship between light and air in shining wood and fish. He discovers that the withdrawal of air from these bodies extinguishes their light, while the reintroduction of air restores it. This finding contributes to the understanding of the properties of light and the composition of air.
