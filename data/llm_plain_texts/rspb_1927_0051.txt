tldr: The authors investigated the role of mitochondria in enzymatic processes during cereal germination. They found that mitochondria are involved in both synthesis and hydrolytic degradation processes in the cell. The study provides insights into the enzymatic behavior of mitochondria and their role in plant metabolism, including the synthesis of proteins, starch, and fat.
