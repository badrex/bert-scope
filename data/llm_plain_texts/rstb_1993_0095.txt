revised_title: 'Exploring the Xylem Stream: Parasitic Organisms and their Exploitation'
semantic_tags:
  - Parasitic plants
  - Xylem feeding insects
  - Plant parasitism
  - Xylem transport
  - Plant-organism interactions
tldr: This article discusses how a diverse group of parasitic plants and insects exploit the xylem stream in angiosperms for water and nutrient acquisition. It examines their adaptations for accessing xylem tissue and the interactions between parasitic plants and their hosts, as well as the influence of host-sourced signals on the parasite. The article also explores the feeding mechanisms of xylem-feeding insects and their impact on plant productivity.
