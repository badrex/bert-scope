tldr: The author investigated the decomposition of chlorine-water by light using a voltaic balance. The study revealed two distinct periods of chemical change, with different types of reactions occurring in each period. During the first period, there is a significant loss of voltaic energy, while the second period sees a slow increase in voltaic energy. The research also showed that chlorine-water, when exposed to sunlight, behaves similarly to green plant leaves in absorbing energy.
