  - Thermodynamics
tldr: The authors study a thermodynamically closed reactor with chemical reactions involving two variables and oscillatory behavior. They explore the effects of temperature variations and self-heating on the system's dynamics, leading to complex bifurcations, period doubling, and aperiodicity (chemical chaos). The research provides insights into the behavior of non-isothermal chemical systems and their potential applications in various fields.
