tldr: This article examines the importance of cephalopods in the diets of various fish species and how their role varies depending on the habitat, depth, and size of the predator. Cephalopods are found to be more significant in the diets of larger predatory fish, such as sharks, in deeper waters, and during the spawning aggregations of squids. The study also highlights the importance of cephalopods in facilitating prey capture for secondary predators and providing rejecta to benthic scavengers.
