tldr: The cool-flame oxidation of 3-ethylpentane was studied, revealing that the reaction produces conjugate alkenes, heterocycles, and oxygenated organic products. The results suggest that two primary chain-propagating cycles may operate in the case of low molecular mass alkanes, and the decomposition of hydroperoxyalkyl radicals plays a crucial role in the reaction mechanism.
