tldr: The authors analyze the Wolf sunspot number series in the frequency domain to determine the dimension of the solar cycle system and study the stability of its main quasi-periodicities. They use various spectrum analysis methods, including Fourier harmonic, Blackman-Tukey, and maximum entropy spectrum analysis, to detect stationarity and periodicity in the sunspot data. The results show that the 11-year cycle splits before 1800, with a 55-year cycle dominant, and a single 11-year and 100-year peak after 1800. The authors suggest that working with the more invariant 22-year magnetic series can help explain the complex, non-stationary behavior of the sunspot series and solar-terrestrial interactions.
