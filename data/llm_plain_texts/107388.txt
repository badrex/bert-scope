tldr: The author, James Smithson, examines a substance called ulmin, found in elm trees, and its chemical properties. Ulmin is a combination of a red or yellow matter with potash. When exposed to acids, it forms a resin-like substance. The author also explores the differences between ulmin from Palermo and English ulmin, as well as the presence of alkali in the English variety. Additionally, he investigates the possibility of ulmin being present in the healthy sap of elm trees.
