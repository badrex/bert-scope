tldr: This study examines the mouthparts, mandibular mechanism, feeding mechanism, and proventricular functional morphology of stomatopods. It explores the differences in trophic specialization within and between the families Squillidae and Gonodactylidae, as well as the anatomy and function of the proventriculus.
