tldr: The author studied the magnetic properties of nickel-iron alloys and found that they exist in two states: non-magnetic and magnetic. The transition between these states occurs at specific temperatures, with the material becoming magnetic below freezing point and remaining so until heated to 580°C. This research sheds light on the magnetic behavior of materials like steel.
