tldr: The authors conducted experiments using a cloud chamber to study the production of positive and negative electron pairs by gamma rays. They obtained 127 pairs in 2412 exposures with argon or methyl iodide vapor and a Ra-Th source. The results showed a broad distribution of total kinetic energy for the electron pairs and provided insights into the understanding of multiple scattering and energy calculations.
