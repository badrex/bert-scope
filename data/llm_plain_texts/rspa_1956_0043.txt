tldr: This article provides a general proof of the Kelvin relations in thermo-electricity, taking into account the departure from equilibrium of both electron and lattice distribution functions. The proof demonstrates that the Kelvin relations are a direct consequence of symmetry relations and follow from the principle of microscopic reversibility. The author emphasizes the importance of treating the mutual interaction between electrons and lattice vibrations in a fully symmetrical way when formulating the theory of transport phenomena in conductors.
