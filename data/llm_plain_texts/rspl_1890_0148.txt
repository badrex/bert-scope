tldr: This article discusses the phenomenon of electrostatic screening using gratings, nets, or perforated sheets of conducting material. The author, Sir William Thomson, presents a valuable investigation of this topic and provides a helpful diagram to understand and extend the theory. The study is less rigorous when assuming the grate-bars are circular cylinders, but this assumption is not necessary for the overall understanding of the subject.
