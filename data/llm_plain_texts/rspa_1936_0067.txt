tldr: 'This study investigates the coagulation of clay suspensions and the effect of different electrolytes on their stability. The results show that the stability of the gel tends to be greater when a smaller electrolyte concentration is required to produce gelation. The authors also identify the yield point and other discontinuities in the coagulation process.'
