tldr: The article discusses the use of collisional activation mass spectrometry in organic and biological chemistry. This technique involves adding internal energy to ions in transit through a mass spectrometer, causing their unimolecular decomposition. The resulting collisional activation mass spectrum can be used for ion structure characterization, molecular structure determination, and as a separation/identification technique for complex mixtures. The article highlights various applications, advantages, and potential of collisional activation mass spectrometry, which is similar to normal electron ionization mass spectrometry.
