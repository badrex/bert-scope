tldr: The authors present a simple and accurate method for measuring the velocity constants of rapid reactions in solution by observing the maximum or minimum temperature reached during the reaction under non-adiabatic conditions. They describe a theoretical treatment for first-order and second-order reactions and demonstrate the method's effectiveness with experimental data for various reactions.
