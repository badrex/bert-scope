tldr: The authors describe a new method of crossed circulation using a heart-lung preparation to study the regulation of circulation and respiration. This method allows for precise control over blood flow and pressure, enabling researchers to investigate the factors controlling these processes. The heart-lung preparation is used to create a connection between the descending aorta of one animal and the circulation of another, allowing for the study of blood pressure changes and the effects of sensory stimuli on the animals.
