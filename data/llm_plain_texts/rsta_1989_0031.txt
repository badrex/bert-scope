tldr: This article investigates the interaction between the magnetosphere and the high-latitude ionosphere, focusing on the effects of plasma Alfvén wave relative motion. The authors use a simulation to study the dynamics of short perpendicular-scale shear Alfvén wave propagation in extended systems, providing insights into the coupling between distant regions of enhanced magnetospheric convection and the auroral ionosphere. The results help interpret recent satellite observations and contribute to the understanding of magnetosphere-ionosphere interactions.
