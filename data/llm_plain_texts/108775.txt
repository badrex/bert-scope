tldr: This article discusses the thermal effects experienced by objects moving through air. The authors, W. Thomson and J. P. Joule, conducted experiments to understand the relationship between the velocity of an object and the temperature change it experiences. They found that the thermal effect increases nearly with the square of the velocity and is influenced by factors such as air resistance and fluid friction. The authors also explored the thermal phenomena that occur when a sphere moves rapidly through air.
