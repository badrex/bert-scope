  - Refractive Index
  - Dispersion Formulae
tldr: This article compares the maxima of absorption and selective reflection for various substances, using dispersion formulae. The author determines the position of the various maxima and discusses the relationship between the maxima of absorption and selective reflection. The study includes numerical examples of iodine, carbon disulfide, rock salt, and sodium vapor, and the author provides a method to calculate the maxima for other substances.
