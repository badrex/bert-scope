tldr: This study investigates the development of eye colours in Drosophila melanogaster through pupal transplants and the influence of body fluid containing a specific substance, "v+ substance." The researchers found that the substance is produced during pupal development and can affect the eye colour of recipient pupae. The findings contribute to understanding the genetic and developmental processes in Drosophila.
