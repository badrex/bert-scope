tldr: The authors, A. Fowler and L. J. Freeman, analyze the spectrum of ionized nitrogen (N II) using condensed discharges in vacuum tubes. They identify various spectral lines and their corresponding wave numbers, providing a detailed analysis of the observed terms and their combinations. The study helps in understanding the structure of ionized nitrogen atoms and contributes to the field of atomic physics.
