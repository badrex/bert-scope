tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the electricity and light producible on the attrition of various substances, such as sealing wax, sulfur, and rosin. They discovered that the strength of the effluvia and the temperature of the air affected the amount of light and electricity produced. The author also found that the effluvia of a separate heterogeneous body could give motion to threads inside a glass globe, even without touching the glass.
