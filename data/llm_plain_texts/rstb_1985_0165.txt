revised_title: Cytochrome P450: Enzymatic Cycle and Radical Generation
semantic_tags:
  - Cytochrome P450
  - Enzymatic cycle
  - Radical generation
  - Haemproteins
  - Oxidation states
tldr: This article discusses the enzymatic cycle of cytochromes, specifically focusing on the generation of haem and substrate radicals during the process. The author explains the different oxidation states and how they contribute to the overall function of the enzyme, as well as the role of haemproteins in the reaction.
