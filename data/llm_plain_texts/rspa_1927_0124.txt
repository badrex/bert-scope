tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the emission of light from hydrogen atoms. They used a method of point excitation to determine the decay constants of different spectral lines. The results showed that the decay constants for the first three Balmer lines were fairly equal, and the method provided a way to determine both the relative and absolute values of these constants.
