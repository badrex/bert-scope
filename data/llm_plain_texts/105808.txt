tldr: Joseph Priestley conducted various experiments to study the force and obstacles of electrical explosions. He observed the effects of explosions on different materials and found that the force of an explosion is significantly diminished when the electric current has to travel through a long and complex circuit. He also discovered that the electric charge can pass through the air, but the force is weaker than when it travels through a metallic conductor.
