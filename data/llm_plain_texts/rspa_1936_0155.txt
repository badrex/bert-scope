tldr: This study investigates the acoustic properties and vibration frequencies of special steels at low temperatures. The results show that transforming nickel steels experience a significant increase in internal damping and a decrease in Young's modulus of elasticity. The findings also reveal a correlation between the steel's properties and its structure, suggesting that the acoustic method is a useful tool for studying secular changes in metals.
