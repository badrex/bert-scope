tldr: The authors designed a high-resolution mass spectrometer to study the photodissociation of organic ions in the gas phase. They used an argon-ion laser to irradiate ions and distinguished photodissociation from unimolecular dissociation by mechanically chopping the laser beam and using phase-sensitive detection. The photodissociation of nitrotoluene isomers was investigated, revealing different fragmentation pathways from unimolecular dissociations.
