tldr: Professor Owen describes and classifies four species of the extinct herbivorous mammal genus Nesodon, based on fossil remains discovered in Patagonia. He defines the dental and osteal characters of each species and proposes a new division of the Ungulata, called Toxodontia, to better understand their relationships with other mammalian orders.
