revised_title: Group Theory and Many-Body Diagrams: Enumeration of Topologically Distinct Green Diagrams

tldr: The authors extend the use of group theory to classify and enumerate topologically distinct many-particle Green diagrams, which are essential in various fields of theoretical physics. They provide explicit formulas for the number of such diagrams and develop recursion formulas to calculate the total number of graphs and connected graphs corresponding to a many-particle Green function.
