tldr: This article investigates the stability and properties of unimolecular films, focusing on the role of surface attraction. The authors examine the effects of varying surface acidity and temperature on the film's behavior, including its compressibility, cohesive forces, and equilibrium spreading pressures. Their findings contribute to a better understanding of the interactions between molecules and surfaces in colloidal systems.
