tldr: 'The author, John M\#xFC;ller, discovered four distinct hearts with regular pulsations connected to the lymphatic system in certain amphibious animals. These hearts are located under the skin and function independently of the main heart and lungs. They play a role in transporting lymph from the extremities and abdomen into the trunk of the crural veins. Similar organs were found in the toad, salamander, and green lizard, suggesting their presence in all amphibians.'
