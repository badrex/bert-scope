tldr: This study investigates the scattering of sound waves by a finite nonlinear elastic plate in a compressible fluid. The authors found that in-plane tension can result in simultaneous primary and secondary resonances, leading to two scattered fields oscillating at the acoustic forcing frequency and its multiples. This phenomenon can significantly affect the scattered sound field near resonance conditions.
