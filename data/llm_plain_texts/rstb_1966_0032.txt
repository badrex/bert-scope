tldr: This article discusses the role of ritual in human life and society, exploring how rituals help individuals confront and cope with crises, both personal and collective. Rituals are seen as responses to danger and serve to reaffirm solidarity among individuals, re-establish contact with essential principles, and provide a sense of confirmation and protection. The author argues that despite the modernization and secularization of society, rituals will continue to play a significant role in human life, as long as the need for order, meaning, and seriousness remains.
