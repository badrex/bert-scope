tldr: Edward Pigott determined the longitudes and latitudes of several notable places near the Severn River using trigonometric methods. He measured the distances between these locations and their relative positions, providing more precise geographical information than typical astronomical observations. This research improved the accuracy of mapping and surveying techniques during that time.
