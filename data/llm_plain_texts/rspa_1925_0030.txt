tldr: The author studied the behavior of the thallium line 5350 in arc spectra and discovered that it changes from a doublet to a triplet and back as the amount of material in the arc decreases. The complex behavior is explained by the self-reversal of the line components, which is a phenomenon where the line becomes broader and eventually overlaps, creating a seemingly tripled line.
