revised_title: 'Correction to Electromagnetic Wave Scattering by Assemblies of Particles in the Rayleigh Approximation'
semantic_tags:

  - Error correction
tldr: The author identified an error in their previous paper on electromagnetic wave scattering by assemblies of particles in the Rayleigh approximation. They found that the error was due to a mistake in the computer program's orientation angle calculation. The corrected paper confirms that the reciprocity theorem is satisfied for random orientation, and the scattering and absorption efficiencies remain unaffected.
