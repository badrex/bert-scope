tldr: The authors conducted experiments with diphtheria toxin and antitoxin to understand the nature of their interaction. They found that the toxin and antitoxin react chemically, and this reaction can be separated using a gelatin filter. This discovery challenges previous theories that the interaction between toxins and antitoxins is indirect and occurs through the intervention of cells in the body.
