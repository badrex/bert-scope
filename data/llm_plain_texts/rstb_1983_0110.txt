tldr: 'Plants perceive shade by responding to changes in the fluence rate and spectral quality of natural light. They use separate photoreceptors absorbing in blue and red wavebands, with phytochrome playing a role in detecting specific shade caused by surrounding vegetation. The study focuses on signal-transducing photoreceptors that help plants react to shade, comparing the spectral properties of natural light with the properties of these photoreceptors.'
