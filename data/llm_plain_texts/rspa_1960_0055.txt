tldr: The authors studied the crystal structure, thermal expansion, and molecular vibrations of di-para-xylene at different temperatures. They used X-ray diffraction to analyze the atomic positions and calculated the Debye factors for different atoms. The results showed that the molecule has considerable interbenzenoid orbital overlapping and large internal vibrations. The molecular geometry and vibration patterns were found to be consistent with physical and chemical probabilities.
