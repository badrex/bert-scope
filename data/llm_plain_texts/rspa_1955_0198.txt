tldr: This article introduces the concept of regenerative stochastic processes and demonstrates how they can be used to analyze a wide range of stochastic processes, including Markov chains and queueing systems. The authors show that under general conditions, the instantaneous probability distribution of a regenerative process will eventually converge to a unique limiting distribution, regardless of the initial conditions. They also prove a multi-dimensional central limit theorem for regenerative processes, which has important implications for the analysis of complex systems.
