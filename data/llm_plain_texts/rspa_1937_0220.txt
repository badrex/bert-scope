tldr: The authors conducted thermal conductivity experiments on various mica samples up to 600°C, discovering that while muscovite varieties showed little change, phlogopite micas experienced a significant decrease in thermal conductivity around 200°C. X-ray analysis revealed structural changes in the micas at the same temperature, indicating a connection between the crystal structure and thermal conductivity.
