tldr: The author demonstrates the stability of solitary-wave solutions of the Korteweg-de Vries equation, which models long water waves and other systems. The study uses principles from functional analysis and spectral theory to estimate invariants associated with the equation, providing a rigorous foundation for understanding the stability of these waves.
