tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the conductive powers of various substances and their influence on the problem of terrestrial temperature. They discovered that factors such as pressure, discontinuity, temperature, and moisture affect the conductivity of materials. The author also found that the approximate law of radiation is generally true for substances like mercury, but the increase in radiation is smaller than predicted by the law of DULONG and PETIT.
