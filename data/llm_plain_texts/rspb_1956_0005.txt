tldr: The authors studied the luminescent responses of sea pens, specifically Leioptilus gurneyi, and found that the light emitted by the polyps is controlled by a non-polarized nerve net. Gentle mechanical or electrical stimulation causes luminescent waves to travel along the rachis, and the authors analyzed the temporal characteristics of these responses. They also discovered that light exposure can temporarily inhibit luminescence in these sea pens.
