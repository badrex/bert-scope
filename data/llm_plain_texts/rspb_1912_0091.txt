tldr: The authors conducted a study on the size of the aorta in warm-blooded animals and found that the aortic radius increases more slowly than the animal's body weight. They discovered that the sectional area of the aorta is proportional to the blood volume of the individual and can be calculated using a formula that relates body weight, surface area, and a constant specific to each species. This research helps in understanding the relationship between aortic size, body weight, and surface area in warm-blooded animals.
