tldr: This article investigates the effects of alloying on the distortion and shear stress of crystals. It compares the results of experiments on zinc-cadmium and aluminum-zinc alloys, finding that the presence of zinc affects the slip-planes differently in each alloy. The study suggests that there are other factors involved in the formation of alloys that contribute to their unique properties.
