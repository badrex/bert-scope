tldr: The author conducted experiments on the elastic properties and plastic extension of metals using an Optical Recorder of Load and Elastic Extension. They discovered that when metals are stretched beyond their limit of proportionality, they lose their power of proportional extension and perfect recovery after removing the load. This behavior is called unproportional elasticity, and it can be observed through looping patterns in the load-extension diagrams.
