tldr: The article investigates the convective regime in thermally driven tall cavity flows within porous media. It focuses on the structure of the solution in the limit of large Darcy-Rayleigh numbers, leading to a non-parallel convective flow in the cavity. The study provides insights into the flow patterns, heat transfer predictions, and boundary layer structures in these systems.
