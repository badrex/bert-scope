tldr: The author discusses a book that challenges the idea of univocal generation for insects and presents an experiment observing snail reproduction. The author found clusters of tiny eggs that eventually hatched into snails, providing evidence against the univocal generation theory. This discovery refutes the arguments of Father Philippo Bonani, a Jesuit, who doubted the egg-based reproduction of snails and tried to disprove the experiments of Signor Redi.
