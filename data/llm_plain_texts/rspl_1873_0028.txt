tldr: The authors, William Shanks and Rev. George Salmon, present a method for calculating the number of figures in the period of the reciprocal of every prime number below 20,000. They also correct errors in existing tables by Burckhardt and Desmarest. This work contributes to the understanding of prime numbers and primitive roots.
