tldr: The author investigates the effects of vagus nerve stimulation on the rhythm and force of contractions in frog hearts. They discovered that vagus nerve stimulation can cause varying effects on the heart, from complete standstill to a simple primary augmentation of contractions. The author also found that the vagus nerve's action on the heart is influenced by the heart's nutrition and the condition of the ventricular muscle.
