tldr: The authors developed a new method to study ionising potentials by using mercury as the primary substance due to its high molecular weight and ease of producing a unidirectional molecular stream. They introduced mercury vapour into an ionisation tube and used a combination of electric fields and positive ray analysis to study the ionisation process and the nature of the ions formed. This method provided more complete information about ionisation and atomic structure.
