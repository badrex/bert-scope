revised_title: 'The Effect of Different Electric Constants on the Intensity of Radiation from a Source'
semantic_tags:

tldr: The author investigates the effect of varying electric constants in the vicinity of a source of electric waves and at a distance from it. They find that the intensity of radiation remains practically unaffected by differences in electric constants in the atmosphere at a distance from the Earth's surface, which is relevant to wireless telegraphy.
