tldr: This article discusses the use of zone correction plates and other techniques for structure determination of aperiodic objects at atomic resolution using a conventional electron microscope. It also addresses the challenges of radiation damage and potential solutions, such as working at low temperatures or introducing heavy atoms as electron-donors for staining.
