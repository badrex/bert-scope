tldr: The article is a biographical memoir of Sir Harold Jeffreys, a pioneer in the physical study of the Earth and applied mathematics. Jeffreys contributed significantly to understanding the Earth's interior, developing a theory of probability on Bayesian principles, and applying classical mechanics to investigate the Earth's core and the differences between the upper and lower mantle. His work in seismology, fluid dynamics, and dynamical meteorology laid the foundation for future research in these fields.
