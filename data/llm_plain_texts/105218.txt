tldr: 'The author, Stephen Hales, conducted experiments to determine the effectiveness of lime-water in preserving water and fish. He found that stone-lime, as opposed to chalk-lime, can preserve water from putrefaction and keep fish sweet for an extended period. Lime-water made from chalk-lime, however, has minimal antiseptic properties. The author also discusses the difference in preservation between fish and meat.'
