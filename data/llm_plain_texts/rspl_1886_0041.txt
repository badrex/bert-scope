tldr: This article discusses the luni-solar variations of magnetic declination and horizontal force at Bombay and declination at Trevandrum. The author, Charles Chambers, presents a hypothesis that these variations are combinations of solar diurnal variations that run through a cycle of change in a lunation. The study finds that the variations of declination and horizontal force are related to each other in a definite manner, with the winter season showing similar variations at different ages of the moon. The hypothesis holds true for magnetic variations at Trevandrum as well.
