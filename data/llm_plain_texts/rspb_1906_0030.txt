tldr: The authors developed a method to accurately detect and estimate small quantities of nickel in animal tissue and organic substances. The method involves three stages: ashing, separating, and estimating. The colorimetric analysis using a-dimethylglyoxime reagent allows for sharper results and can detect nickel in quantities as small as 1/1000 milligramme. This method is useful for toxicology and biochemical research.
