tldr: This study investigates the failure mechanisms of short anchor bolts embedded in brittle materials, focusing on the pull-out test. A linear elastic fracture mechanics model is used to predict crack paths, determine crack growth stability, and estimate the tensile capacity of the anchor bolts. The findings provide a better understanding of the failure mechanisms and help improve design procedures for anchor bolts in concrete structures.
