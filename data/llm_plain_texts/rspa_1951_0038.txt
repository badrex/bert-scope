tldr: This article presents an experimental study of the exchange of charge between ions and atoms. The authors measured charge-exchange cross-sections for ions with neutral atoms, focusing on the unsymmetrical process and its behavior with varying energy levels. The research aims to improve our understanding of the rate-determining factors in inelastic atomic collision processes and their significance in physical phenomena, such as ion mobility and ion sources and accelerators. The findings contribute to the development of modern quantum theory and its applications in atomic physics.
