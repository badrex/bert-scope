tldr: The author investigates the intertraction phenomenon, where two fluids mix and move into each other, and explores its relationship with surface tension. They find that intertraction occurs independently of factors such as molecule size, hydration water, and electrolytes. The phenomenon is closely related to surface tension forces, as evidenced by experiments with varying surface tension depressors and the accurate prediction of intertraction by Clerk Maxwell.
