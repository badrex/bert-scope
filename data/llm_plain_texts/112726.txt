tldr: The author investigates the reaction of bromine with ethylbenzol and discovers that the presence or absence of iodine determines the position of the substituting bromine atom. When bromine is free from iodine, substitution occurs in the lateral group, while the presence of iodine causes substitution in the phenyl group. This finding expands our understanding of substitution reactions and the role of iodine in organic chemistry.
