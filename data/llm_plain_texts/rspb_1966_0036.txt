tldr: This article discusses the results of selection experiments in plant and animal populations, focusing on the effectiveness of selection in producing improvement and the information these experiments provide about the architecture of genetic variation in different characters. The author highlights various selection experiments in poultry, pigs, and plants, and the potential for genetic improvement in domestic animals and plants. The article also addresses the challenges and obstacles in applying genetic knowledge to animal improvement and the changing direction of selection pressure.
