tldr: The authors studied the current drawn from a flame ionization detector and analyzed the ionization process in flames. They found that the detector response is linear over a wide concentration range and is related to the number of carbon atoms in the molecule. The theory of chemi-ionization, in which the energy required for ionization comes from chemical processes in the flame, is considered the main process of ion formation. The flame ionization detector is widely used in gas chromatography, and this study provides insights into its functioning and ionization processes.
