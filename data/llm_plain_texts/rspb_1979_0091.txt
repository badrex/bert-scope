tldr: The authors analyze a simple model of an epithelial transport system to understand the behavior of transporting epithelial cells. They find that the model, which includes essential ion transport asymmetries, predicts much of the observed behavior of tight-type epithelia under various experimental conditions. This analysis provides new insights and a more quantitative framework for testing hypotheses about epithelial transport.
