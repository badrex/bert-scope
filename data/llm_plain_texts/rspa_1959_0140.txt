tldr: The authors study the operation of Langmuir probes in electro-negative plasmas and derive a criterion for the positive-ion energy distribution at the edge of a sheath surrounding a negative probe. They find that the potential falls to low values when the ratio of negative ions to electrons exceeds 2. The authors also explore the potential distribution and ion currents in the region outside a positive ion sheath for various negative-ion to electron ratios.
