tldr: The author, John Templer, conducted experiments on glow-worms to understand their shining and movement patterns. He discovered that glow-worms only shine when in motion and that their light is affected by water. Templer also observed that after being pricked, the glow-worm's light and movement changed, and it lay on its back for several days. He sought more information on how to determine if a glow-worm is dead and hoped for more opportunities to study these insects.
