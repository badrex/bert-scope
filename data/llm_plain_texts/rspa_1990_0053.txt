tldr: The authors studied electron diffraction patterns from materials containing planar boundaries, specifically intergrowth tungsten bronzes, to understand their structures. They used Fourier-transform calculations and optical-diffraction analogues to analyze the diffraction patterns and compared them with experimental transmission electron microscopy results. This approach allowed them to deduce the arrangement of boundaries in these complex phases without the need for high-resolution imaging.
