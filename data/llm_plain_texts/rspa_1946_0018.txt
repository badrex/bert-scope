tldr: The authors derive the equations of motion for point particles interacting with a generalized wave field of arbitrary integral spin. They show that the equations contain only a few terms in the inflow and demonstrate a method for calculating the radiation field. The authors also introduce the concept of particle spin and its constancy, which simplifies the equations of motion for charged dipoles in vector and scalar-meson fields.
