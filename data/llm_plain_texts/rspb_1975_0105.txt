tldr: This study compares the respiratory responses of the bivalves Arctica islandica and Mytilus edulis to declining oxygen tension. Arctica increases its ventilation rate down to a low oxygen level of about 7 kPa, while Mytilus shows a slight initial increase in ventilation rate, which then falls steadily as oxygen levels decline. The different respiratory responses may be due to the different patterns of pumping behavior related to their habitats and the relative energy costs of pumping blood and water.
