tldr: This article discusses the atomic weight of glucinum or beryllium and examines the impact of impurities on specific heat measurements. The author compares different experiments and suggests that further research is needed with a more pure and homogeneous form of beryllium to determine its atomic weight accurately. The author also debates the classification of beryllium within the periodic table.
