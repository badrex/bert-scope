tldr: The authors conducted a perturbation analysis of the Bell-Szekeres space-time, focusing on the region where the scattering of colliding plane-fronted waves occurs and the regions prior to the instant of collision. They found a complete set of normal modes expressed in terms of spin-weighted spherical harmonics, which exhibit increasing frequency as the horizon is approached. This analysis raises conceptual questions about the stability of space-time solutions and the development of horizons.
