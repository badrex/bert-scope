tldr: This study investigates the noradrenaline content of the vas deferens in guinea pigs and its response to various stimulation methods. The authors found that the noradrenaline content of the vas deferens is less susceptible to change compared to the cat's spleen. They also discovered that neither stimulation nor decentralization of the adrenergic innervation of the vas deferens produces any significant alteration in the noradrenaline content.
