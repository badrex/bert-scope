tldr: During the total solar eclipse of April 16, 1893, J. Norman Lockyer and his team used a prismatic camera to capture photographs of the sun's corona and prominences. The photographs revealed the H and K lines of calcium, hydrogen lines, and other spectral lines. The prismatic camera provided clearer images of the solar atmosphere than previous instruments, offering valuable insights into the nature of the corona and prominences.
