tldr: The authors conducted a kinetic investigation of the photochemical oxidation of certain non-conjugated olefins, finding that the process occurs through a chain-reaction mechanism involving the photolytic generation of free radicals. The dominant initiation process is the photolysis of the olefin hydroperoxide, and the reaction rate is influenced by factors such as light absorption and oxygen pressure. The study provides insights into the underlying mechanisms and kinetics of olefin oxidation.
