tldr: W. D. Haggard conducted experiments on a piece of Pena silver, salvaged from the wrecked Lady Charlotte, to determine its water-holding capacity. The silver, a unique form of silver collected with quicksilver, has a porous structure resembling dry mortar. Haggard found that the Pena silver could absorb a significant amount of water, which could be useful in various applications.
