tldr: The authors study the energy and helicity of knotted magnetic flux tubes in magnetostatic equilibrium. They introduce a local non-orthogonal coordinate system and decompose the magnetic field into toroidal and poloidal components. The helicity of the field is determined, and new results are obtained for kink mode instability and associated bifurcations. The technique is applicable to any knot admitting a parametric representation, and the findings have implications for understanding magnetic structures in astrophysics.
