tldr: In a letter to Thomas Birch, David Erskine Baker describes the earthquake that occurred in York on April 19, 1754. He provides details about the shock's intensity, duration, and the direction of its course. The earthquake was also felt in nearby towns such as Foforth, Bishopthorpe, Huntington, Hesslington, and Selby. The author mentions that if Mr. Birch thinks the account is worth sharing with the Royal Society, he is free to do so.
