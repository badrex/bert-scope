tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the effectiveness of Colchicum Autumnale in treating gout. They found that the medicine acts through the circulation and not directly on the stomach and intestinal canal. The study also showed that the deposit in the medicine is not necessary for its effectiveness, and it may cause more harm than good when taken along with the infusion.
