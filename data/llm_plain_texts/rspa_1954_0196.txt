tldr: The authors conducted experiments on turbulent convection in a fluid between horizontal surfaces. They observed six discrete transitions in the slope of the heat-transport curve between Rayleigh numbers of 1700 and 1000000. These transitions appear to agree with those deduced on an assumption of a constant thermal gradient. The study provides insights into the behavior of turbulent convection and its potential applications in understanding and classifying various phenomena related to fluid dynamics.
