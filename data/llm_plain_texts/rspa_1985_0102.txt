tldr: The authors investigated the hydrogen bonding interactions in the gas phase by studying the rotational spectrum of the hydrogen-bonded heterodimer HCN-HF. They determined the molecular geometry, hydrogen bond stretching force constant, and internal dynamics of the subunits. The results showed that the H-F bond lengthens by 0.14 Ã… when the heterodimer is formed.
