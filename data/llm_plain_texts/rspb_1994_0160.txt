tldr: The study investigates the dual function of the bushcricket spermatophore, which serves both to protect the male's ejaculate during insemination and enhance female fecundity and offspring fitness. The research finds that larger spermatophores are associated with increased female fecundity and require longer regeneration times for males, suggesting that there is a trade-off between the two functions of nuptial gifts.
