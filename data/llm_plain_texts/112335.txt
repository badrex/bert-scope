tldr: Lionel S. Beale investigates the connection between nerve fibers and voluntary muscle using tree frog specimens. He demonstrates that fine nerve fibers can be traced throughout the muscle, contradicting previous theories that they end within the muscle. This research contributes to the understanding of muscle and nerve interactions.
