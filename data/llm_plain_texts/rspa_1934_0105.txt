tldr: The authors developed a technique for electrometrically titrating amino-acids in aqueous-alcoholic solutions, which supported the zwitterionic theory of their constitution. The method provided insights into the behavior of acidic and basic groups in relation to the solvent's dielectric constant and helped interpret dissociation constants.
