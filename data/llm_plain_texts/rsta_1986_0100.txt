tldr: The author surveys tetrahedral structures in crystal chemistry, focusing on structures built from regular tetrahedral groups. The study covers various types of structures, including finite, one-dimensional, two-dimensional, and three-dimensional structures, and discusses their classifications based on coordination numbers and topological features. The research provides insights into the construction and properties of tetrahedral structures and their importance in crystal chemistry.
