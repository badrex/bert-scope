tldr: The authors discovered two immune peptides, defensins A and B, in the mosquito Aedes aegypti that are induced in response to infection. Both peptides display biological activity against Gram-positive microbes and have substantial sequence homology to insect defensins from other insects. Defensin B is the most abundant antibacterial peptide in this species, while defensin A is less abundant and has two amino acid substitutions, making it more basic in character.
