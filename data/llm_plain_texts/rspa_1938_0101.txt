tldr: The authors conducted experiments using counters to determine the range-distribution curve of radioactive alpha-particles from 8Li. They found that 8Li emits alpha-particles with a continuous range of energies from 1.2 x 10^6 eV (0.65 cm) to 5.5 cm. The mass of 8Li was estimated to be between 8.0246 and 8.0252, providing insights into the energy balance in the radioactive disintegration process.
