tldr: This paper presents a precise determination of the electromotive force of the Weston normal cell using a modified form of the bifilar Weber electro-dynamometer. The authors improved the accuracy of the value of the cell's electromotive force by overcoming previous obstacles in using the electro-dynamometer. The final value for the electromotive force of the international mean Weston normal cell is found to be 1.01831 semi-absolute volts at 20Â°C.
