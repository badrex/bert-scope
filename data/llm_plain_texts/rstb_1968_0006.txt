tldr: 'This study investigates the habitat and area effects on the polymorphism of the snail species Cepaea nemoralis and C. hortensis. The authors found that both species show morph frequency variation with habitat and area effects, with the most cryptic morphs being more common in specific habitats. The variation in morph frequencies is best explained by visual selection, and area effects are mainly observed in upland localities. The research supports the idea that these effects are maintained by selection.'
