tldr: 'This article extends the Smith-Stone theory of fish propulsion by incorporating the wake effect. The authors use a flexible plate model to simulate fish motion in a two-dimensional flow field and solve the Laplace equation in an elliptic cylindrical coordinate system. The results are shown to be identical to those derived by Siekmann, and a simple example is provided for illustration, with predicted results compared to experimental data.'
