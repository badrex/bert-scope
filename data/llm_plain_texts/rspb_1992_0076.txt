tldr: The article investigates the parallel reflex and central control of promotor and receptor motorneurons in crayfish. It demonstrates that an identified receptor motorneuron is coactivated with promotor motorneurons and influenced by reflex from the tcmro and tcco, similar to a particular subgroup of promotor motorneuron. This complex control could regulate reflex gain throughout the step cycle during walking in the intact animal.
