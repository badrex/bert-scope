tldr: This article presents a new approximate method for analyzing the stability of viscous flow in a curved channel. The method uses orthogonal functions to represent the flow and provides a simpler solution than previous methods. The results show that instability first sets in when a parameter reaches a value of about 36, in agreement with earlier findings. The study also reveals a marked asymmetry in the cellular pattern of motion that occurs at the onset of instability.
