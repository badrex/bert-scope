tldr: The author explores the possibility of nuclear fission as an energy source for planetary and protostellar systems, including the giant outer planets and protostars. They suggest that nuclear fission energy could ignite thermonuclear fusion reactions in stars and may account for dark matter in the universe by considering the presence of dark stars whose protostellar nuclear fission reactors failed to ignite thermonuclear fusion reactions.
