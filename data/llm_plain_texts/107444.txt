  - Potassium compounds
  - Barium compounds
tldr: The author conducted experiments on iodine compounds, specifically the triple and double compounds of potassium and other elements. They discovered various chemical reactions and properties of these compounds, such as their solubility in different acids and their decomposition when heated. The author also proposed naming the triple compounds "oxy-iodes" based on their composition and properties.
