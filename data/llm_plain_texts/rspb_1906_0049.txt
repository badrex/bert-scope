tldr: The author examines the life-history of leucocytes, studying their cell division and cytology in bone marrow, lymphatic glands, and spleen. They observe different types of cell division, including amitosis and mitosis, and discuss the similarities between leucocyte development and the production of sexual elements in animals and plants. The study provides insights into the complex processes of cell division and the role of leucocytes in the immune system.
