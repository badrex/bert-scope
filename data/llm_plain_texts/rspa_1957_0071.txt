revised_title: Mutual Friction in Heat Currents in Liquid Helium II: Experiments on Steady Heat Currents
semantic_tags:
  - Superfluidity

  - Mutual friction
  - Second sound
  - Two-fluid model
tldr: This article presents experiments on the conduction of heat through liquid helium II in wide channels, focusing on the properties of the mutual friction force in the two-fluid model. The authors measure the force of mutual friction in a heat current and study its effects on second sound, providing insights into the behavior of superfluid helium and the underlying mechanisms of mutual friction.
