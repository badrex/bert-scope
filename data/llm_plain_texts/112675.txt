tldr: This article by Prof. Cayley discusses the theory of curves that satisfy given conditions. It covers the study of curves of a determinate order and conics, with a focus on contact geometry. The author also mentions the research of Chasles, Zeuthen, De Jonquieres, and Salmon, and plans to publish a separate memoir on the application of the Principle of Correspondence.
