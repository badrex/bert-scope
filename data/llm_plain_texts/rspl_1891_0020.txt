tldr: The author investigates the effects of caustic alkali on phyllocyanin and phylloxanthin, substances derived from chlorophyll through the action of acids. They also describe the transformation of chlorophyll under the influence of alkalis, resulting in a new compound called alkachlorophyll. Additionally, the study explores the physiological effects of these substances on the respiratory rhythm and ventricular function.
