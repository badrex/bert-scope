tldr: This article discusses the results of three-dimensional fluid dynamic numerical experiments on the gravitational fragmentation of Jeans unstable gas clouds during dynamic collapse. The experiments show that fragmentation and the formation of smaller fragments are directly related to the number of Jeans masses in the initial cloud. The findings have important implications for star formation in the early Universe and the formation of supermassive stars.
