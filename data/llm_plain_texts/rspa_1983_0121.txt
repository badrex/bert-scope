tldr: This article explores rectilinear diffraction, a type of diffraction where waves proceed essentially in a straight line, in dispersive conservative wave systems. The author derives a linear Schrodinger equation with constant potential to describe rectilinear diffraction and discusses its applications and implications. The study covers both steady and unsteady cases and provides insights into the behavior of waves in various scenarios, including deep water waves and conical waves.
