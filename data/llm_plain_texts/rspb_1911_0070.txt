tldr: The authors studied the role of hormones in osmotic effects and nutrient transport in plants. They discovered that certain substances, called hormones, can affect the permeability of plant cells' outer differential septa. These hormones control the passage of nutrients and other materials within the plant. The authors also found that hydrogen cyanide has a unique effect on plant cells, which may help explain how plants transport nutrients and regulate metabolism.
