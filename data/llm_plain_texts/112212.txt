tldr: The author examines the distribution of nerves in striped muscle fibers, specifically in frogs, and challenges previous theories about the termination of nerves in muscles. They found that nerves form extensive networks and circuits throughout the length of muscle fibers, and that these networks are composed of very fine fibers. The author also discovered that the so-called connective tissue corpuscles near the sarcolemma are actually nuclei of very fine nerve fibers.
