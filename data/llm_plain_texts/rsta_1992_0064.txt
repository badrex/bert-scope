tldr: This article describes time-resolved crystallography studies on glycogen phosphorylase, an enzyme that plays a crucial role in breaking down glycogen to glucose-1-phosphate. The researchers used a caged phosphate compound to initiate the reaction in the crystal and recorded diffraction data before and after the reaction. The results provide insights into the enzyme's catalytic mechanism and help understand how it promotes the phosphorolysis of glycogen.
