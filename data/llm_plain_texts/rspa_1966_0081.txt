tldr: The authors evaluate radiative corrections of order Rydbergs for the ionization energy of the metastable states of the helium atom. They find that the main contribution comes from the transition to and states. By using six-parameter wavefunctions for the metastable states and a product of a hydrogenic wavefunction with for the electron and a wavefunction analogous to the Hartree wavefunction for the excited electron, they calculate the average excitation energies for the singlet and triplet states. The Lamb shift corrections, including the estimate of Ry order corrections, are then added to the ionization energies, resulting in a more accurate estimation of the ionization potentials.
