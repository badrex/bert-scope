tldr: The study investigates the properties of blue astaxanthin-proteins found in the surface-dwelling oceanic organism Velella velella. The proteins are separated into four main fractions and their molecular sizes are estimated. The pigments have specific anion-binding sites that influence their visible and circular dichroism spectra, as well as their quaternary structure. The research also explores the specificity of carotenoid attachment to the apoprotein and the factors that contribute to the protein's dimerization and further polymerization.
