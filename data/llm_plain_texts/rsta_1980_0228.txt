tldr: The authors discuss the connection between large-scale solar magnetic fields, coronal holes, and high-speed solar wind streams. They explain that coronal holes, regions of open magnetic fields with low particle densities, are the sources of high-speed solar wind streams. This connection has important implications for our understanding of the solar wind's formation and the solar-terrestrial relationship.
