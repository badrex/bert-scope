tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the action of lipase, an enzyme that breaks down fats. They discovered that lipase selectively hydrolyzes ethereal salts of higher fatty acids, and they proposed a hypothesis that the hydrolysis of these salts by lipase involves the direct association of the enzyme with the carboxyl center, which can be prevented by the "hydration" of this center. This research sheds light on the understanding of enzyme action and the selective power of lipase.
