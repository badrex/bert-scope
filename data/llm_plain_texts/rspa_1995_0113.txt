revised_title: 'Errata and Corrections in Monodromic Systems on Affine Flag Manifolds'
semantic_tags:

tldr: This article provides corrections and errata for a previous publication on monodromic systems on affine flag manifolds. It addresses errors in the original text, including incorrect equations and references, and offers corrected versions of the affected sections. The article also presents a new upper bound for the auxiliary function in a related model of diffusive crack initiation.
