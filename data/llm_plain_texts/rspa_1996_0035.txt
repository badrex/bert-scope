tldr: The authors used incoherent quasi-elastic neutron scattering (IQNS) spectroscopy to study the dynamic properties of solid tetrakis(trimethylsilyl)silane (TTMSS) and found three distinct dynamic regimes with changes in behavior at 120 and 240 K. They concluded that the isotropic reorientational diffusion is slower than the three-fold jumps of the group about the bond in the high-temperature phase.
