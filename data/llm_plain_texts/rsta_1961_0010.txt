tldr: The authors analyzed the absorption spectrum of octadeuteronaphthalene near 3200 Å and found a nearly complete similarity to naphthalene h-8, with differences in the relative ability of non-totally symmetrical vibrations to induce absorption along the shorter in-plane molecular axis. The study provides insights into the molecular structure and vibrational modes of naphthalene and its isotopic variants.
