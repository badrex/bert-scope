tldr: The author describes the discovery of glands in the dura mater, which are responsible for producing and distributing a special humor to keep the brain's membranes and surfaces from drying out. These glands, called "conglobate glands," are found in the longitudinal sinus and play a crucial role in maintaining the health of the brain.
