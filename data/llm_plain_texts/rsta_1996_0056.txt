tldr: The article discusses the impact of pressure-induced phase transitions in the Earth's mantle on convective mixing and circulation. The author analyzes the influence of the olivine-spinel and spinel-perovskite phase transformations on the Clapeyron slope and the resulting layering of the flow. The study suggests that these phase transitions can reconcile the discrepancies in the estimates of mantle viscosity and provide insights into the Earth's deep interior.
