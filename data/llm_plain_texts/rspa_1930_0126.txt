tldr: The authors investigate the triboelectric effects and surface strain in unlike solids, such as ebonite and various metals, by rubbing them together. They find that the charges generated are due to differential strain on the surfaces caused by rubbing. The research also explores the role of organic films in triboelectricity and friction, and the relaxation temperatures for surface strain in copper and iron.
