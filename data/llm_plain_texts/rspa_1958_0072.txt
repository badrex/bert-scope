tldr: This article explores the development of collective motion in the nuclear shell model using group-theoretical methods to investigate classification schemes for nucleons in mixed configurations. The author focuses on a particular coupling scheme associated with the degeneracy of a harmonic oscillator potential, which has collective properties and is similar to shell-model calculations with configurational mixing. The study aims to understand how collective properties, such as rotational properties, can emerge from shell-model calculations with limited configuration mixing.
