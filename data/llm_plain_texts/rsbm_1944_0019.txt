tldr: 'James Reid Moir was a self-taught archaeologist who discovered evidence of prehistoric human presence in East Anglia. He challenged the beliefs of his time and proved that humans were present before the ancient Crag deposits were laid down. Moir's dedication to research and his discoveries humanized the Crag deposits, making them significant pages in human history.'
