tldr: The authors study the polarization and angular distribution of atomic line radiation excited by electron impact. They develop a theory based on calculating the probability of a polarized photon being emitted by the atom-electron system and compare their theoretical predictions with experimental results. The authors find that the polarization observed in some cases cannot be explained by the reactions considered, and further experimental work is recommended.
