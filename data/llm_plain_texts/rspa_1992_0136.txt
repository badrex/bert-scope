tldr: The authors derive necessary conditions for a second-order covariant differential operator to be a symmetry operator of Maxwell's equations in a general curved space-time background. They find that such operators are naturally formulated in terms of conformal Killing vectors, tensors, and spinors. These operators play a role in the solution of Maxwell's equations via separation of variables in the Kerr background space-time.
