tldr: The author, James Farquharson, conducted a geometrical measurement to determine the height of the Aurora Borealis above the Earth. He found that the vertical extension of the fringe of streamers was 3212 feet, with the lower edge of the arch only 1500 feet above the summit of the Corean hills.
