tldr: This study investigates the effects of increased barometric pressure on the human body, specifically the possibility of oxygen bubbles being set free in the body. The authors found that when the body is exposed to high oxygen levels, oxygen bubbles can form in the tissues and cause convulsions. These bubbles can be dangerous and may lead to embolism if the tissues cannot combine with the oxygen. The authors suggest that slow decompression is the safest method to avoid these risks.
