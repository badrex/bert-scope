tldr: The author examines the osteology of the hyopotamidé, an extinct family of ungulates with a wide distribution and diverse forms. They argue that the Anoplotherium, previously considered the most ancient form of the Paridigitata, is actually a reduced branch with no direct connection to living Paridigitata. Instead, the true lineage of Ruminantia should be traced through other early Eocene genera. The author also highlights the richness and variety of the Hyopotamidé family, which had crescentic teeth with five well-developed lobes on their upper molars.
