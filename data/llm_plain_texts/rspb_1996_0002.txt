tldr: The study investigates the effects of mite nest ectoparasites on the growth of male and female pied flycatchers. The results show that fledgling sex is a significant factor in modulating the effects of nest ectoparasites on nestling skeletal growth, with males suffering more detrimental effects than females. This finding suggests that parasites may interact with host hormones and the immune system to cause sexual size dimorphisms in young animals.
