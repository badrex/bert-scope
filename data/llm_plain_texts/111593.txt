tldr: This article presents experiments conducted by William Fairbairn and T. Tate on the resistance and strength of glass globes and cylinders when subjected to external and internal pressures. They found that the resistance to collapse and bursting varies depending on the type of glass and the method of testing. The authors also derived formulas to express the relationship between the bursting pressure, thickness, and diameter of the glass globes and the collapsing pressure of cylindrical vessels.
