tldr: 'This study investigates the visual acuity and image formation in the compound eyes of three insect species. The researchers found that the minimum angular separation needed to evoke a threshold response was higher than previous behavioral experiments. They discovered that multiple images are formed in the eyes, with the first image being a simple geometrical one, followed by deeper diffraction images. The diffraction images provide higher resolution and are sensitive to the orientation of striped patterns, showing a preference for objects of radial symmetry.'
