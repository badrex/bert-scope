tldr: A pin was found in the gizzard of a fowl, and the author examines the pin's position and how it affected the bird's digestive system. The pin had passed through the stomach membranes and formed a callus, but the bird was still able to thrive. The author leaves it to the reader to determine how the pin could pass through the membranes without obstructing the bird's digestion.
