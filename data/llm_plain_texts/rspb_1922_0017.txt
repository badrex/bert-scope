tldr: The author examines the depressor nerve in rabbits, studying its origin, course, and structure. They find that the nerve varies in its mode of origin and contains both myelinated and non-myelinated fibers. The depressor nerve is connected to a special collection of ganglion cells in the vagus nerve, which may give rise to afferent fibers. The nerve's function is likely not solely afferent, as it contains fine myelinated and non-myelinated fibers similar to those in the autonomic nervous system, suggesting efferent activity.
