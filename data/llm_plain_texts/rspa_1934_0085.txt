tldr: 'The authors developed a method to examine the optical constants of thin mercury films. They constructed a chamber to prepare and maintain clean, dry nitrogen environments for the mercury surfaces. By measuring the reflection and transmission of light through the films, they determined the optical properties and surface characteristics of the mercury. The study provided valuable insights into the behavior of inhomogeneous surfaces and the potential applications of thin films in various fields.'
