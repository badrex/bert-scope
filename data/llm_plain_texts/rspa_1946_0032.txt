tldr: The author discusses the structure, function, and synthesis of polysaccharides, focusing on cellulose, starch, and glycogen. They describe the molecular structure of cellulose and how it is derived from cellobiose. They also explore the two components of starch, amylose and amylopectin, and their properties. The author explains the enzyme systems involved in the synthesis and breakdown of these polysaccharides, including the role of phosphorylases in their formation.
