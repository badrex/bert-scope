tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments on dog hearts to study the origin and propagation of the excitatory process in the auricles. They used electrical methods and electrocardiography to analyze the contraction waves in the heart. The findings provide insights into the complex electrical and mechanical interactions within the heart, which is essential for understanding cardiac function and potential treatments for heart-related issues.'
