tldr: 'J. Smeaton observed the solar eclipse of June 4, 1769, at the Austhorpe Observatory near Leeds. Using an advanced telescope, he measured the duration of the eclipse and the part of the Sun's diameter remaining uneclipsed. Smeaton also noticed two protuberant parts on the Moon's circumference, which he believed were caused by mountains on the lunar surface.'
