tldr: The author discusses the role of bile in the animal body and its effects on the intestines. They argue that a stimulus on the outside of the intestines cannot cause the contraction and distension observed in certain cases, as the nerves in the intestinal walls are insensitive to external stimuli. Instead, the author suggests that the nervous system plays a crucial role in the functioning of the intestines and the sensation of sleep after a meal.
