tldr: The authors studied the pyrolysis of acetylene at temperatures between 500 to 1000Â°C and found that the reaction follows a second-order kinetic law. The initial product of the reaction is vinylacetylene, and other products like diacetylene, methylacetylene, benzene, and methane are formed through further reactions. The authors proposed a mechanism that accounts for the chain character of the reaction and the existence of equilibria.
