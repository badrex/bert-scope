tldr: The authors provide sufficient and necessary conditions for continuous and compact embeddings of weighted Sobolev spaces into spaces of weighted continuous and Holder continuous functions. They also discuss the behavior of elements of these spaces near their singularities or degeneracies and explore examples of weights studied in the paper.
