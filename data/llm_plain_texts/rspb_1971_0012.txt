tldr: This article discusses the various ways in which viruses can cause genetic modification of host cells, leading to the synthesis of new antigens. It explores four main groups of viral genetic modification, including expression of a persisting non-integrated virus genome, integration of a virus genome into the host cell genome, and the role of viruses in the development of cancer and autoimmunity. The article highlights the importance of understanding these mechanisms for a better understanding of virus carcinogenesis and some aspects of autoimmunity.
