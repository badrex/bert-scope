tldr: The authors describe a portable ophthalmometer that measures the curvature of the cornea to determine corneal astigmatism. The instrument uses a convex lens and a prism to create a virtual image of the object, which is then doubled and inverted using a telescope. This allows for accurate measurements of corneal curvature, making it useful for diagnosing and measuring astigmatism.
