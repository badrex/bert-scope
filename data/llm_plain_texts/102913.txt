tldr: The author, Stephen Gray, observed and documented the appearance and evolution of sunspots, which are dark areas on the Sun's surface. He noticed a triangular-shaped spot accompanied by two smaller ones and tracked their changes over time. His observations helped in understanding the Sun's rotation and the behavior of sunspots.
