tldr: The author studies the influence of isolation on the butterfly species Maniola jurtina, observing that spot distribution on their wings varies depending on the environment. They find that isolation leads to adaptation and the action of natural selection in these populations. This research provides insights into the dynamics of natural populations and the role of isolation in their adaptation.
