tldr: The article investigates semiconductor models that display non-equilibrium phase transitions caused by recombination and generation processes. Formal conditions are established for various reaction kinetic models with phase transitions. Two new classes of band-trap models are constructed, exhibiting first and second-order phase transitions. The study uses macroscopic rate equations for carrier concentrations and assumes the semiconductor is homogeneous, isothermal, non-degenerate, and driven far from thermal equilibrium by light irradiation or external electric fields.
