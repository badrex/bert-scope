tldr: The authors analyze the motion of an overhead trolley wire and a pantograph in response to a train moving at constant speed. They model the pantograph as two masses connected by springs and dampers and study the interaction between the pantograph and the wire. The study provides insights into the contact force and pantograph displacement near a support, helping to determine operating conditions to avoid loss of contact between the pantograph and the wire.
