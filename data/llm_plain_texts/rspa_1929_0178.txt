tldr: This study investigates the amount of hydrogen and oxygen present on the surface of a metallic electrode. The researchers found that the quantity of hydrogen and oxygen on the surface is independent of the nature of the underlying metal and depends only on the accessible surface area. They also discovered that the rate of loss from the surface is a function of time, and the total quantity of electricity needed to change the electrode potential from hydrogen to oxygen or vice versa reaches a limiting minimum value when the current density is high.
