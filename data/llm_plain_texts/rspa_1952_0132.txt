tldr: The authors conducted microwave dielectric measurements on six aqueous protein solutions to analyze water irrotationally bound to proteins. They estimated the maximum amount of bound water as a function of the axial ratio, assuming a spheroid molecule. The results showed that the dielectric constant of aqueous protein solutions is mainly due to the water, with no evidence of relaxation of protein groups in the frequency range studied. This method helps in understanding the physical properties of proteins and their hydration.
