tldr: This study examines the instabilities and hot spots that occur in down-flow packed-bed reactors, which can lead to undesirable side reactions, catalyst degradation, and increased operating costs. A three-dimensional model is used to analyze the effects of fluid flow, mass transfer, heat transfer, and reactant consumption in an adiabatic packed-bed reactor. The results show that uniform flow can become unstable, leading to stationary and time-dependent perturbations, and the boundary of the region of operating conditions causing these instabilities is determined.
