tldr: The authors studied the catalytic and induced oxidation reactions in the presence of cerium salts. They investigated the oxidation potential of potassium arsenite and reducing sugars, such as glucose, lactose, arabinose, galactose, and fructose. The results showed that cerium salts can act as catalysts for the oxidation of these substances, and the potentials of these reactions were analyzed using a controlled electrode.
