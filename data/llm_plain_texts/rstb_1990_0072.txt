tldr: The authors analyzed the sediment cores of two oligotrophic lakes, Devoke Water and Loch Sionascaig, to study their environmental changes over time. They found that Devoke Water experienced a decline in alkalinity and an increase in acidity in the post-1900 sediments, while Loch Sionascaig did not show any such changes. The study helps understand the impact of air pollution on lake ecosystems and assess the likelihood of lake recovery.
