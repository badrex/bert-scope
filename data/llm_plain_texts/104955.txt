tldr: This article describes two successful treatments for diseased knee-joints. The first case was treated with topical applications, including emollient fomentations, mercurial frictions, and gentle purges. The second case required surgery, with two incisions made to evacuate fluid and allow for healing. Both patients recovered well, with one experiencing some stiffness in the joint.
