tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the influence of drawing, annealing, and tempering on the magnetism of steel wires. They discovered that drawing cold steel wires several times after tempering can reverse the temperature coefficient, which affects the magnetic intensity. The results show that the magnetic properties of steel can be significantly altered by the drawing process, but extreme drawing can reduce these changes. The authors also found that giving the wire a period of rest between drawing operations improves the drawing process.
