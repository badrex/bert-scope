revised_title: 'Dioxygen Species Reactivity in Aprotic Media: Implications for Biomembranes'
semantic_tags:
  - 'Dioxygen reactivity'
  - 'Aprotic solvents'

  - 'Oxygen activation'
tldr: The article discusses the reactivity of dioxygen-derived species in aprotic solvents, which provide a model matrix for biomembranes. It explores the differences in acid-base, redox, and nucleophilic properties of superoxide ion in water and aprotic solvents, and its implications for biological systems.
