tldr: James Farquharson conducted experiments to study the effect of the Aurora Borealis on the magnetic needle. He observed that the needle was affected only when the fringes of the aurora were in a specific position. Farquharson concluded that the aurora borealis is situated in the region above the clouds and is an effect of the development of electricity from the condensation of vapor. The phenomenon's relation to magnetism and its connection with electricity are also discussed.
