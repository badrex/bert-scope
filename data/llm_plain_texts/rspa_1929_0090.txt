revised_title: 'Standardizing the Dielectric Constant of Benzene'
semantic_tags:
  - Dielectric constants
  - Benzene
  - Condenser design
  - Liquid properties
  - Standardization
tldr: The authors developed a new method to measure the dielectric constant of liquids with high accuracy, focusing on benzene as a standard liquid. They designed a specialized condenser and tested its effectiveness by comparing it with highly purified samples. This method allowed for more precise measurements and better comparison of dielectric constants among different substances.
