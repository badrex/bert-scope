tldr: This article explores the reflection of sound from porous surfaces and introduces the concept of acoustical admittance to calculate the absorption coefficient for various sound-absorbing materials. The author demonstrates that this new approach can be applied to any type of sound-absorbing substance and provides a method to calculate absorption at different angles of incidence.
