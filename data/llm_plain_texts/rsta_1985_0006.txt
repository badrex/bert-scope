tldr: This article discusses the electronic properties of conjugated polymers, focusing on the nature of defect states such as solitons, polarons, and bipolarons in doped materials. The authors present a wide range of physical measurements on various conjugated polymers, including polyacetylene, poly(phenylenesulphide), and poly(diphenylenediphenylvinylene), and explore the relationship between morphology, chain conjugation length, and defect state behavior.
