tldr: The article presents a mathematical formulation to evaluate the elastodynamic Green tensor in terms of five scalar potentials for inhomogeneous elastic media. The authors demonstrate the method by solving the equations for special media and various unipolar and bipolar source configurations. This study provides a new approach to understanding wave propagation in inhomogeneous media and has applications in various disciplines of science and engineering.
