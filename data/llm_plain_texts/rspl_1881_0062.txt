tldr: The authors, G. D. Liveing and J. Dewar, discuss their observations on the reversal of the spectrum of cyanogen. They found that the photographs provided evidence of nitrogen in comets, in addition to carbon and hydrogen. The authors also mention the strong intensity of certain lines in the photographs, which indicates that the light emitted by the cometary matter exceeded the reflected solar light. They reserve further theoretical suggestions for future work.
