tldr: The authors studied the hydrolysis of methyl halides (chloride, bromide, and iodide) in water and measured their rates over a wide range of temperatures. They determined the thermodynamic parameters for the activation process and the transition state, providing insights into the reaction mechanism and the role of water in the hydrolysis process.
