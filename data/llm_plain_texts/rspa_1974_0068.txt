tldr: This article discusses the application of equilibrium statistical mechanics to lattice polymer models, focusing on the phase transitions and thermodynamics of these systems. The author presents five different models and compares their transition behaviors, highlighting the limitations of the Flory-Huggins approximate theory in predicting the exact phase transition behavior.
