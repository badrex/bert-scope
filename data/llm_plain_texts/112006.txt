tldr: The author, Alexander J. Ellis, explores the conditions, extent, and realization of a perfect musical scale on instruments with fixed tones. He introduces a new notation system to represent tones and pitches accurately and discusses the necessary conditions for a perfect scale. Ellis also investigates the relationships between chords and the formation of scales, ultimately proposing a system of 15 keys and 72 tones per octave.
