tldr: In December 1741, parhelia, or "mock suns," were observed in Kent. The author, Mrs. Tennison, reported her findings, and the event was also documented by Dr. Stukeley, who received a drawing from Mrs. Tennison. This phenomenon occurs when sunlight is refracted through ice crystals in the atmosphere, creating a colorful display in the sky.
