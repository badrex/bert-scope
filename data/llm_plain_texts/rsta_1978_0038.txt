tldr: This article discusses a model of volcanic plumbing and the thermal history of magmas. It highlights that erupted lavas may be 100-250°C cooler than the parental magma entering the magma chamber, and that observations of erupted lavas do not form a useful reference point for reconstructing the thermal budget of the igneous process. The energy content of a volcano may be greater than indicated by the rate of energy output as lava, and the model may also apply to the volcanic heat budget at mid-ocean ridges.
