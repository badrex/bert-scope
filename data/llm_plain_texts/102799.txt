tldr: The author, Stephen Gray, describes his observations of fossils in Kent, specifically the blackened tree trunks and shells found in the cliffs. He also presents a new method for drawing a meridian line using an instrument with two sights and a straight ruler. This method is easy to use and provides accurate results.
