tldr: The authors discovered that opsonins, substances that help the immune system recognize and engulf foreign particles, are produced when foreign red blood cells are injected into the body. They developed a method to estimate the amount of opsonin in a serum by observing the interaction between red blood cells and leucocytes. This research contributes to understanding the immune system's response to foreign substances and could have implications for medical treatments.
