tldr: This study investigates the effects of pressure on isoelectric gelatin gels and their water relations. The researchers found that weaker gels hold their water content with stronger forces than more concentrated gels, and as pressure increases, a larger amount of closely bound water is removed. The relationship between swelling pressure and the activity of water in the gel is also examined.
