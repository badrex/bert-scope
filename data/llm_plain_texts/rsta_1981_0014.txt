tldr: The article presents the Central Electricity Generating Board's (C.E.G.B.) approach to assess defects in structures using fracture mechanics. The method involves calculating two parameters, and, which define the state of a structure under different loading conditions. The failure assessment diagram is used to determine if failure is imminent. The C.E.G.B. approach can handle various factors, such as thermal and residual stresses, and ductile crack growth, making it versatile in assessing the safety of structures.
