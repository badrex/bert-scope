tldr: This article presents an attempt to improve the molecular orbital theory for paired electrons in chemical bonds. The authors focus on the interaction of paired electrons in the same orbital and propose a new method to describe the wave function and energy of the electrons. This development aims to address the limitations of previous methods, such as the valence bond method, and provide a more accurate representation of the stability of chemical bonds.
