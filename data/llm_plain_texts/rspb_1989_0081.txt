tldr: 'A computer model is used to study the maintenance and breakdown of the Hydra-Chlorella symbiosis. The model suggests that multiple mechanisms are needed to produce a stable symbiotic relationship. Observations show that the growth of endosymbiotic algae, Chlorella, in Hydra digestive cells is regulated. The model tests different hypotheses about the cause of overgrowth and finds that a combination of factors, including nutrient availability and algal interference with host cell division, contribute to the regulation of the symbiosis.'
