tldr: The author examines fossilized remains of the soft parts of Foraminifera found in chalk and flint in the South-East of England. They discovered that the soft parts of these tiny organisms were preserved in an unmineralized state, similar to insects in amber. This finding sheds light on the fossilization process and the preservation of delicate organic structures over time.
