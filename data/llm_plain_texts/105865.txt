tldr: In 1743, John Winthrop observed the transit of Mercury over the Sun from Cambridge, New England. By comparing his observation with those made in Europe, he aimed to determine the longitude of Cambridge with greater accuracy. The observation involved using a 24-foot telescope and adjusting his clock by correspondent altitudes of the Sun and a bright star in Aries.
