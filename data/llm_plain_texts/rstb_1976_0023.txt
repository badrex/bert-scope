tldr: This article discusses the water relations of plants, focusing on the role of stomata in regulating water movement and transpiration. The author explains how stomata control the uptake of carbon dioxide and water loss, and how this balance is crucial for plant survival. The article also explores the differences in water potential and resistance in plants and the atmosphere, and how these factors affect transpiration rates.
