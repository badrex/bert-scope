  - Microbial Growth
tldr: The article investigates the growth characteristics of different strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae when using various carbon sources. The strains can adapt to different substrates through training, which improves their growth rate and efficiency. The tricarboxylic acid cycle is found to be one of the routes for glucose metabolism in yeast, but other routes also exist, forming an interconnected network for carbon source metabolism.
