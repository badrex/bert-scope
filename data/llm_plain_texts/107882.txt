tldr: The author investigates the diurnal variation of the magnetic needle and explores the relationship between temperature and magnetism. They conducted experiments using a bismuth and copper ring, finding that magnetic phenomena were exhibited when heat was applied to different points in the ring. The author suggests that the disturbance of the equilibrium of temperature in the earth's atmosphere and land or water may be responsible for some of the phenomena of terrestrial magnetism.
