tldr: The author presents a new hygrometer design that uses concentrated sulfuric acid to measure humidity. The instrument consists of three thermometers, a wet bulb, a dry bulb, and an acid bulb, which are read together for comparison. The acid bulb thermometer measures the amount of moisture absorbed by the acid on its surface, providing a more accurate and practical method for hygrometric measurements.
