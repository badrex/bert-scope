tldr: This article discusses the challenges in determining the energetic efficiency of photosynthesis in green plants. The authors explore the absorption of energy by the chloroplast pigments in living cells and the factors affecting the efficiency, such as the amount of energy lost through reflection and the molecular mechanisms of the reaction. They also analyze the complex physiological setting of the reaction in the living cell and the limitations of current experimental methods.
