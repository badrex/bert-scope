tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the optical activity of hemoglobin and globin. They found that hemoglobin, a complex protein, exhibits unique properties such as color, ability to form compounds with oxygen, and crystallization. The research showed that hemoglobin is a left-handed (levorotatory) protein, and its optical activity is not affected by the presence of oxygen or carbon monoxide in its structure. This study is important for understanding the properties of proteins and their interactions with other molecules.
