tldr: This article presents the refractive indices of various types of glass, including Soft Crown, Light Flint, and Dense Flint. The author used prisms and lenses to measure the indices and found that all glasses exhibit a similar point of inflexion in their dispersion curves. The results provide valuable information for understanding the physical properties of glass and its applications in optics.
