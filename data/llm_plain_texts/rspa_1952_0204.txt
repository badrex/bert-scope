tldr: This study investigates the oriented chemical growth of oxides on single crystals of zinc and cadmium, focusing on the relationship between the orientation of the overgrowth and the topography of the substrate surface. The authors find that the orientation of the oxide depends on the type of facet and the surface topography of the substrate. They also discover that the inner potentials of zinc and zinc oxide have been measured, providing insights into the properties of these materials.
