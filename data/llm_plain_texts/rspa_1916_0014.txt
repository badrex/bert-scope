tldr: The authors explore the motion of a fluid past a curved boundary, focusing on the flow of a fluid with low viscosity. They use conformal transformations to analyze the problem and develop a method to transform the area into the upper half of the complex plane, providing insights into fluid dynamics and aeronautics.
