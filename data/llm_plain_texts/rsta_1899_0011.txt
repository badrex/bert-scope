tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the electrical conductivity of flames containing salt vapours. They found that the conductivity is due to partial ionization of the salt by the high temperature of the flame, and that the conductivity of a flame containing a salt vapour is very similar to the conductivity of an aqueous solution of the salt. The results showed that the current depends greatly on the negative electrode and that the resistance to the passage of the current is at or near the surface of the negative electrode.
