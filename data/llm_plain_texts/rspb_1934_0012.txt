tldr: This article discusses the detection of linkage in human families, specifically focusing on cases where one heterozygous genotype is indeterminate. The author explains that when one heterozygous genotype is determinate, the mathematical solution of the problem is analogous to the application of the product method to gene substitutions with respect to both heterozygous genotypes being determinate.
