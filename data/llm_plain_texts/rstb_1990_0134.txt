tldr: This article investigates the migration patterns of nocturnal grasshoppers in West Africa and their concentration by wind convergence. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for air-to-air pest control, specifically the use of radar technology to locate and spray insecticide on concentrated grasshopper populations. They conclude that while the concept is promising, more research is needed to determine its feasibility and effectiveness.
