tldr: The authors conducted experiments with electrolytically produced luminosity and discovered that duralumin alloy provided a much greater luminous effect than previous alloys. They developed a method to create a large number of separately controllable luminous units, which could be used for various purposes, including the reproduction of photographs. This research offers a new means of creating an almost unlimited number of luminous areas that can be controlled and graded in luminosity.
