tldr: The author explores cyclides and sphero-quartics, discussing their equations, properties, and methods of generation. They demonstrate how these geometric shapes can be transformed and classified, and explain their connections to quadrics and other shapes in geometry. The paper also covers the various ways to generate cyclides and sphero-quartics, as well as their applications in geometry and beyond.
