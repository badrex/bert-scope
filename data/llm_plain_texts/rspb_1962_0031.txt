tldr: The authors conducted experiments on HeLa cells to examine the relationship between nuclear and cytoplasmic ribonucleic acid (RNA). They found that the labelled nuclear RNA was not transferred to the cytoplasm in a stable form but was rapidly broken down within the cell. This study suggests that at least some nuclear RNA is labile in many animal and plant cells.
