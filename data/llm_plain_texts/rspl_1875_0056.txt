tldr: The author conducted an experiment on electro-magnetic rotation using an induction coil and a magnet. They observed that when a spark discharge occurred, it formed a spiral shape influenced by the direction of the current and magnetic polarity. This phenomenon provided insights into the interaction between electric currents and magnetic fields.
