tldr: 'Ralph Thoresby, F.R.S., shares the discovery of Roman coins found at Clifton near Edlington in Yorkshire. The coins were found in a dry soil, preserving them well. Thoresby speculates that the coins were hidden by people involved in a conflict and remained buried until their discovery. The coins provide a variety of reverses, adding to the collection of Roman history and numismatics.'
