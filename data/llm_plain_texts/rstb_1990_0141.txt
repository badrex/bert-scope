tldr: This article discusses progress in controlling the reinvasion of windborne vectors, particularly Simulium sirbanum and S. damnosum, in the Onchocerciasis Control Programme in West Africa. The authors describe efforts to identify sources, track migration pathways, and implement vector control measures to reduce transmission of onchocerciasis. They also discuss the challenges faced, such as insecticide resistance and the need to maintain ecological balance in treated rivers.
