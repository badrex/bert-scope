tldr: The author presents a study of the spectra of 171 brighter stars, using photographic techniques to analyze their light compositions. The research aims to test the meteoritic hypothesis, which suggests that celestial bodies are or have been swarms of meteorites. The study provides a new classification of celestial bodies based on their spectra, revealing the differences in temperature and physical conditions of various stars.
