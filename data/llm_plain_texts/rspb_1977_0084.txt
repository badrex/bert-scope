tldr: The article investigates the effects of photolysable 2-azido analogues of adenosine, AMP, and ADP on human platelets. The results show that 2-azido-ADP is more potent in causing aggregation than ADP, while 2-azidoadenosine and 2-azido-AMP inhibit platelet aggregation effectively. The study suggests that these analogues can be used as potential affinity labels for the receptors involved in platelet activation.
