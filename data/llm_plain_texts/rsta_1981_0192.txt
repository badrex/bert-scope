tldr: This article discusses circulation and fronts in continental shelf seas, focusing on the influence of the deep ocean, shelf break, and continental shelf. It highlights the importance of wind-driven circulation, density-driven circulation, and the role of fronts in cross-frontal mixing. The authors also explore the need for further research on the evolution and stability of fronts, the processes of cross-frontal and cross-shelf mixing, and the relation of physical processes to the growth of phytoplankton in the vicinity of fronts.
