tldr: The author conducted an experiment to study the reaction between carbonic oxide and sodium-alcohol. They found that the formic acid produced in a previous experiment came from hydrate of soda, not from the sodium-alcohol. This research supports the idea that sodium-alcohol does not react with carbonic oxide.
