tldr: This study investigates the hygroscopic action of cotton when exposed to different humidity levels. The authors found that the amount of moisture absorbed by cotton is dependent on the surrounding humidity and temperature, and that cotton behaves similarly to an aqueous solution in its moisture absorption properties. The research also highlights the importance of proper experimental methods and conditions to accurately measure the hygroscopic behavior of cotton.
