tldr: The authors discovered a protein called the'repressor' in non-permissive SV40-transformed cells that specifically inhibits SV40 plaque formation in permissive cells. The'repressor' is made in both productive and abortive infections, but its effect can be counteracted by a constitutive protein present only in permissive cells.
