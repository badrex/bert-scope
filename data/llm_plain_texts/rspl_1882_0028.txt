tldr: 'In 1882, William Huggins observed and photographed the spectrum of Comet Wells, discovering that it had a unique spectrum that differed from previously examined comets. The comet's spectrum contained bright lines of sodium vapor and other bright lines, while the hydrocarbon bands were less prominent. This finding expanded our understanding of the composition of comets and their spectra.'
