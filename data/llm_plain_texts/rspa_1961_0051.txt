tldr: This article investigates the development of electric potentials in ice crystals under the influence of temperature gradients. It explains how a steady temperature gradient leads to a potential difference across the ice, with the colder end being positively charged and the warmer end negatively charged. The authors also study the effect of impurities on the charge separation and discuss the potential role of these phenomena in the generation of electric charge in thunderstorms.
