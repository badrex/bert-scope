tldr: The author studied the protrusion and contraction of protoplasmic filaments from the glandular hairs of the common teasel plant. They discovered that these filaments contain living protoplasm and can contract in response to various factors like acids, alkaline solutions, temperature, and mechanical stimulation. The protrusion process is believed to be related to the secretion of resinous matter and may play a role in the plant's absorption of nitrogenous matter from its environment.
