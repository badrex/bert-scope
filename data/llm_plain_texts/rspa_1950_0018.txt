tldr: 'The authors developed a new method called flash photolysis and spectroscopy to study free radical reactions. This technique uses high-power gas-filled flash discharge tubes to create a high concentration of free radicals, allowing for the use of absorption spectroscopy to investigate their reactions. The method is particularly useful for studying the chemistry of intermediate compounds and provides a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of free radicals in photochemical reactions.'
