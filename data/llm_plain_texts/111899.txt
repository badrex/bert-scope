tldr: This article investigates the phenomena of residuary charge and the law of exploding distance in electrical accumulation on coated glass. The author, W. Snow Harris, examines the factors affecting explosive discharge and challenges previous theories by Cavendish and Faraday. Harris concludes that the amount of residuary charge cannot be explained by spreading of electricity on the glass or penetration into its substance, and suggests a new explanation for this phenomenon.
