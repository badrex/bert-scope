tldr: The author presents a simple and easy-to-construct instrument called the "Collision Predictor" to help mariners predict and avoid collisions at sea. The instrument uses geometric constructions and measurements of distance and speed to determine the risk of collision between two vessels. This method saves time and is more practical for seamen compared to complex geometrical constructions.
