tldr: 'William Herschel observed the satellites of the Georgian Planet using a 20-feet telescope and recorded their positions, orbits, and visibility. He determined the nodes of the first two satellites and their periodic times. Herschel also estimated the distances to which the satellites must move from the planet before becoming visible through the telescope.'
