tldr: The authors describe the magnetic method for producing extremely low temperatures and their experiments using this method. They discuss the theoretical considerations and the cooling effects achieved with different substances, including gadolinium sulfate. The magnetic method is based on the isothermal magnetization and subsequent demagnetization of paramagnetic salts, which leads to a lowering of the temperature. This method has the potential to reach temperatures close to absolute zero, which was previously unattainable using other methods.
