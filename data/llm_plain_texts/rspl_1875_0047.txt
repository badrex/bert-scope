revised_title: The Influence of Coal-Dust in Colliery Explosions
semantic_tags:
  - Coal mining safety
  - Combustible dust
  - Gas explosions
  - Mine safety
  - Explosives
tldr: This article discusses the role of coal-dust in colliery explosions and how it can be a cause of danger in coal mines. The author explains that coal-dust mixed with air and firedamp can be explosive at ordinary pressure and temperature, leading to severe accidents in mines. The author also shares experiments conducted to test the flammability of coal-dust and air mixtures, concluding that they are not inherently explosive.
