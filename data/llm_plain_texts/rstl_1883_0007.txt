tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments using Lorentz's method to determine the absolute value of the British Association Unit of Resistance. They developed a new method that eliminated the need for comparing small resistances with standard units. The results confirmed previous findings and provided a more accurate and efficient way to measure electrical resistance.'
