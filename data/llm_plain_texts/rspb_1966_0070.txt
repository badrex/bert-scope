tldr: The article investigates the distribution and localization of biogenic monoamines in the nervous system of the polychaete Nephtys using a specific fluorescence method. The central nervous system contains both green fluorescent (adrenergic) and yellow fluorescent (5-hydroxytryptaminergic) fibers and neurons. The study suggests that the green system may have a sensory function, while the yellow system may have a motor function.
