tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments with a Röntgen ray tube using various elements as anticathodes and investigated the effects of different metal screens on the radiations. They found that the relative intensities of the radiations do not follow the order of atomic weights and that selective transmission of radiation occurs when the screen and radiator are of the same metal. The authors also studied the absorption and transmission of rays, and the role of secondary radiation and scattering in the process.'
