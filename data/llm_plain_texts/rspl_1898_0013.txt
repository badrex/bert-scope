tldr: This article examines the relationship between the diurnal range of magnet declination and horizontal force with the period of solar spot frequency. The author compares the magnetic periods with the sunspot periods and finds that they vary in a similar manner. The study provides insights into the connection between solar and terrestrial phenomena and the possible influence of sunspots on Earth's magnetic field.
