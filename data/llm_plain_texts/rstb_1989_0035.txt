tldr: This article explores the immune recognition of protein antigens and how the T-cell receptor recognizes the HLA class II-peptide complex. The authors demonstrate that a point mutation in the peptide determinant can reverse the major histocompatibility complex restriction of a T-cell clone. They also discuss the importance of the formation of a peptide-HLA complex for both cellular and humoral immune responses.
