tldr: The author investigates the exact form of waves in deep water, specifically focusing on trochoidal waves. They prove that these waves fulfill the conditions of uniform pressure and continuity, and explain the relationship between the thickness of the wave layer and the normal distance from the surface. This research contributes to a better understanding of wave behavior and ocean dynamics.
