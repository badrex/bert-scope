tldr: The author examines the reproductive strategies of Cardamine pratensis and Cardamine palustris, focusing on their specialized foliar vivipary and its impact on natural selection. The study reveals that these species rely heavily on vegetative reproduction, which has allowed them to maintain types that would otherwise have insufficient survival potential due to low seed productivity.
