tldr: The authors present a theoretical study of radially symmetric phase growth controlled by diffusion, focusing on spherical and cylindrical symmetry. They provide a solution to the diffusion equation for material and heat diffusion, which can be applied to various practical cases, such as crystal growth, droplet growth, and the growth of a new phase in a uniform medium.
