tldr: The authors propose a new equation for the electrostatic terms of activity and osmotic coefficients in electrolyte solutions, which improves upon the Debye-Huckel equation. This new equation accurately represents the behavior of electrolytes at high concentrations and is applicable to a wide range of electrolyte types. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of this equation by comparing it to previous models and experimental data.
