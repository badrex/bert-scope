tldr: 'This study investigates the genetics of homostyly in populations of Primula vulgaris, where both male and female reproductive organs are present in the same flower. The research explores the factors affecting homostyle frequencies, including self-fertilization, crossing between homostyles, and viability disturbances. The findings suggest that the tendency of homostyles to cross-fertilize acts as a buffering mechanism against the reversal of an outcrossing system to inbreeding.'
