tldr: The author, David Brewster, conducted experiments on the depolarisation of light in various mineral, animal, and vegetable bodies. He discovered that certain substances, like mica and calcareous spar, could depolarise light, meaning they could remove the polarity that light had acquired through reflection or transmission. Brewster's findings expanded our understanding of the optical properties of different materials and their structures, providing insights into the animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms.
