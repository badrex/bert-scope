tldr: The author investigates the production and dissipation of vorticity in a turbulent fluid using a wind tunnel. They found that the rate of destruction of vorticity by viscosity is four times greater than the rate at which vorticity disappears, indicating that the stretching of vortex filaments is the main cause of the high dissipation rate associated with turbulent motion.
