tldr: The authors determined detonation parameters for oxygen mixtures with homologous hydrocarbons at ambient pressure and temperature. They found detonation limits for various hydrocarbons and established behavior in homologous series. The study suggests that the structure of fuel molecules has a secondary influence on detonation limits, with factors like critical temperature rise and condensation of cracking products playing a more significant role.
