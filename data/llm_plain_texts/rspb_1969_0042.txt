revised_title: 'Cytoplasmic Influence on Nucleus During Cell Differentiation in Amphibians'
semantic_tags:
  - Cell differentiation
  - Nucleo-cytoplasmic interactions
  - RNA synthesis
  - Amphibian embryogenesis
  - Gene regulation
tldr: The authors investigate the influence of the cytoplasm on the nucleus during cell differentiation in amphibians, focusing on RNA synthesis during early embryonic development. They find that egg cytoplasm contains components that control the repression and initiation of different RNA classes, showing that cytoplasmic control is essential for gene activity during early animal development.
