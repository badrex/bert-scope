tldr: This article investigates the optical properties of metal glasses, colloidal solutions, and metallic films by analyzing their microstructures and calculating their optical constants. The author discusses the effects of different microstructures, such as amorphous, granular, and spicular, on the colors and properties of these materials. The study provides a foundation for understanding the behavior of metals in various forms and applications.
