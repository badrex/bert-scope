tldr: This article discusses the development and use of instrumented moorings to measure ocean currents in the western Atlantic. It describes the various types of moorings and their capabilities, as well as the different types of motions observed in the ocean currents. The study focuses on inertio-gravitational internal waves, their frequencies, and their effects on the overall kinetic energy spectrum.
