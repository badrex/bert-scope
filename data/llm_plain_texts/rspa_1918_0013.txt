tldr: The author discusses the photoelectric effect and the interaction of X-rays with matter. They propose that the energy of X-rays is related to the energy of electrons and that the energy of emitted radiation is proportional to the energy of absorbed radiation. The author also suggests that the photoelectric effect is a quantum phenomenon and that the energy of X-rays is quantized.
