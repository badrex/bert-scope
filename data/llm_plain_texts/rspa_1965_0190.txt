tldr: The authors observed an electron absorption spectrum attributed to phenyl radicals in the visible region after flash photolysis of benzene and halogenobenzenes. They analyzed the vibrational structure of the phenyl spectrum and found two fundamental frequencies at 671 and 890, corresponding to the and frequencies of the state of benzene. The main products of the reaction were diphenyl and other substituted diphenyls, indicating that phenyl radicals disappear mainly by dimerization.
