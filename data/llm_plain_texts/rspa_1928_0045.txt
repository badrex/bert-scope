revised_title: 'Stability Analysis of Fluid Motion and Its Relation to Heat Conduction'
semantic_tags:
  - Fluid dynamics
  - Heat conduction
  - Stability analysis
  - Thermal convection
  - Boundary layer theory
tldr: The author investigates the stability of a layer of incompressible fluid when the temperature decreases upwards. They analyze various scenarios, including rigid conducting boundaries, and discuss the effects of heat conduction and viscosity on fluid motion. The author also explores the analogy between fluid layers heated from below and liquid between rotating coaxial cylinders.
