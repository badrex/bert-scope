tldr: The article investigates the dielectric loss characteristics of chlorinated diphenyl, a synthetic insulating material. The study examines the material's power factor and dielectric constant over a range of frequencies and temperatures. The results show that the material's performance is highly sensitive to temperature changes, and it can be used as a dielectric medium under specific conditions. The research also discusses the physical factors controlling the position of the power factor maximum in the frequency and temperature spectrum.
