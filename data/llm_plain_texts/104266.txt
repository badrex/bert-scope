tldr: The author describes three unusual tree phenomena observed in Whinfield-Park, including a spiral cut in a tree trunk, a large deer horn embedded in an oak, and the possibility of similar figures found in trees being the result of human intervention. The embedded deer horn is considered a remarkable instance of a foreign object being lodged in a tree's wood.
