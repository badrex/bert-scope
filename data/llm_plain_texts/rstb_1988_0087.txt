tldr: This study examines the coloration and development of body patterns in young cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) from hatching to adulthood. The research explores the 13 body patterns, their components, and how they change with age. It also investigates the neural control of patterning and its relation to behavior, including concealment and signaling. The findings provide a baseline for future studies on the neural control of chromatic behavior in cephalopods.
