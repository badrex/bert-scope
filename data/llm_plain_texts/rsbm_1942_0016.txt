tldr: Joseph Larmor was a prominent physicist who made significant contributions to the field during a critical period in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His work on the aether theory, which he developed further by incorporating electromagnetic field phenomena, helped lay the groundwork for modern physics. Despite facing challenges and changes in scientific thought, Larmor's ideas and theories remain relevant today.
