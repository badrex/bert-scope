tldr: The authors conducted a geological survey of the Bristol Channel floor using side-scan sonar, Boomer, and gravity corer. They discovered two major synclines trending WNW-ESE, with a minor pericline in between. The eastern syncline preserves Upper Pliensbachian (Lower Jurassic) rocks in its core. The Jurassic sequence in the area is unusual for its abnormal thickness and predominantly argillaceous nature. The findings provide evidence for the origin and geological history of the Bristol Channel.
