tldr: The author presents a new definition for infinite integrals, which can be used to calculate the convolution and multiplication of generalized functions. This new definition is a natural extension of the one used for finite intervals and can handle a wider range of generalized functions. The author also demonstrates the applicability of the theory through various examples.
