tldr: The author studies the skeletal development in three species of echinoderms: Arbacia, Echinarachnius, and Leptasterias. They analyze the echinopluteus larval stage and its transformation into the adult form, focusing on the formation of the test and the role of calcareous elements in the process. The study provides insights into the comparative embryology of these species and contributes to the understanding of echinoderm development.
