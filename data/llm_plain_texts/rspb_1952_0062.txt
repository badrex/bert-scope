tldr: The authors used ultra-violet microspectrography to study the absorbing substances in living cell nuclei. They found that the absorbing material in tissue culture interphase nuclei doubles during the time since the previous mitosis. This suggests that deoxyribose nucleic acid (DNA) is synthesized during interphase, and the additional absorbing molecules may include DNA precursors. This discovery challenges the previous belief that DNA synthesis only occurs during prophase.
