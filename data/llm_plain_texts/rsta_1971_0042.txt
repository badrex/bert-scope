tldr: This article discusses the aerodynamic behavior of bodies in the wakes of other bodies, focusing on the properties of wakes that influence loads on other bodies placed in the wake. It includes unsteady irrotational flow outside the true wake and considers the wakes of three-dimensional bluff bodies. The results are presented in the form of an aerodynamic admittance, and experiments are used to illustrate the type of problem associated with determining loads on a bluff body in a wake.
