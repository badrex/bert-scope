tldr: The author examines the Middle Cambrian trilobite Naraoia compacta from the Burgess Shale in British Columbia. They describe the morphology, internal anatomy, and appendages of the trilobite, and discuss its mode of life and possible relationships. The study reveals that Naraoia compacta was a benthonic predator and scavenger, with unique features like gill branches and a lack of an articulated thorax, making it a separate order within the class Trilobita.
