tldr: This article discusses the structure of proteins, specifically focusing on peptide chain models in relation to crystallographic data for gramicidin B and insulin. The authors analyze the chemical and crystallographic evidence for these molecules and explore different chain models, including the a-helix model proposed by Pauling, Corey, and Branson. They also consider the implications of cystine residues and the complexities of X-ray patterns observed in natural a-keratin fibers.
