tldr: The article discusses the Antarctic Expedition led by Sir James Clark Ross, which aimed to map the magnetic elements in the southern hemisphere. Edward Sabine describes the magnetic survey conducted by Lieutenant Henry Clerk, who used a magnetic observatory at the Cape of Good Hope to gather data. The survey aimed to complete the mapping of high latitudes and understand the influence of a ship's iron on magnetic instruments. The findings of this survey would help improve the accuracy of compass readings and contribute to the understanding of terrestrial magnetism.
