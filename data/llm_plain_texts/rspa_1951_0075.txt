tldr: The authors studied the magnetic properties of several paramagnetic crystals from the iron group at low temperatures. They measured the principal magnetic susceptibilities and anisotropies, finding that the magnetic properties of these crystals are influenced by the crystal field strength and its asymmetry. The results provide insights into the magnetic behavior of these materials and their potential applications.
