tldr: 'This article discusses the absorption spectrum and fluorescence of mercury vapour. The author, W. N. Hartley, conducted experiments using a flask of purified mercury vapour and a quartz spectrograph to study the absorption spectrum. The results showed a sharply defined absorption band in the spectrum, and the fluorescence was observed to occur between a specific temperature range. The author also examined the absorption spectrum of a mercuric chloride solution and found no visible absorption band, only a continuous absorption at the more refrangible end of the spectrum.'
