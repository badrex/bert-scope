tldr: The authors studied the effects of radiolysis on aqueous systems, specifically the forms of hydrogen and hydroxyl radicals. They found that nitrous oxide influences the reactions and can produce nitrogen gas. The results provide insights into the radiation chemistry of aqueous solutions and the potential for using nitrous oxide to study isotope effects in neutral and alkaline solutions.
