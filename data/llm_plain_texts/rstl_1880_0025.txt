tldr: The author conducted experiments using a whirling machine to improve the accuracy of cup anemometer constants. They found that comparing two similar anemometers with different frictions could help account for the uncertainty caused by the air's vorticose motion. The author also developed a new method for measuring brake friction during experiments, which led to more accurate results.
