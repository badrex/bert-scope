tldr: This article describes experiments conducted by Thomas Hutchins and Joseph Black to determine the freezing point of mercury in Hudson's Bay. They used various thermometers and freezing mixtures to observe the congelation of mercury and the effects of cold on its properties. The experiments helped to improve the accuracy of temperature measurements and contributed to the understanding of thermodynamics.
