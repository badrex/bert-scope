tldr: 'The authors describe a multiple beam interferometric procedure to study the surface topography of crystal faces, specifically a (100) face of a left-handed quartz crystal. They reveal details of the surface structure that cannot be detected by microscopes or gonimeters. The method can measure face angles as small as 1/50th of a minute of arc and has potential applications in understanding crystal growth, strength, and cleavage behavior.'
