tldr: The author, C.F. SchÃ¶nbein, studied the odor that accompanies electrolysis of water and found that it is only released at the positive electrode. He discovered that the odoriferous principle can be preserved in closed glass bottles and is produced by gold and platina metals, as well as dilute acids and salt solutions. The odor can be eliminated by raising the temperature or adding certain substances like charcoal, iron, or mercury. This research sheds light on the relationship between electricity and odor.
