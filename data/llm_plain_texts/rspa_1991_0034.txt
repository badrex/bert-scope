tldr: The author develops a new convective variational approach to create relativistic thermodynamic models for viscous conducting fluid media. The approach uses a master function to determine dynamically conjugate variables and allows for the inclusion of effects of viscosity. This category of models is intended to include the standard Israel-Stewart formalism in the limit of small deviations from thermodynamic equilibrium.
