tldr: This study investigates the properties of torsional vibrations in reciprocating engine shafts, focusing on the critical speed ranges and the effects of different piston masses. The authors analyze the behavior of the shaft using an experimental setup and compare the results with theoretical calculations. They find that the amplitude of vibrations is large within specific speed ranges, and the frequency of vibration varies depending on the piston weight and shaft speed.
