tldr: In the late 17th century, a group of English merchants from the Aleppo factory embarked on two voyages to explore the ancient city of Tadmor, also known as Palmyra. They documented their journeys, providing detailed accounts of the ruins, local culture, and encounters with the Arab people. Their findings offer valuable insights into the history and culture of the region during that time.
