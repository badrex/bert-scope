tldr: The authors conducted experiments on amphibian metamorphosis, specifically in Axolotls, to understand the role of internal secretions, such as thyroid, in the process. They found that thyroid feeding accelerated metamorphosis and that sexual maturity increased the time required for metamorphosis. The study also revealed that certain internal changes, like egg production, may be affected by thyroid feeding.
