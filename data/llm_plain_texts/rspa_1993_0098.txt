tldr: The synchrotron Laue method allows for rapid data collection from protein crystals using intense, polychromatic X-ray beams. This technique enables time-resolved crystallography studies and has been used to analyze various protein structures. Recent developments in the Laue method include the use of image plates as detectors, large toast-racks for spatially overlapping spots, and a new monochromatic method called LOT to improve low-resolution data sampling. The method's importance lies in its ability to study biologically reactive molecules in the crystalline state.
