tldr: The authors studied the development and differentiation of photoreceptors and pigment epithelium in the larval Xenopus retina. They found that rod outer segments and cone outer segments have different ultrastructural appearances and labeling patterns during development. The authors also observed that the rate of outer segment growth and disk shedding varies during different stages of development. This research provides valuable insights into the development of the visual system and the processes of photoreceptor differentiation and outer segment renewal.
