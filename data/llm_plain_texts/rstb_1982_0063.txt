tldr: This article discusses the importance of recognizing mixed substrates, mixed cultures, and microbial communities in the field of environmental microbiology, particularly in the biodegradation of synthetic and xenobiotic compounds. The author argues that microbial communities can function through synergistic mechanisms to break down these compounds more effectively than single species of microorganisms. The article also highlights the limitations of traditional pure-culture techniques and emphasizes the need to consider the heterogeneity of natural environments in biodegradation studies.
