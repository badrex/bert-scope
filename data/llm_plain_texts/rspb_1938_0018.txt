tldr: The study investigates the impact of fasting on the transmission of Hyoscyamus virus 3 by the aphid Myzus persicae. The research found that fasting aphids before feeding on infected plants significantly increased their infectivity. The findings suggest that the transmission of the virus is not solely a mechanical process and that the aphid plays a role in the virus's behavior.
