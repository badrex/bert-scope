tldr: Dr. Dobson conducted experiments to determine if evaporation is a better test of the moisture or dryness of the atmosphere than the quantity of rain. He set up two vessels in Liverpool to measure evaporation and rainfall and found that evaporation is a more accurate indicator of the atmosphere's dryness. This research also showed the importance of considering factors like temperature, wind, and soil type when studying the effects of rainfall and evaporation.
