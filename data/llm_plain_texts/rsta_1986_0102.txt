tldr: This study examines the lipid composition of a recent sapropel and associated sediments from the Hellenic Outer Ridge in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. The research focuses on understanding the formation of these organic-rich layers and the potential factors contributing to their formation, such as anoxic conditions, increased biological production, or a combination of both. The lipid composition suggests a predominantly marine-derived input of organic matter, with differences in the composition between the sapropel and non-sapropelic sediments indicating varying inputs and environmental conditions.
