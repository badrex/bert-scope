tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the effect of light on protoplasm and bacteria. They discovered that light is inimical to the development of bacteria and can prevent their growth. The study also showed that different wavelengths of light have varying effects on bacterial growth, with blue and violet rays being the most active. The findings have implications for understanding the role of light in controlling bacterial growth and preventing decay.
