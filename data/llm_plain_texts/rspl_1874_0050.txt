tldr: The authors conducted experiments using a chloride-of-silver battery and vacuum tubes to study electrical discharges in a vacuum. They discovered that by connecting the battery to coil-accumulators, they could create well-defined stratifications in the vacuum tube. This phenomenon appeared to be caused by periodic overflows that interfered with the current waves, creating nodes of greater resistance in the medium.
