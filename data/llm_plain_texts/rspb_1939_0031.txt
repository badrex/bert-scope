tldr: This study investigates the factors that cause individual differences in dark adaptation, such as pupil diameter, color, visual acuity, and age. The research was conducted on male and female observers of various ages, with vitamin A deficiency minimized. The findings could help improve our understanding of how people adapt to low-light conditions and inform the development of treatments for vision-related issues.
