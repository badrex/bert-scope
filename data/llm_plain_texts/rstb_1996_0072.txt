tldr: This study examines the genetic distance between two species of island land snails, Partula taeniata and Partula suturalis, on the island of Moorea in French Polynesia. The genetic distance varies clinally from north to south, with the southern species showing a greater difference due to an invasion from the neighboring island of Tahiti. The genetic closeness in the north, despite large morphological and ecological differences, is attributed to "molecular leakage," which can mislead us about speciation. Rates of hybridization as low as 1 in 100,000 can render two species nearly homogeneous in their gene frequencies over periods of time that are short on an evolutionary scale.
