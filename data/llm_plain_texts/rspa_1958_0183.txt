tldr: This article presents a nonlinear theory of strong interactions between mesons, nucleons, and hyperons. The theory introduces a four-component field vector of constant length in an isotopic spin space, generating the mass of the meson field. The author suggests that this theory could lead to a unified theory based on the meson field alone, potentially unifying the understanding of particle interactions.
