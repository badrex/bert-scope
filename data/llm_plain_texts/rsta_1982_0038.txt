tldr: This article compares foreland and rift margin sedimentary basins based on their tectonic setting, reasons for subsidence, and large-scale geophysical and geological characteristics. It explains how the thermal and mechanical properties of the underlying lithosphere are crucial in the formation of these basins. The article discusses the differences in subsidence mechanisms between foreland and rift margin basins and outlines the geological and geophysical evidence needed to test theoretical models of their evolution. It also presents two archetypal models for tectonic subsidence and compares their predicted characteristics.
