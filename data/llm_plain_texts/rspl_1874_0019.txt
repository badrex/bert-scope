tldr: The author conducted experiments using a sphygmograph to study the circulation of blood and the relationship between pulse rate, cardiac and arterial systoles. They discovered that the length of the interval between the primary and dicrotic rises in the arteries varies with the pulse rate, and they proposed a formula to calculate this relationship. The author also found that the length of the syspasis, the time during which the ventricles raise the pressure of the contained blood, varies with the pulse rate and decreases with an increase in pulse rate.
