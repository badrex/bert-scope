tldr: The author investigates the motion of a free rigid body using an ellipsoid representation. They demonstrate that a material ellipsoid can be used to model the motion of a rigid body rolling on a rough plane. The author also explores the pressure and friction between the ellipsoid and the plane, providing expressions for these forces in terms of the angular velocity and the length of the ellipsoid's axes.
