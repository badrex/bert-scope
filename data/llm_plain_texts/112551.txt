tldr: This article is a supplementary memoir to the author's previous work on skew surfaces, also known as scrolls. It explores the theory of quartic scrolls with a directrix skew cubic and a triple directrix line. The author develops a theory of the reciprocal relations of these scrolls, which has interesting analytical features. The paragraphs in this memoir are numbered consecutively with the previous memoir.
