tldr: This article discusses the compatibility of Maxwell's theorem on the equal partition of energy among the degrees of freedom of atoms with the internal movements exhibited by the spectra of gases. The author, Professor G. F. Fitzgerald, addresses the common belief that sufficient internal atomic motion to explain gas spectra disproves the energy partition theorem. He presents considerations that show this belief to be incorrect and explains why the proof given by Maxwell, Boltzmann, and others does not fail in this case.
