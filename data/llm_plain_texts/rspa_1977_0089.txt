tldr: This article investigates the impact of different meteorological conditions on the efficiency of solar cells. The authors develop a model that incorporates surface recombination, surface region electric field, and series resistance to analyze the effects of various weather conditions on solar cell outputs. They find that the optimal material for solar cells in the UK is slightly different from silicon, but its practical application is not considered in this study.
