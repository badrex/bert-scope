tldr: 'John Brown conducted experiments to determine the quantity of resin in the Cortex Eleutheriae. He compared two methods of extraction, using spirit of wine and water, and found that the medium between them yielded only three drachms and a quarter of resin. This result contradicted Monsieur Boulduc's claim that ten drachms could be obtained from one ounce of bark.'
