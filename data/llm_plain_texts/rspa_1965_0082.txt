tldr: The authors studied the electron spin resonance spectra of ortho, meta, and para fluoronitrobenzene anions and found large linewidth variations. They analyzed the dominant relaxation term involving the inner product of the fluorine and nitrogen anisotropic hyperfine interaction tensors and provided an expression for the linewidth based on the time variation of the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix. This research helps in understanding the behavior of radicals in solution and the influence of anisotropy in hyperfine tensors on linewidths.
