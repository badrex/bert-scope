tldr: The study investigates the properties of malate dehydrogenase in the halophytic plant Suaeda maritima, which has a high salt tolerance. The researchers found that the enzyme activity in the plant is stimulated by sodium chloride, and the degree of stimulation increases with higher substrate concentrations. The results contribute to understanding the mechanism of salt tolerance in halophytes.
