tldr: The author proposes a model for the function of photosystem II in oxygen evolution and variable chlorophyll fluorescence. The model involves a symmetrical structure with pheophytin redox chemistry on both the acceptor and donor side, which helps achieve high redox potentials necessary for water oxidation. This structure also explains the phenomenon of variable chlorophyll fluorescence and the efficient dissipation of surplus energy in the reaction center.
