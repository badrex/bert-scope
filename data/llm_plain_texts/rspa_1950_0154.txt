tldr: The authors present a theoretical analysis of the motion of non-conducting charged spheres in a symmetrical electrolyte under an applied electric field. They derive a formula for the cataphoretic velocity and provide a method for calculating the coefficients of the series. The study helps improve our understanding of electrokinetic phenomena and cataphoresis.
