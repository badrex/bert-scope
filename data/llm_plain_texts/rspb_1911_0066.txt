tldr: The author discovers a new coral species, Ceratopora nicholsonii, with unique features and a distinct structure. The coral has a mushroom-shaped cap with small, short vertical tubes and long, slender tuberculate spicules embedded in its walls. This discovery sheds light on the classification and formation of coral skeletons, and suggests that Ceratopora is an Alcyonarian coral rather than related to Heteropora or Polyzoa.
