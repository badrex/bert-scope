tldr: In this article, Charles Babbage investigates the relationship between electrical and magnetic rotations. He explains the influence of time on certain magnetic phenomena and applies this understanding to the experiments of Mr. Barlow and M. Arago. Babbage also explores the connection between electricity and magnetism, demonstrating that electricity can cause a needle to rotate when placed near a rotating glass disc. This work contributes to the understanding of the fundamental principles of electromagnetism.
