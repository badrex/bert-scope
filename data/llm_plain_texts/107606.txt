tldr: The author, G. Dollond, describes a new design for a micrometer using rock crystal. The crystal acts as a lens in the eye tube of a telescope, allowing for precise micrometrical measurements without the need for complex adjustments. This innovation simplifies the process of using rock crystal in telescopes and offers advantages in terms of accuracy and ease of use.
