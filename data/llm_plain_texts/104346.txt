tldr: 'The author conducted various experiments to study the conductivity of electricity in different materials and the influence of moisture on electrical phenomena. They discovered that the quality of a material, rather than its quantity of matter, determines its ability to receive and conduct electricity. The presence of moisture in the air or on the materials can affect the conductivity of electricity, as demonstrated through experiments with glass tubes, iron bars, and water jets.'
