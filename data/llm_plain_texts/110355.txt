tldr: In March 1833, the Earl of Darnley observed a luminous appearance in the sky over Ireland. The phenomenon, which resembled a stream of light flowing from east to west, was not accompanied by the usual flashes of an Aurora. Stars of the second and third magnitudes were visible through the arch, and the phenomenon lasted for about twenty minutes before disappearing. Similar sightings were reported in other locations with similar timings.
