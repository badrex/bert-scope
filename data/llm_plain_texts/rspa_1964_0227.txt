tldr: The authors propose a new theory of gravitation that treats mass as a direct particle field, arising from all other particles in the universe. This theory, which is equivalent to Einstein's in describing macroscopic phenomena, offers a new perspective on the relationship between gravitation and electromagnetism and has implications for cosmology and particle physics.
