tldr: This article discusses the diurnal variations of wind and barometric pressure at Bombay, focusing on the relationship between the wind and the double diurnal oscillation of the barometer. The author analyzes hourly tabulations from an anemograph, barometer readings, and temperature data from June 1867 to May 1870. The study reveals a connection between the wind and barometric pressure, with the wind's movement being influenced by land and sea breezes. The author also introduces the concept of the longitudinal and meridional diurnal variations of the wind, which are related to the north-south and east-west movements of the wind.
