tldr: The authors discuss the complex place names of Aldabra Atoll, which is under the administration of English-speaking people but has many French-derived names. They provide a map of the atoll with accepted place names and explain the challenges of localizing information due to the lack of prominent features. The authors also suggest improvements for the coordinate grid system used on the island.
