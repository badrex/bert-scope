tldr: This article presents a comprehensive study of the multiple scattering of waves in irregular media, such as radio waves in the interplanetary medium, sound waves in the atmosphere, or ocean waves. The author develops a system of equations to calculate the mean co-phased and quadrature scattered powers and the unnormalized correlation coefficient of the scattered power. The article provides analytical and numerical solutions for specific cases and discusses the probability distributions of amplitude and phase fluctuations of the wave field in the medium.
