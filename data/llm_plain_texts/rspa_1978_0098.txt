tldr: The author presents three methods to measure the dynamic surface tension of liquids using the growth rates of axisymmetric disturbances on excited capillary jets and the oscillation frequency of drops issued from such jets. The first two methods were used to determine the dynamic surface tension of water with better than 1% accuracy in surfaces of less than 1 ms age. The research aims to find new methods for measuring dynamic surface tension that use circular orifices and provide information on surfaces of younger ages.
