tldr: The authors present a unified approach to representing various seismic sources in seismology. They use the Navier equation and Green's dyadic to derive displacement fields for different types of sources, such as double forces, centers of compression, double couples, and centers of rotation. This representation can be applied to study the effects of earthquake sources on the Earth, including free oscillations, surface waves, and residual static deformations.
