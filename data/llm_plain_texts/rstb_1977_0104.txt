tldr: 'The article presents an analysis of oxygen isotope measurements in over 60 deep-sea sediment cores from various regions, focusing on the Late Pleistocene period. The data provides a detailed record of the advance and retreat of ice masses in the northern hemisphere, allowing for the study of ice-sheet dynamics and glacial history. The oxygen isotope record also serves as a valuable tool for understanding glacio-eustatic sea-level changes during the Last Cold Stage.'
