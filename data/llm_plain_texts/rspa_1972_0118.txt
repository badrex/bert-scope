tldr: The authors studied the interactions between ethylene and supported chromium oxide catalysts using infrared spectroscopy. They found that ethylene chemisorbs onto the catalyst surface and that the adsorption of ethylene as ethyl groups constitutes the initiation step in the polymerization reaction. The catalyst's activity is affected by the presence of adsorbed oxidation products, which can be desorbed by evacuation at high temperatures.
