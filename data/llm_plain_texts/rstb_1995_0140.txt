tldr: 'The article discusses the genetic framework for the ethylene response pathway in Arabidopsis seedlings. The authors identify eight mutant loci that have an ethylene-insensitive phenotype and analyze their epistatic interactions. They propose a model for the genetic pathway of ethylene signal transduction, which includes the roles of ETR1, EIN4, and CTR1 genes in controlling seedling stress response to ethylene.'
