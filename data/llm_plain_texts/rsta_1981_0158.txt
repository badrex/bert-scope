tldr: This article presents a formal derivation of sink strengths used in point defect rate theory and discusses various models for evaluating these parameters. The effective medium approach is considered the best method for steady-state problems, and sink strengths for voids, dislocations, dislocation loops, and grain boundaries are analyzed. The article also addresses criticisms of the effective medium method and provides a comprehensive review of the subject.
