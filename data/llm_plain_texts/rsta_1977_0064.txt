tldr: The article discusses the lunar cratering history and the formation of light plains on the Moon. The authors analyze the size-frequency distribution of impact craters and review the latest ideas on lunar cratering chronology. They conclude that most cratering arguments speak against an extraordinary high flux increase (cataclysm) at 4 Ga ago. The study supports the idea of a more continuous decrease in cratering rate over time and against a cataclysmic upward fluctuation in cratering rate around 4 Ga ago. The authors also suggest that part of the light plains was formed by endogenic processes, not by exogenic ejecta deposition.
