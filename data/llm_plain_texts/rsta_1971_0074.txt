tldr: The article discusses the observations of magnesium II emission in late-type stars using the Orbiting Astronomical Observatory OAO-2. The authors analyze the ultraviolet spectra of various stars and find that the outer atmospheres of these stars resemble the solar atmosphere. They also compare the magnesium II emission with the calcium II emission in these stars and discuss the possible mechanisms behind the emission.
