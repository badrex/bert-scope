tldr: The author examines the sensory nerve endings and structure of the muscle spindle in the frog using electron microscopy. They found that the sensory nerve contacts form close connections with the intrafusal muscle fibers, with two distinct types of zones: compact zones at either end and a reticular zone in the center. The study provides insights into the initiation of sensory impulses and the mechanisms of muscular reflex control in animals.
