tldr: The author describes a new method to determine osmotic pressure using a semi-permeable membrane. They explain the mechanism of the semi-permeable membrane and demonstrate the process through an experiment with a sugar solution, ether, and water. The method allows for a wider range of substances to be tested for osmotic pressures, as it requires less exacting conditions for the working material.
