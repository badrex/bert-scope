tldr: This study investigates the sympathetic innervation of the vagina in various species, including the rabbit, cat, guinea-pig, and rat. The research shows that the sympathetic nerve supply to the vagina is predominantly motor in quality, regardless of whether it is motor or inhibitor to the uterus. This finding suggests that efferent sympathetic impulses may cause vaginal contraction during coitus, which would be impossible if the sympathetic were inhibitor.
