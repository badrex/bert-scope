reversed the photogenic effect, rendering the plate repellant to mercurial vapour. This phenomenon was further confirmed by exposing the plate to the action of light transmitted through red, orange, and yellow glasses. The results of these experiments led the author to conclude that the continuing action attributed to the red, orange, and yellow rays by Becquerel and others was not applicable to the Daguerreotype process, as it did not relate to the property of attracting mercurial vapour. The author's findings suggest that the two photogenic actions, resulting from different principles, produce similar effects on the iodide, bromide, or chloride of silver but have opposite effects on the silver plate, endowing it with a property of either attracting or repelling mercurial vapour.

tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effect of red, orange, and yellow rays on the photographic process. They discovered that these rays reverse the photogenic effect, rendering the plate repellant to mercurial vapour. This finding challenges the continuing action attributed to these rays by previous researchers and sheds light on the differences between the photogenic actions on photogenic papers and the Daguerreotype plate.
