tldr: The author, Thomas Knight, explores the mathematical principles behind the attraction of solids with plane surfaces. He focuses on triangles, right-angled triangles, and other plane geometries, providing formulas for calculating the attraction of these shapes on a given point. This work contributes to the understanding of gravitational attraction and the mathematical modeling of solid shapes.
