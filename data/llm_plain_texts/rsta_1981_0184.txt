tldr: This article presents laboratory experiments on circulation and fronts in continental shelf seas. The authors use a rotating fluid layer with a lateral temperature gradient to model lateral density gradients in shallow seas. They observe the formation of gyres, fronts, and density currents, and discuss their implications for real ocean conditions, particularly in polar regions and near river mouths.
