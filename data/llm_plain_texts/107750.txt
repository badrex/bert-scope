tldr: The author examines the remains of the Irish elk found in peat bogs and concludes that they are of comparatively recent origin. The elk may have sought refuge in swampy areas, which could explain their frequent discovery in such locations. The author also discusses the discovery of shells in the marl beneath the peat, which are identified as fresh water species, further supporting the recent origin of the elk remains.
