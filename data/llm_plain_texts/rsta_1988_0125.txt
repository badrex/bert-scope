tldr: The authors studied volcanic rocks from the 1985 Tibet Geotraverse to understand the geological evolution of the Tibetan Plateau. They identified various tectonic environments and provinces, providing insights into the region's past and present geological history. The findings contribute to the understanding of the India-Eurasia continent-continent collision event and the evolution of the Tibetan Plateau.
