tldr: The authors conducted experiments in which they transplanted testes from male chicks into female brown leghorn hens. They observed changes in the hens' combs, spur growth, plumage, sexual maturity, and fertility. The results showed that the testes grafts could cause profound modifications in the hens' primary and secondary sex characteristics, indicating the potential influence of hormones on these traits.
