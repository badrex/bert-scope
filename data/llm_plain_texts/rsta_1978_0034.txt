tldr: This article examines two hypotheses for intra-plate volcanism: the mantle plume hypothesis and the lithospheric fracture hypothesis. The mantle plume hypothesis suggests that convective plumes beneath rigid plates could be the result of turbulent thermal convection within the upper mantle, while the lithospheric fracture hypothesis proposes that magmas flow to the surface through lithospheric fractures. The author discusses the challenges and successes of each hypothesis in explaining the direction and velocity of migration of intra-plate volcanism, and examines intra-plate volcanism in Africa and the western United States in terms of these hypotheses.
