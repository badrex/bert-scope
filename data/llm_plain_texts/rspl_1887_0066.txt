tldr: The author discovered that tubercles on the roots of Leguminosae plants are caused by a parasitic fungus. They found the infecting agent and observed its growth inside the root, leading to the formation of tubercles. The fungus multiplies by budding and induces hypertrophy in the root cells. After the tubercles decay, the fungus passes into the soil and infects other roots, potentially playing a significant role in agriculture.
