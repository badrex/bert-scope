tldr: The authors developed a new method to measure osmotic pressures by observing the rate at which water flows into a solution. This method, which they call "dynamic osmotic pressure," is different from the traditional equilibrium method and can be used to measure osmotic pressures in dilute solutions. The authors also found that the rate of water flow under a given hydrostatic pressure is the same as the rate at which it would pass through the membrane when entering a dilute solution with the same osmotic pressure. This method can be used to test the semi-permeability of membranes and has potential applications in the study of diffusion and osmosis.
