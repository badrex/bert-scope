tldr: Tiberius Cavallo describes an improved electrical instrument that can collect and concentrate small or diffused amounts of electricity. The device works by using a tin plate connected to two tin tubes, with glass sticks providing insulation. When connected to an electrometer, the instrument can collect and demonstrate the presence and quality of electricity from various sources, such as the atmosphere, rain, or evaporation. The device's effectiveness is demonstrated through several experiments, showcasing its potential for use in electrical investigations.
