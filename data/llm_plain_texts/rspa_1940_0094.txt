tldr: The authors studied the mutarotation of reducing sugars in solution, which is the interconversion between different sugar forms. They found that the number of atoms involved in the activation process is likely between four and seven. The authors also investigated the temperature dependence of the reaction and provided a detailed analysis of the thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of mutarotation for various sugars. This research helps to better understand the behavior of sugars in solution and their potential applications in various fields.
