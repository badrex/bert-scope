tldr: This study examines the peduncle and olfactory lobes in the squid nervous system. The peduncle lobe processes information from photoreceptors and the statocyst, and its output is mainly to motor areas. The olfactory lobe receives input from the olfactory organ and optic lobe, and its main projection is to the optic gland. Both lobes are part of the basal lobe system and may play a role in regulating motor programs and reproduction.
