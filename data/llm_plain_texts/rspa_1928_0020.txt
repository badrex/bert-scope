tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the polarization state of downcoming wireless waves. They discovered that the waves were approximately circularly polarized with a left-handed rotation. The authors concluded that the circular polarization was caused by the action of the atmosphere, rather than being emitted by the sending station.
