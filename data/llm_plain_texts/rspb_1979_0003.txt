tldr: The soldier beetle eye has a unique structure with large optically isotropic corneal cones that project inward from a thick isotropic cornea. Refraction occurs mainly at the corneal surface, and the first focal plane is near the tip of the cone. The eye has two types of retinula cells, which contribute to the axial rhabdom and two rounded rhabdoms. Intracellular recording reveals three spectral types of retinula cells with peaks near 360, 450, and 510 nm. The acceptance angle of these cells is consistent with their anatomical type, suggesting that only one anatomical type has been sampled.
