tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the total ionization produced in various gases by cathode rays ejected by X-rays. They found that the total ionization is practically independent of the pressure in gases with no atoms heavier than oxygen, while it increases with pressure in gases containing atoms heavier than oxygen. The results suggest that the energy liberated in the form of soft X-rays is of the same order as that liberated in the form of cathode rays.
