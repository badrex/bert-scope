tldr: This article explores the theoretical and numerical structure of unstable detonations, focusing on one-dimensional detonations as a testing ground for more complex phenomena in multiple dimensions. The authors discuss the linear and nonlinear theories of unstable detonations, as well as the interaction of asymptotic and numerical methods in predicting detonation instability. They also highlight the importance of understanding unstable detonations for improving numerical methods and developing better models for real-world applications.
