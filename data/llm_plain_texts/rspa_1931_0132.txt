  - Distance measurement
  - de Sitter space
  - Spectral lines
tldr: The author develops a method to define spatial distance in curved space-time, focusing on the de Sitter world. This concept is crucial for understanding the displacement of spectral lines of distant sources and the calculation of distances in expanding universes.
