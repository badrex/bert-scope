tldr: The authors conducted a genetic analysis of a sex-limited character in Drosophila melanogaster, focusing on the coloration of the palps. They found that the character is controlled by multiple genes and is limited to females. The study provides insights into the evolution of secondary sexual characteristics and the role of genetic selection in shaping them.
