tldr: This study investigates the stability and breakup of charged droplets using an electrodynamic levitator. The researchers found that droplets break when the electric stress exceeds the surface tension, and the fraction of volume and charge lost is independent of particle size and charge sign. The results are compared with Rayleigh's theory and show excellent agreement, confirming the Rayleigh limit for both oil and acid droplets.
