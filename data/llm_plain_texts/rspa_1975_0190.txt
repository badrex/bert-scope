tldr: The authors studied the KI absorption spectrum in the vacuum ultraviolet range and discovered at least 140 new features. They used Hartree-Fock calculations to interpret the spectrum and found that all observed features can be attributed to excitation of the 3p-subshell. This research helps improve our understanding of the KI spectrum and its potential applications.
