tldr: The author investigates the origin of bacteria and toruloid vegetations, concluding that they mostly originate from invisible germs floating in the surrounding air and water. The panspermic theory is confirmed, but the author suggests that there might be rare cases of abiogenic origin. The experiments involve sterilization by heat and the examination of various organic liquids and tissues.
