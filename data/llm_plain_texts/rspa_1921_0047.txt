tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the molecular structure and properties of thin films of palmitic acid on water. They measured the mechanical properties of the films and found that the molecules of the fatty acids attach to the water by their carboxyl groups, resulting in an orientation with the molecules perpendicular to the surface. The study provides valuable information about the force fields around individual molecules, which is crucial to understanding various chemical and physical phenomena.
