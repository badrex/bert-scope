tldr: The author examines the homologies and succession of teeth in dasyurid marsupials, focusing on the evolution of mammalian teeth in general. They propose a theory on the evolution and succession of teeth applicable to the Mammalia in general, bridging the gap between Metatheria and Eutheria. The study reveals that the original typical number of premolars in mammals was four, and the missing premolar in Phascologale and other Marsupials is identified, providing insights into the homologies of teeth in these species.
