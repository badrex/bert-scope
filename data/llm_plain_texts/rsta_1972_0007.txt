tldr: This article discusses geophysical studies related to the Tertiary volcanic structure of the British Isles. It examines gravity and magnetic survey results over Scottish Tertiary districts, revealing step, linear, and circular anomalies related to faulted basalts, dykes, and intrusive centers. The authors also explore the deep crustal structure and discuss the significance of anomalous magnetic time variations and enhanced heat flow in the region.
