tldr: The authors developed numerical models to study the interaction between tides and storm surges in the Bay of Bengal. They simulated the effects of a tropical cyclone on the Orissa coast of India and the Andhra coast of India, comparing model predictions to available tide-gauge data. The study highlights the importance of accurate wind data and forecasting for operational use of these models in predicting and managing coastal flooding and inundation.
