tldr: In this article, Isaac Newton provides detailed instructions for conducting experiments on the behavior of colors using prisms. He explains the correct positioning of the prism and the importance of using a clear day and a small hole to achieve the desired results. Newton also addresses criticisms from his contemporaries and invites them to try the experiments themselves to verify the findings.
