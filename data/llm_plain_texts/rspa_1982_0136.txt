tldr: This article discusses the symmetry groups of regular tessellations of S and their representations. The author describes the construction of these symmetry groups for regular complexes that tessellate S and presents their presentations and subgroups of products of the binary polyhedral groups. The article also provides character tables for the symmetry groups relevant to this work.
