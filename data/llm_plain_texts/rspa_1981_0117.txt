tldr: Cork has unique properties that make it an excellent insulator for heat and sound, as well as a shock-absorbing material for flooring and packaging. The structure of cork is composed of small cells with corrugated walls that bend and buckle when loaded, providing large energy absorption. The author investigates the structure of cork and measures its mechanical characteristics, which can be explained in terms of cell-wall deformation.
