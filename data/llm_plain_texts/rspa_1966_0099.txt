tldr: The authors studied the photochemistry of aqueous solutions of Fe(II) and found that photoelectron detachment occurs from ferrous and ferrocyanide ions. They used nitrous oxide as a specific scavenger of aquated electrons and discovered that hydrogen and nitrogen are produced in the process. This research provides insights into the photochemical reactions of ferrous and ferrocyanide ions in aqueous solutions.
