tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the fluid flow resulting from the impact of water drops on unyielding dry surfaces. They found that the primary influence of surface roughness is the determination of the condition for the ejection of secondary droplets by exciting an instability in the developing watersheet. The authors also discovered that the initial normalized watersheet velocity is around 6, and the ejected material's normalized velocity is about 20% greater than the watersheet substrate's velocity.
