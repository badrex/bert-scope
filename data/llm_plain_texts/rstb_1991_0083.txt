tldr: This article discusses the preservation of chlorophyll-derived pigments in sedimentary organic matter, providing evidence for primary photosynthetic communities in ancient water columns. The study examines the structures of various components, revealing that chlorophyll carbon skeletons can survive intact or with minor modifications. The findings can provide information about the productivity and preservation of organic matter and the presence of water column anoxia at the time of deposition.
