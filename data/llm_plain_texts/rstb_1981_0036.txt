revised_title: 'Biometrical Genetics in Plant Breeding: Understanding the Genetic Framework'
semantic_tags:
  - Plant breeding
  - Biometrical genetics
  - Heterosis
  - Genetic variation
  - Recombinant inbred lines
tldr: The article discusses the use of biometrical genetics as a methodology to understand the genetic framework of plant breeding. It explains how biometrical genetics allows for the analysis of heritable and non-heritable components of variation, and how this information can be used to predict the outcome of breeding and selection programs. The article also explores the causes of heterosis and the range of phenotypic distributions of recombinant inbred lines.
