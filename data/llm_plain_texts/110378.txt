tldr: In this research, Michael Faraday investigates the nature of electro-chemical decomposition. He demonstrates that the effect does not depend on the simultaneous action of two metallic plates, as a single pole can be used to cause decomposition. Faraday also explores the influence of water in electro-chemical decomposition, showing that water is just one of many bodies that can conduct electric influence and effect decomposition.
