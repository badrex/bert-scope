tldr: The author examines the anatomical connections and evolutionary relationships between the vomer, ethmoid, and intermaxillary bones in mammals. They describe the unique features of these bones in humans and discuss their development in early life. The author also explores the connections between these bones in various mammal families and compares them to those in birds, reptiles, and fishes. This study contributes to our understanding of skull anatomy and vertebrate evolution.
