revised_title: Terrestrial Gas Emissions and Their Impact on Tropospheric Chemistry
semantic_tags:
  - Air chemistry

  - Trace gases
  - Terrestrial emissions
  - Atmospheric pollution
tldr: This article discusses the exchange of trace gases between land and the atmosphere, focusing on the roles of methane, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, and isoprene in controlling the fast photochemical balance and oxidizing capacity of the troposphere. The authors highlight the importance of terrestrial gas emissions in controlling the distribution of hydroxyl radicals, which play a central role in cleansing the atmosphere of trace gases emitted by terrestrial processes and human activities.
