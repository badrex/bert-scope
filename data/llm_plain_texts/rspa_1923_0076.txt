tldr: This article discusses the methods and results of an investigation into the heat and gases produced when high explosives are detonated under standard conditions of confinement and compression. The authors developed a calorimetric bomb and a detonator to measure the heat of detonation and analyze the gases produced. They found that the heat of detonation varies greatly with changes in conditions, and the composition of the gases depends on the density of the explosive and the type of detonator used.
