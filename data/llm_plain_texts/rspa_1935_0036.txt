tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the efficiency of detonators and the behavior of shock waves in the vicinity of detonators. They used various types of detonators and explosives, and measured the maximum effective gap lengths for detonation. The results showed that detonator efficiency and shock wave behavior are directional, and the authors discussed possible explanations for these findings.
