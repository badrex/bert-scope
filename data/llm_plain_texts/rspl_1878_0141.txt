tldr: The authors, William Henry Preece and Augustus Stroh, conducted studies on sonorous vibrations and speech reproduction, focusing on vowel sounds. They developed a new phonautograph that records both air pressure and sonorous vibrations, and created the "synthetic curve machine" to represent and vary each partial in phase and amplitude, contributing to a better understanding of vowel sounds and their variations in different dialects.
