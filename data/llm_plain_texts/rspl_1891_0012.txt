tldr: This article investigates the impact of temperature on the magnetization of iron and other magnetic substances. The author found that the magnetic power of iron decreases with increasing temperature, and that the magnetic properties of iron and steel suggest that weak magnetizing forces only penetrate a small depth below the surface when cold, but can reach deeper layers with increasing temperature.
