tldr: The inelastic scattering of very slow neutrons by aluminium has been measured at four temperatures between 90 and 700 K. The results are compared with theory and found to agree within 10%. The study provides insights into the behavior of neutrons and their interactions with materials, which is essential for understanding nuclear reactions and material properties.
