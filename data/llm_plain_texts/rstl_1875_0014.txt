tldr: The author presents a method to determine the coefficients of the expression for each separate periodical phenomenon when observing the combined effect of several independent phenomena. The method involves finding the least integral numbers proportional to the periods of the phenomena and using Bessel's process to determine the coefficients from the observations.
