tldr: Walter Gardiner was a notable botanist who made significant contributions to the understanding of plant cell histology and protoplasmic continuity. He demonstrated the existence of protoplasmic connections between plant cells through delicate filaments, which helped to establish the concept of the continuity of protoplasm. Gardiner's work laid the foundation for further research in plant cell communication and cell wall structure.
