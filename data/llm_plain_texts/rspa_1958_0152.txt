tldr: The article discusses the experimental situation in B-decay, focusing on the discovery of parity non-conservation. The author summarizes various experiments, including electron polarization, nuclear polarization, and circular polarization, which provide evidence for the breakdown of parity conservation in B-decay. The results are analyzed within the framework of the two-state neutrino theory of Lee and Yang.
