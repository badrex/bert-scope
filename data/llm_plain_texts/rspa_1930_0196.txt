semantic_tags:
  - Infrared spectroscopy
  - Sulphur dioxide
  - Molecular structure
  - Vibrational bands
  - Moments of inertia
tldr: 'The authors investigated the infra-red spectrum of sulphur dioxide and discovered its molecular structure, moments of inertia, and vibrational bands. They found that the molecule has three distinct fundamental frequencies and a triangular structure. The study helps in understanding the optical absorption in the infra-red region and the orientation of the vibrating electric doublet.'
