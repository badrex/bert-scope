tldr: The authors studied the uptake of (35S) sulphate by granulation tissue in regenerating tendons of guinea pigs. They found that the maximum uptake occurred after the seventh day and was maintained for at least 8 more days. In scurvy, the uptake of 35S was lower than in healthy controls, indicating that the total amount of polysaccharide in scorbutic granulation tissue was not sulphated in the normal way. The study also showed that sulphate uptake by granulation tissue was dependent on an enzymatic reaction, possibly involving oxidative phosphorylation.
