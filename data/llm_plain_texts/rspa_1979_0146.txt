tldr: This article investigates the structure of turbulent jets, focusing on the vortex street and its effects on the flow. The authors find that the vortex structure influences the fluctuations in the potential core, entrainment region, and mixing region of the jet. They also discover that the vortices' trajectory, convection velocity, and size play a significant role in the jet's behavior. The study confirms the appropriateness of Strouhal number scaling for the jet data, suggesting that the structure is valid up to sonic speed.
