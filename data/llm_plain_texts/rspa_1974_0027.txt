tldr: This study compares the adsorption and boundary lubrication properties of long-chain fatty amines on stainless steel. The results show that adsorption and lubricant failure depend on the concentration of amines and temperature in a similar way. The findings suggest that breakdown of lubrication may be associated with desorption of amines from steel surfaces. The study also demonstrates the influence of chain length on adsorption properties and its effect on lubrication performance.
