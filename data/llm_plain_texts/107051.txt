tldr: The author, Nathaniel Hulme, conducted experiments on the spontaneous light emitted by various substances, such as marine animals, insects, and rotten wood. He discovered that the quantity of light emitted is not directly related to the degree of putrefaction and that the light-emitting substance can be separated and retained for some time. Hulme also observed that the light is a constituent principle of some bodies, like marine fishes, and can be extracted using specific chemical processes.
