tldr: The author discusses in vitro models for photosynthesis, focusing on the light harvesting mechanisms and antenna efficiency. They describe the processes of photosystem II, including light harvesting, electron transfer, and water oxidation. The author also presents recent progress in kinetic studies and energy transfer in the antenna, using examples from porphyridium cruentum and phycobilisomes.
