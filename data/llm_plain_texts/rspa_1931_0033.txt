tldr: This article investigates the explosions of mixtures of acetylene and electrolytic gas, focusing on the flame speeds and luminosity. The authors found that the initial flame speeds and luminosity progressively diminished with each addition of acetylene. The highest speeds were observed with mixtures containing between 8-11.8% of acetylene. Carbon deposition was observed when the acetylene content exceeded 25%. The findings provide insights into the combustion process and the behavior of gas explosions.
