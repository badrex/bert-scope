tldr: The authors conducted experiments on parasitic hymenoptera larvae to study their respiration mechanisms. They discovered that the general body surface of these larvae acts as a respiratory surface, and the problem of respiration in apneustic aquatic and parasitic larvae is essentially the same. The study used chemical and biological indicators to determine the relative rates of gaseous exchange in different parts of the body surface, providing insights into the respiration mechanisms of these parasites.
