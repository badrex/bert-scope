tldr: The authors study the behavior of N-shaped waves, specifically leading-depression and leading-elevation waves, in the context of tsunami run-up on sloping beaches. They use the shallow-water wave equations to derive asymptotic results for the maximum run-up and find that leading-depression waves can run-up higher than leading-elevation waves. This challenges the traditional solitary wave model for predicting run-up limits in near-shore generated tsunamis.
