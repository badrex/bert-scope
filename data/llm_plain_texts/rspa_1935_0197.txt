tldr: The authors investigated the combustion of hydrocarbons, focusing on the absorption spectra and chemical properties of intermediates. They studied various compounds and their reactions, discovering that some compounds, like formaldehyde and organic acids, have a large enough absorption coefficient to be detected during combustion. The authors also found a new absorption band in the slow combustion of higher hydrocarbons, which they aimed to further investigate.
