tldr: This study investigates the impact of venous pressure, arterial pressure, and pulse rate on the work done by the heart. The researchers found that increasing venous pressure led to more blood being pumped out from the left ventricle, while changes in arterial pressure had little effect. They also discovered that a slower heart rate resulted in more blood being pumped out at each beat, and the total work done by the heart increased with a faster heart rate.
