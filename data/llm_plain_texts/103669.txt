tldr: The author, John Douglas, proposes a new surgical method to help patients with bladder stones who cannot undergo traditional surgeries. He suggests creating an artificial fistula in the perineum to allow patients to pass a probe to push the stone back or to inject cleansing liquids. This method can also help prevent the growth of new stones and alleviate pain. Douglas believes that this approach can be further improved by dilating the fistula to allow the use of forceps to extract the stone gradually.
