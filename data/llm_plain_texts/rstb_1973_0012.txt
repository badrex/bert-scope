tldr: This article discusses the mechanisms of action of neurotransmitters in vertebrate smooth muscle, focusing on electrical changes underlying excitation and inhibition in intestinal and related smooth muscle. The authors explore the effects of parasympathetic and sympathetic nerve activity on smooth muscle, as well as the role of intrinsic inhibitory and excitatory neurons in intrinsic reflex arcs.
