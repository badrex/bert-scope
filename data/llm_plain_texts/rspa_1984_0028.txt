tldr: The study investigates the changes in the core structure of a screw dislocation in a body-centered cubic lattice when subjected to a general applied stress tensor. The research finds that the core structure is primarily determined by the magnitude and orientation of the induced glide strain, with a smaller dependence on the glide stress. This explains the dependence of the Peierls stress on non-glide components of the applied stress tensor and has implications for the phenomenon of ductile fracture.
