tldr: The authors conducted experiments to verify the two-dimensional van der Waals equation of state for adsorption on a homotattic substrate. They found that adsorption isotherms of carbon, chloroform, and fluorotrichloromethane on graphitized carbon can be accurately described by the equation both above and below the critical temperature. This study provides evidence for the polarization of adsorbate molecules by an electric field present at the graphite surface.
