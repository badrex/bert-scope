tldr: The authors investigate the crystal structure of tridymite, a form of silica, and compare it to quartz and cristobalite. They use X-ray analysis to determine the arrangement of silicon and oxygen atoms in tridymite, finding that it has a unique structure distinct from quartz and cristobalite. This research contributes to the understanding of silica polymorphism and its various applications in industries such as glass and clay.
