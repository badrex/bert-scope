tldr: In October 1694, a violent storm caused significant changes to river courses in the region between Virginia and New-Castle in Pennsylvania. The storm altered the flow of water, creating new channels and stopping the flow of others. This event was documented by Mr. Scarburgh and communicated by Sir Robert Southwell to the Royal Society.
