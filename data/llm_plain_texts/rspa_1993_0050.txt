tldr: This study investigates the indentation creep of power law solids, providing a rigorous theoretical analysis of the stress, strain, and displacement fields under a rigid punch. The research considers axisymmetric and plane indenters and offers methods to calculate the load on the indenter and contact radius in terms of indentation depth and rate of penetration. The findings are consistent with experimental observations of hardness tests on creeping materials.
