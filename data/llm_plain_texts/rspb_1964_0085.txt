tldr: The article discusses the structure and properties of spermatophores and spermatozoa in the squid Loligo pealii. Spermatophores contain a large number of densely packed spermatozoa and are made up of various layers, including a spiral filament and a cement body. The study found that squid spermatozoa have glycolytic activity and their motility can be extended by adding substrates like glucose, fructose, and sodium pyruvate. This is in contrast to other invertebrates with external fertilization, such as sea-urchins, which lack glycolytic activity.
