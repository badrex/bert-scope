tldr: Researchers altered the amino acid residue Glu-165 to Asp in the triosephosphate isomerase enzyme to study the kinetic consequences. They found that the mutation slowed down the enolization steps by a factor of about one thousand. This study provides insights into enzyme mechanism and the relationship between protein structure and function.
