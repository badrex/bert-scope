tldr: This article investigates proton transfer in hydrogen bonded systems, specifically in tautomeric systems like 2-thiapyrid and 2-pyridone. The authors present evidence that proton transfer occurs in certain types of hydrogen bonds, increasing the association energy. They also study the effect of isotopic substitution on hydrogen bonds and discuss the implications of their findings.
