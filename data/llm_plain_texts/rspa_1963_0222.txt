tldr: The authors measured the wavelengths of thirteen intense lines in the infra-red spectrum of argon using a reflecting echelon interferometer. They compared the measurements with the primary standard line of krypton 86, achieving an accuracy of about 0.001 A. The values of the 3d and 2s levels of argon were determined from the measurements, which were then used to calculate the wavelengths of sixty-seven more infra-red lines in the region between 1 and 2 Âµm.
