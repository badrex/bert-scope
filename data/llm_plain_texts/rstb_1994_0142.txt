tldr: The article analyzes the swimming patterns and locomotion of remipede crustaceans, specifically Speleonectes lucayensis. It describes two swimming patterns: normal metachronal cruising and an ametachronal mode, which may be used to gain speed. The study also discusses the limb morphology, functional analysis of swimming, and the adaptation of remipedes to their cave environment.
