tldr: The authors investigate the crystal field at a rare-earth ion in double nitrates and find that it approximates to one possessing icosahedral symmetry. They use group theory and tensor-operator methods to study the effect of this crystal field on the energy level system of a rare-earth ion, with an application to paramagnetic resonance in dysprosium double nitrate.
