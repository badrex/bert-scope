tldr: 'The authors present a numerical method for solving the equations of steady viscous flow around circular cylinders at low speeds. They use a grid transformation and repeated interpolation to obtain approximate solutions for the flow field, streamlines, and pressure distribution. This method can be applied to other equations and problems in fluid dynamics.'
