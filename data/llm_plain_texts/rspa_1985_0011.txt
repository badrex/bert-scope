revised_title: 'Contact Fatigue Crack Growth Analysis and Asperity Effects'
semantic_tags:
  - Fatigue crack growth
  - Contact loading
  - Stress intensity factors
  - Asperity interactions
  - Inclusions
tldr: This study analyzes the propagation behavior of fatigue cracks caused by contact loading, focusing on stress intensity factors and the influence of asperity interactions and inclusions. The research provides a more comprehensive understanding of contact fatigue and helps explain observed phenomena in experimental studies. The analysis can be extended to include additional factors and more refined models for improved accuracy.
