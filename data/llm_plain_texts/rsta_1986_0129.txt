tldr: The author argues that the mass-to-light ratios of stellar systems, if properly understood, can explain the observed rotation curves of galaxies without the need for dark matter. By examining various examples, the author suggests that the regularity of mass-to-light ratios in different galaxies may be a more plausible explanation than speculations about dark matter.
