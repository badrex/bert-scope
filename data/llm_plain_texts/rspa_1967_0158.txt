tldr: The authors investigated the magneto-optical properties of defect centres in alkali halide crystals, focusing on neutral silver atoms and centres. They used Faraday rotation and circular dichroism techniques to study the electronic states responsible for broad optical absorption bands. The results showed that the spin-orbit coupling constant of the silver atom's excited state is reduced in different alkali halide crystals, indicating a cancellation of spin-orbit interaction due to symmetry allowed admixtures of lattice ion wavefunctions.
