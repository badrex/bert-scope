tldr: The study investigates the effects of ligation of the vasa efferentia on fertility and testicular histology in rats. The results show that rats are fertile for about 21 days after ligation, and significant degeneration of the seminiferous tubules occurs in the testes. The research also discusses potential causes of testicular degeneration and the implications of these findings for future studies on sperm survival and fertility.
