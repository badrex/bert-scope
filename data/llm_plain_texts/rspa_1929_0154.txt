tldr: This article discusses the research on high-frequency fatigue in various materials, such as steel, aluminum, and copper, using innovative apparatus designs. The authors found that the fatigue limit increases with frequency but reaches a maximum value, and in some cases, even decreases at the highest frequencies. They developed new methods to support test pieces and generate high-frequency vibrations, leading to a better understanding of material behavior under high-frequency loading conditions.
