tldr: 'This article explains the importance of neurotrophins and their receptors in the development, maintenance, and injury of sensory neurons, particularly in dorsal root ganglion neurons. The study shows that these neurons require functional neurotrophin receptors for survival during development and that different functional classes of sensory neurons are regulated by different members of the neurotrophin family.'
