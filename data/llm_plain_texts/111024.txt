tldr: The author, James Booth, applies the theory of elliptic functions to study the rotation of a rigid body around a fixed point. He introduces an ellipsoid, whose axes are directly proportional to the moments of inertia of the body, to represent the motion. The paper presents a method of investigation that provides a simple and elegant interpretation of integrals needed to determine the dynamic state of a body at any given time.
