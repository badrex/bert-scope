tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the variation of dielectric constants of some organic liquids with frequency in the range of 1 to 10. They used condensers with two metal surfaces separated by air or the liquid under examination to measure the dielectric constants. The results showed that the dielectric constants of the tested liquids changed with frequency, which is important for understanding their behavior in alternating electric fields.
