tldr: This article investigates the progress of the diurnal inequality wave along the coasts of Europe, focusing on the impact of lunar influences on tides. The author traces the wave's propagation and examines different modes of propagation, ultimately concluding that the diurnal wave travels irregularly and affects both high and low waters at various locations.
