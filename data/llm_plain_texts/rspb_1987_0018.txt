tldr: The study examines the external morphology and sensory systems of the deep-sea fish Acanthonus armatus, which has the smallest brain and largest semicircular canals per unit body weight among known teleosts and possibly any vertebrate. The fish's lateral line and vestibular senses are particularly acute, suggesting it is sensitive to low-frequency sound and well-adapted to its deep-sea environment.
