tldr: The authors conducted a detailed study of the thymus gland, examining its minute anatomy, histology, and function. They discovered that the cortex is the more important part of the thymus follicle, containing two types of retiform tissue. The formation of connective tissue and new vessels occurs mainly through the agency of granular cells, which arise from connective tissue corpuscles. The thymus plays a role in the development of the immune system and the production of blood cells.
