tldr: 'This article examines the regulation of chloroplast development in plants, focusing on transcriptional, translational, and post-translational controls. The authors study the levels of key proteins and their corresponding mRNAs during the de-etiolation of pea seedlings under different light conditions. They find that phytochrome and protochlorophyllide play crucial roles in coordinating chloroplast development, with phytochrome regulating aspects of development in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and chloroplast.'
