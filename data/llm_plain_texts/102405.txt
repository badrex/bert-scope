tldr: The author and his companion traveled to the Swedish North to observe the behavior of the Sun and the Earth's figure. They found that the Sun could be seen all night during the summer solstice, and they made accurate latitude measurements. They also discussed the refraction of light, the frigid zone, and the variation of the compass needle. Their observations challenged the existing maps and theories about the Earth's shape.
