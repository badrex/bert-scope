tldr: 'The author, John Dalton, examines the distribution of gases in the atmosphere based on the atomic theory. He considers the repulsion between gas particles and how gases distribute themselves in a vertical column. Dalton concludes that each gas forms a separate atmospheric column, decreasing in density according to its own law. He also suggests a method to determine the absolute height of a gas atmosphere by testing the upper and lower portions of a tall receiver. Dalton provides a view of the Earth's atmosphere composition based on his findings, considering the heights of oxygen, azote, carbonic acid, and aqueous vapor.'
