tldr: The authors investigated the nucleation and growth processes occurring during the dehydration of certain alums using advanced microscope techniques. They observed that nuclei are usually produced at sites of identifiable surface imperfection and that these sites are not randomly distributed across the reactant surfaces. The rates of interface advance are constant at the boundaries of established nuclei, and the activation energies for the constant rate of interface advance during dehydrations of chrome alum and solid solutions were between 70 and 93, with no systematic dependence on composition discerned. The authors propose a new model for the water elimination reactions proceeding within established dehydration nuclei.
