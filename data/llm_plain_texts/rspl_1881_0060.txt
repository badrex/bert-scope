tldr: The author used spectroscopy to analyze the spectrum of Comet b 1881 and discovered the presence of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen in the comet. The continuous spectrum showed dark lines of Fraunhofer, and the bright lines belonged to the spectrum of carbon, possibly combined with hydrogen. This finding supports previous observations of telescopic comets and provides new insights into the composition of comets.
