tldr: This article explores the possibility of thermal equilibrium between a black hole and a heat bath, following Hawking's discovery of black hole emission. The authors introduce thermal Green functions to discuss this equilibrium and extend the original arguments to include mutual and self-interactions. They also discuss the effect of gravity on the system and the relation between energy, entropy, and temperature in the presence of a black hole.
