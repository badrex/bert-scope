tldr: The author, A. W. Williamson, studied the formation and properties of nitro-glycerine, a compound created by reacting glycerine with a mixture of concentrated nitric and sulfuric acids. He found that nitro-glycerine is heavier than water, slightly soluble in water, and soluble in alcohol and ether. The compound is prone to decomposition, making a complete analysis difficult. Williamson deduced a formula for nitro-glycerine and discovered that it can be decomposed into glycerine and potassium nitrate by boiling with a concentrated solution of potash.
