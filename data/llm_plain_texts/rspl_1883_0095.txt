tldr: The author examines the nature and constitution of chlorophyll, a pigment responsible for the green color of leaves. They investigate the possibility that chlorophyll is a glucoside, a type of organic compound, by analyzing its behavior when exposed to acids. The author finds that chlorophyll decomposes into two substances, phyllocyanin and phyllo-xanthin, when treated with acid, and that it may be accompanied by a glucoside-like substance in the plant cell.
