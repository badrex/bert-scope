tldr: The author proposes a new method for measuring illumination and creating a standard for electric lighting. He suggests using glow lamps introduced by Mr. Swan to measure the illumination of surfaces independent of the light sources. The author also introduces a small Swan glow lamp as a new standard of light, which can be used to replace the standard spermaceti candle. This method allows for more accurate measurements of the light-giving power of various lamps distributed over a room or large area.
