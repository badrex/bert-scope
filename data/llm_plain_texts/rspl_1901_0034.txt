tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine if horse flies could transmit the Trypanosoma Evansi, a parasite responsible for surra in India and Nagana or Tsetse-fly disease in Africa. The study found that horse flies could transmit the parasite when allowed to bite healthy animals immediately after feeding on infected animals. This discovery strengthens the theory that surra and Tsetse-fly disease are caused by closely related parasites.
