revised_title: The Kinetic Theory of Surface Films: Gaseous, Expanded, and Condensed Films

  - Liquid Films
tldr: The authors explore the kinetic theory of surface films, including gaseous, expanded, and condensed films. They find that the kinetic theory is inapplicable for liquid films and suggest that the intramolecular thrust integrated over the film's thickness, or the length of a molecule, is a more suitable explanation for these films.
