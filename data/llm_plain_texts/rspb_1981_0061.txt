tldr: The authors conducted experiments on 352 neurons in area 17 of the cat's visual cortex to study their spatial frequency selectivity. They found that neurons with narrow spatial frequency tuning curves also had narrow orientation tuning curves. Neurons with broad tuning curves were mainly found in lamina IV and its surroundings. The study suggests that linear spatial summation occurs over a constant area of the visual field, regardless of the neuron's optimal spatial frequency.
