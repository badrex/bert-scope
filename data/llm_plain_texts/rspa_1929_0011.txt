tldr: The authors analyzed the spectrum of doubly ionized fluorine (F III) using a vacuum tube containing silicon tetrafluoride. They identified 314 lines in the spectrum and compared it to the spectrum of singly ionized oxygen (O+), which has the same electron structure. The study provides a partial analysis of the F III spectrum and contributes to the understanding of atomic physics and chemistry.
