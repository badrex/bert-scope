tldr: The author, John Kidd, conducted observations on the natural production of saltpetre on the walls of subterranean and other buildings. He found that saltpetre production is most abundant in clear frosty weather and is influenced by the state of the atmosphere. The author also analyzed the stone composition of the laboratory and found that it contains 96% carbonate of lime, with the rest being sand, oxide of iron, ochry clay, and a trace of animal matter.
