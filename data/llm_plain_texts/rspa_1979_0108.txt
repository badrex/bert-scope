revised_title: Gravitational Wave Detectors: Recent Developments in General Relativity
semantic_tags:
  - Gravitational waves
  - General relativity
  - Gravitational wave detectors
  - Space-based experiments
  - Laser interferometry
tldr: This article discusses the development of gravitational wave detectors and the potential for space-based experiments to detect low-frequency waves from supermassive black holes. Earth-based detectors using laser interferometry and resonant bars at low temperatures are also being constructed to search for gravitational waves from supernovae.
