tldr: The authors developed an optical method to measure vapor pressures and discovered an interesting phenomenon of apparent superheating in solid bromine. They found that the vapor pressure of bromine increased rapidly at its melting point, sometimes jumping and falling back before eventually rising steadily. This method could be useful for investigating rapid and delicate changes of vapor pressure at freezing points.
