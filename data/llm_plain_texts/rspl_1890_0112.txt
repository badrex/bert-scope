tldr: The author investigates the causes of new star phenomena and suggests that they are produced by the collision of meteor-swarms. The study includes a detailed analysis of the spectra of comets and new stars, showing a close relationship between them. The author also discusses the spectroscopic observations of three new stars, Nova Coronae, Nova Cygni, and Nova Andromedae, and explains how their spectra can be reproduced by integrating the spectra of meteoritic swarms.
