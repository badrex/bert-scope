tldr: 'The authors use an atom probe microanalysis technique to detect trace elements at the atomic level in materials like nickel and tungsten. They study the spatial distribution of elements in alloys and the segregation of impurities and dopant elements in tungsten wire. This research helps understand the retention of volatile dopant elements during heat treatment of tungsten wire.'
