tldr: This article examines the collective interest in acoustics among the early members of the Royal Society from 1660 to 1680. It explores the influence of Francis Bacon's ideas on the Society's experiments and the connection between music and dynamics in the scientific inquiries of the time. The study highlights the importance of acoustics as a part of the broader field of natural philosophy and the role of the Royal Society in advancing scientific understanding of sound.
