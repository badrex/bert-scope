revised_title: Combinatorics of Hirota D-Operators and Binary Bell Polynomials
semantic_tags:
  - Combinatorics

  - Bell Polynomials
  - Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations
  - Soliton Equations
tldr: The authors present a formula that relates Hirota operators to simple combinatorics, specifically using partition polynomials like Bell polynomials. They show that these polynomials play a role in characterizing bilinearizable equations and can be used to linearize certain Backlund transformations, providing insight into the structure of integrable hierarchies.
