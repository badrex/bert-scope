tldr: The author investigates the atmospheric waves caused by the powerful volcanic eruption of Krakatoa in 1883. They analyze the barometric disturbances recorded in various locations and calculate the velocity of the waves. The study reveals that the waves traveled at different speeds depending on their direction, with the waves moving from west to east being faster than those moving from east to west. The findings provide insight into the behavior of atmospheric waves and their relationship with the Earth's motion.
