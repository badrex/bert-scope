tldr: The article investigates the ultrastructural aspects of early fore-limb bud development in chicks and mice. It examines the interaction between the epiblast and mesoblast, focusing on the apical ectodermal ridge, and provides insights into the ultrastructural changes that occur during limb development. The study uses electron microscopy to analyze the cells of the limb buds at different stages of development, offering a deeper understanding of the complex processes involved in limb formation.
