tldr: This article reviews the geochronology and structural units of late Precambrian formations in eastern central Africa. It discusses the disposition, lithology, and relation to structural environments of several formations and their positions on a map. The article also provides new details of internal trend directions within the mobile belts and the regional distribution of main tectonic units. The available geochronological information is used to date the structural elements.
