tldr: The author presents observations made with a horizontal pendulum in the Antarctic regions, conducted by Mr. Louis Bernacchi. The data collected helps to analyze changes in the vertical, tremors, pulsations, and earthquakes. The author discusses the possible causes of these movements, including tilting, sun heat, and electrical attractions or repulsions. The study also reveals an active seismic region in the Antarctic area, which may indicate a sub-oceanic ridge and the possibility of New Zealand extending southwestward.
