tldr: The authors present a comprehensive study on the theory of elastic rods, starting from the three-dimensional equations of classical continuum mechanics. They discuss the nonlinear and linear theories of elastic rods, focusing on the derivation of constitutive equations for rods of variable cross-section. The study also includes alternative approximations and the relation between the linearized versions of the results and the classical theories of elastic rods.
