tldr: The author examines the locomotion and nervous system of various species of medusae, including their response to injury and the effects of excision of their peripheral tissues. The study reveals the concentration of locomotor centers in the marginal bodies and the sensitivity of medusae tissues to stimulation. The author also discusses the potential for using medusae as a nerve-muscle preparation for experiments in electrotonus.
