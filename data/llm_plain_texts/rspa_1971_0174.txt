tldr: The authors studied the behavior of drops and drop-pairs under strong electrical forces using a numerical model of incompressible potential flow. They investigated the deformation and stability of uncharged drop-pairs and charged drops in an electric field. The results showed that drops deformed and issued liquid jets when subjected to critical electric forces, providing insights into the interaction of drops in electric fields.
