tldr: The author discusses the advances made in understanding the molecular mechanisms of voltage-gated ion channels in the nerve membrane. They focus on the sodium and potassium channels in squid giant axons and the techniques used to study their properties. The author also presents alternative models for the sodium channel, such as the rotating dipole model, and evaluates their validity based on experimental evidence.
