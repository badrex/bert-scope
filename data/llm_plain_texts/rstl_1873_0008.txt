tldr: The author conducted magnetic observations in the Britannia and Conway tubular iron bridges to examine the magnetic action of the iron on a magnetic needle within the tubes. The study aimed to understand the peculiar state of tremor the iron was subjected to due to passing trains and its effect on the induced magnetism. The observations were conducted at various points of the bridges, and the results provided insights into the magnetic properties of the iron structures.
