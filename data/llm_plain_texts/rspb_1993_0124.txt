tldr: The study examines the energetic efficiency and ecological factors influencing the jumping behavior of prosimian primates. It reveals that most primates do not adopt energy-efficient paths until the jump length is close to their maximum capability. The findings suggest that ecological factors, such as time pressure and habitat support density, play a significant role in determining the manner in which primates jump.
