tldr: The author examines the fossil organism Eozoon Canadense, discovered in Canada, and its zoological affinities. They describe its structure, growth patterns, and the process of siliceous infiltration, which preserved the organism's soft body and pseudopodial extensions. Eozoon Canadense is found to be a type of Foraminifera, a group of single-celled organisms with a unique structure and growth patterns. This discovery sheds light on the importance of the Rhizopod type in early geological history and the evolution of life.
