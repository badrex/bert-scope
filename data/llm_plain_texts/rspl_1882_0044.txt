tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the magnetic susceptibility and maximum magnetization of various materials, including soft iron wires, steel wires, and bars of malleable iron, hard-tempered steel, and cast-iron. They found that the intensity of magnetization and magnetic susceptibility varied greatly depending on the type of material and the magnetizing force applied. The results showed that there is a limit to the magnetizability of iron and steel, and that the magnetization of a material can be influenced by the dimensions and the application of stress.
