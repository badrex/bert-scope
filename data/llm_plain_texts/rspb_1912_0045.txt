tldr: Researchers conducted experiments using a heart-lung preparation to study the effects of pancreatic diabetes. They discovered that the pancreas produces a hormone necessary for tissue cells to assimilate and utilize sugar from the blood. This finding supports the idea that pancreatic diabetes is caused by the absence of this hormone, leading to the inability of tissues to use sugar effectively.
