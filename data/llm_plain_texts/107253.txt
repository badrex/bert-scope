tldr: The author, William Sewell, discovered a canal in the medulla spinalis of various quadrupeds, including horses, bullocks, sheep, hogs, and dogs. He found that the canal extended throughout the spinal marrow and was lined with a membrane resembling the tunica arachnoidea. Sewell also proved that the canal facilitated the communication of a limpid fluid between the brain and spinal marrow. This structure had not been previously described in the literature.
