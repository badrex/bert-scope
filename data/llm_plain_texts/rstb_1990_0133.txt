tldr: This article examines the role of horizontal wind convergence in concentrating flying insects, focusing on the mechanisms that might bring about insect concentrations and their application to the operational monitoring of insect populations. The authors discuss the importance of windshift lines, radar evidence, and the relationship between wind convergence and insect concentration. They also explore the potential for improving insect control by seeking out these concentration patterns.
