tldr: The author presents a detailed account of experiments conducted by J. A. Braunio, who discovered the congelation of mercury using artificial cold. The experiments demonstrate the effects of extreme cold on various fluids and the potential impact on thermometers and barometers. The author discusses the process and results of these experiments, including the freezing of mercury within thermometers, and the potential implications for temperature measurement and understanding low-temperature physics.
