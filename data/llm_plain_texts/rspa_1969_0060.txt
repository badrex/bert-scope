tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the absorption cross-section of lead vapour in the vacuum ultraviolet region. They discovered three autoionizing features and determined their line profile parameters. The cross-section at the series limit was found to be low and falls to zero within each autoionizing feature. The study provides insights into the photoionization continuum and the missing autoionization feature in lead vapour.
