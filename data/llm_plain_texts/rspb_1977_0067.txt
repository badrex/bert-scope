tldr: This study investigates the presence of copper and cobalt in various African species of the plant genus Crotalaria. Significant concentrations of these metals were found in several species, primarily in Central Africa's Copperbelt region. The discovery of metal accumulation in these plants can aid further research on their ecology and potential role in mineral exploration.
