tldr: This article explores the implications of quasar spectroscopy on the constancy of certain dimensionless ratios of physics, such as the fine structure constant, electron-proton mass ratio, and gyromagnetic ratio of the proton. The author discusses the limitations on possible variability of these ratios over large look-back times and distances, using data from quasars and distant galaxies. The findings suggest that the constants had their present values impressed on them at a very early stage before the present expansion phase of the Universe.
