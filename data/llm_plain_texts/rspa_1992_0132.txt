tldr: The article investigates the motion of a rigid block tethered at one corner and subjected to harmonic forcing. The dynamics of the problem involve subharmonic responses, multiple solutions, period-doubling bifurcations, and more. The stability boundaries are given for various parameters, and orbits are shown to be possible for a wide range of forcing amplitudes. The study compares the block's behavior to that of an inverted pendulum impacting one of two asymmetrically placed side-walls.
