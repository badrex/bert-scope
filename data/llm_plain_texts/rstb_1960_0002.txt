tldr: The authors used electronic computation to study the effect of random fluctuations on gene frequencies in rapidly evolving populations, specifically focusing on homostyle primrose populations. They found that these fluctuations can account for the irregularities in homostyle distribution in natural populations and created artificial maps that closely resemble real maps of homostyle distribution. This research provides a better understanding of the evolutionary process and the role of random fluctuations in population genetics.
