tldr: The authors studied the photochemical isomerization of cycloheptatriene and cycloheptatriene-d\lt;sub\gt;8\lt;/sub\gt; in the gas phase. They found that the isomerization occurs via a vibrationally excited ground state molecule and can be quenched by added gases according to the Stern-Volmer law. The study provides insights into unimolecular reaction theory and the mechanism of the formation of minor products.
