tldr: The author, J. A. Broun, examines the power of the eye and the microscope to see parallel lines. Through a series of observations, he determines the factors that affect the visibility of lines, such as distance, angle, and illumination. Broun's findings contribute to the understanding of the limitations of microscopes and the human eye in perceiving fine details.
