tldr: This article surveys the environmental effects of North Sea oil and gas developments, focusing on the various inputs to the North Sea resulting from these activities. It highlights that the atmosphere, rivers, and land run-off, along with coastal oil industry activities and shipping, are major sources of petroleum hydrocarbons. The input from North Sea oil and gas developments has increased significantly, primarily due to the use of oil-based drill-muds and the subsequent discharge of drill cuttings contaminated with residual mud. The article emphasizes the need for better understanding and management of these inputs to protect the North Sea's ecosystems.
