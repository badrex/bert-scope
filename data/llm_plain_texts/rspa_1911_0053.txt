tldr: The authors conducted experiments with various gases and vapors in a vacuum tube to study their anode and cathode spectra. They observed differences in the spectra of different gases, which they attributed to the process of electrolysis and the behavior of ions near the electrodes. The results provide insights into the chemical reactions and properties of gases under the influence of an electric discharge.
