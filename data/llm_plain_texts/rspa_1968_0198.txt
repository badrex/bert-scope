tldr: The authors studied the orange-red emission bands of copper oxide (CuO) using a heavy isotope of oxygen, 180. They analyzed the vibrational and rotational structures of the bands and assigned the transition to a 2E-2T1 transition. The study provides a provisional vibrational analysis of the band heads and evaluates molecular constants. The findings challenge previous published analyses, which were shown to be incorrect.
