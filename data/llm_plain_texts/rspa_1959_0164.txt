tldr: This article explores the eigenvalues in problems with spherical symmetry, focusing on the behavior of the number of eigenvalues not exceeding a certain value. The author extends previous work by considering cases where the function is a constant and applies van der Corput's theorem to derive approximations. The results are applicable to a range of problems in mathematical physics.
