tldr: The article proposes a new model for the propulsion of Dictyostelium discoideum grex, focusing on how each amoeba contributes motive force and how the force contributions create a coordinated collective effort. The model suggests that cell circulation within the grex serves as the propulsive engine for migrating grexes, with amoebae orienting their motion by cAMP chemotaxis. Experiments support the model's predictions and provide insights into the cell trajectories responsible for grex locomotion.
