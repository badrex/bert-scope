tldr: In 1666, J. Denis, a doctor and professor of philosophy and mathematics in Paris, reported a successful case of blood transfusion to cure a patient with inveterate frenzy. The patient, who had suffered from periodic fits of madness for eight years, received blood from a calf in two separate transfusions. The treatment led to a significant improvement in the patient's behavior and mental state, suggesting the potential benefits of blood transfusion in treating mental health disorders.
