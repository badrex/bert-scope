tldr: The author investigates the distribution of energy dissipation in a pipe using correlation measurements and the theory of turbulence. They find that the dissipation rate increases towards the walls of the pipe and that the rate of transformation of mean flow energy into turbulent energy is greater near the walls. The study also highlights the limitations of the dissipation formula in non-isotropic turbulence regions.
