tldr: The author examines the embryonic development of four cirripede crustacean species, including Tetraclita rosea, Tetraclita purpurascens, Chthamalus antennatus, and Chamaesipho columna. They found that the development of these species follows a modified spiral cleavage pattern, with the yolk being confined within a single large cell. The study aims to reveal the basic mode of modification of spiral cleavage in Crustacea and establish the fate of the blastomeres in contributing to the structure of the nauplius after total cleavage.
