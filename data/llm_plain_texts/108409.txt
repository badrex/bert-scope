tldr: The author conducted a series of experiments on the diffusion of various solutions of potash, soda, and their salts. They observed the diffusion rates of different concentrations and found that the diffusion rates varied between different salts and bases. The author also compared the diffusion rates of hydrates, carbonates, and sulfates of potash and soda, providing insights into the diffusive relation between these important bases.
