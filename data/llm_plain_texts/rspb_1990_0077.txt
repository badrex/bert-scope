tldr: The authors conducted a comparative analysis of families of homologous globular proteins to characterize and quantify the structural constraints on amino acid substitutions in protein evolution. They classified residues based on amino acid type, secondary structure, accessibility, and side-chain hydrogen bonding, identifying distinct patterns of substitution that can be used to construct sequence templates, predict tertiary environments, and test the validity of putative structures.
