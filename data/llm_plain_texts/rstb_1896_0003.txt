tldr: The authors conducted a microscopic and systematic study of madreporarian coral types, focusing on their skeletal structure and evolution. They analyzed the differences in the development of the coral skeleton in various sub-classes of Coelenterates and the various forms it takes within each sub-class. The study also discussed the work of previous researchers and the advancements in the understanding of coral biology during the latter half of the 19th century.
