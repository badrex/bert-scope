tldr: The study investigates how life expectancy and egg load affect the oviposition decisions of a solitary parasitoid, Venturia canescens. Researchers found that wasps with a reduced life expectancy and higher egg loads are more likely to lay eggs in low-quality hosts. This demonstrates that parasitoids can adjust their oviposition behavior based on their life expectancy and resources available for reproduction.
