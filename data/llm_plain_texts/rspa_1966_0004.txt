tldr: This article reexamines the boundary conditions for thin elastic shells, extending the work of previous papers by Green. The authors obtain the four 'usual' boundary conditions, two of which were previously found, and provide a simplified approach to the problem. The findings are relevant to the development of a complete two-dimensional theory of shells.
