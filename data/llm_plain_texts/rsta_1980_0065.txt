tldr: The article discusses the development and properties of metal matrix composites reinforced with Fibre FP, a new inorganic fibre based on aluminium oxide. The author presents a versatile fabrication technique for incorporating Fibre FP into metal matrices, demonstrating its use in magnesium, aluminium, lead, copper, and zinc composites. The composites exhibit high mechanical properties, excellent fibre/matrix bonding, and retain their properties at elevated temperatures. The author also explores the challenges and potential applications of these new materials in engineering structures.
