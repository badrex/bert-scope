tldr: The authors study Leech roots, which are fundamental roots for the even unimodular lattice in Lorentzian space. They provide a table of Leech roots in both Euclidean and hyperbolic coordinates and explain how these roots simplify and explain the results of Vinberg and Inskaia on reflexion groups of unimodular Lorentzian lattices in dimensions below 20.
