tldr: 'Keith Edward Bullen was a prominent geophysicist known for his work on earthquake waves and the Earth's interior. He made significant contributions to the understanding of seismic wave travel times, epicentral distances, and the Earth's ellipticity. Bullen's research led to the discovery of the Earth's core and its density, which revolutionized the field of geophysics.'
