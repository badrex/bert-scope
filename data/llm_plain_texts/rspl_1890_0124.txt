tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine if the substances extracted from flesh, such as kreatine and kreatinin, are truly present in the flesh or are products of chemical or physical processes during extraction. They found that kreatine is not present in fresh muscle but is a result of bacterial action, while kreatinin is likely a true component of muscle tissue.
