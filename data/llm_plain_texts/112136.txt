tldr: This study investigates the rate at which salts of lithium pass into and out of the body's vascular and non-vascular textures. The author found that lithium can quickly diffuse into various tissues and organs, and it can be detected in the urine for several days after ingestion. The rate of diffusion depends on factors such as the amount of lithium consumed, the individual's age, and the presence of food in the stomach.
