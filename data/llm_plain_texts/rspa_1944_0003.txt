tldr: The authors apply the matrix theory of correlations to study the order-disorder equilibrium in a lattice, specifically in binary alloys. They derive the specific heat curve for lattices in two and three dimensions, but find that the resulting curve does not resemble experimental data. The authors discuss possible reasons for this discrepancy, such as the effect of thermal expansion or inaccuracies in the nearest neighbor model.
