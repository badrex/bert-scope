tldr: The authors present observations of envelope-like prominences and their relationship to the solar corona. They describe a series of concentric envelopes photographed using a spectroheliograph, which indicates a connection between the prominence material and the structure of the lower corona. The authors suggest that these envelope forms may be the origin of certain in-curving structures found in coronal streamers.
