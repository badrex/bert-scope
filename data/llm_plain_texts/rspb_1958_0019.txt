tldr: The study examines the non-specific hydroxylation of aromatic amino acids in the developing insect cuticle of Calliphora vomitoria. The cuticle is capable of hydroxylating phenylalanine and tryptophan, producing various polyphenols, including hydroquinone, catechol, and pyrogallol. The non-specific hydroxylation process is not enzymatic and involves transamination reactions.
