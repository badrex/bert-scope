tldr: The author examines the morphology and cytology of Bacterium malvacearum, the organism responsible for angular leaf-spot disease in cotton plants. They observe the formation and liberation of coccoid bodies, which are involved in vegetative reproduction, and the process of cell fusion, leading to the development of zygospore-like structures. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the life cycle and reproduction mechanisms of this plant-pathogenic bacterium.
