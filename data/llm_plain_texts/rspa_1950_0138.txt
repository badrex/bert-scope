tldr: This article investigates the stability of viscous flow over concave cylindrical surfaces using asymptotic solutions. The study confirms Gortler's conclusions that disturbances can only occur on concave surfaces and that there are multiple steady states. The results provide insight into the behavior of flow over concave surfaces, which is similar to the case of rotating cylinders.
