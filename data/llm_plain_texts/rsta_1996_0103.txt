tldr: This article discusses the conduction of electrons through ultra-thin insulators, specifically thin SiO2 layers, and how their behavior can be accurately described by the Fowler-Nordheim mechanism. The authors explain how electrons tunnel through the energy barrier at the cathode interface, drift to the anode, and how quantum oscillations in the tunnel current can be used to determine layer thicknesses with high precision. They also explore the degradation of dielectric properties due to energy loss of injected electrons, which can lead to increased current leakage, negative or positive space-charge evolution, and dielectric losses.
