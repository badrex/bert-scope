tldr: The authors present a new method to reformulate the propagation functions of quantum electrodynamics in a way that avoids explicit reference to infinite renormalization constants. They achieve this by incorporating a limiting process into the equations themselves, extending the methods introduced by Dirac and Heisenberg. This approach aims to provide a better foundation for the equations and improve the understanding of the underlying theory.
