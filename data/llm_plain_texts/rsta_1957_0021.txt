tldr: The author investigates the aerodynamic forces on an aerofoil in non-uniform unsteady motion within a closed tunnel. They develop a general upwash distribution and obtain expressions for the lift and moment on the aerofoil. The study considers two types of upwash distributions: a sudden gust and harmonic oscillations. The results provide corrections for wind tunnel measurements to reduce them to their corresponding free-stream values.
