tldr: The author describes the extension of a calibration range for gravimeters in North America using pendulum observations at various stations. The study covers a range of over 4300 mgals, with observations made in 1952 and 1953. The results provide valuable data for understanding the Earth's gravity field and improving the accuracy of gravimeter measurements.
