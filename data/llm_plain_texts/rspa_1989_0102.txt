tldr: The author presents a detailed analysis of the calibration process for area-detector diffractometers, specifically focusing on television detectors. The article discusses the imaging geometry, distortions, and calibration techniques for these detectors, including the use of bivariate power-series expansions and the conjugate-gradient algorithm of least-squares optimization. The author also describes the use of an amorphous fluorescent-scatterer to uniformly illuminate the detector with intense X-rays.
