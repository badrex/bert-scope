tldr: Dr. John Lewis Tiarks conducted experiments using chronometers in two expeditions to determine the longitude of Madeira and Falmouth. The results showed a difference in longitude measurements, leading to a conclusion that the Earth's ellipticity might have been overestimated in previous surveys. The study helped refine the measurement of longitude and the understanding of the Earth's shape.
