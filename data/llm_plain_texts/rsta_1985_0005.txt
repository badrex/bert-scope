tldr: This article discusses the electrical and magnetic properties of low-dimensional solids, focusing on charge storage and charge transport in conducting polymers. The author explains the concepts of solitons, polarons, and bipolarons, and demonstrates their importance in understanding the behavior of these materials. Experimental results on polyacetylene and polythiophene are presented, showing how these concepts can be applied to a wide range of conducting polymers.
