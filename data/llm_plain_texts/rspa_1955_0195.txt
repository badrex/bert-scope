tldr: The authors measured the thermal conductivity of liquid helium below 1°K and found that the heat flow is proportional to the temperature gradient. They concluded that the heat transfer is mainly due to phonons, which are scattered only at the boundaries of the specimen. This study provides insights into the mechanism responsible for heat transport in liquid helium at low temperatures.
