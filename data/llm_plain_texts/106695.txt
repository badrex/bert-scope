tldr: 'In this article, William Herschel presents a catalogue of 2,000 new nebulae and clusters of stars discovered using his twenty-feet reflector telescope. He discusses the importance of these objects as whole sidereal systems and suggests that stars are suns that form parts of larger systems. Herschel also describes the method of analyzing these systems and the properties of star clusters, such as their spherical shape and equal scattering of stars within them.'
