  - Reflection coefficient statistics
tldr: The authors investigate the impact of reflection coefficient statistics on the seismic method, focusing on elastic scattering and the minimum detectable reflection coefficient. They discuss the effects of internal multiple noise and the signal-to-noise ratio, setting a fundamental limit to the seismic reflection method. The study also explores the use of seismic 'windows' and the importance of low-frequency cutoff limits in detecting target reflections.
