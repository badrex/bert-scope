tldr: This study investigates the kinetics of hemolysis in cell-bile salt-serum systems. The authors found that the addition of serum to systems containing sodium taurocholate and red blood cells can either accelerate or inhibit hemolysis, depending on the concentration of serum and the time the lysin has reacted with the cells. The taurocholate appears to sensitize the cells to the lytic action of the serum, and the results provide insights into the complex interactions between serum proteins, bile salts, and red blood cells.
