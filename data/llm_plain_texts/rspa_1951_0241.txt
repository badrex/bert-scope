tldr: The authors studied the infra-red spectrum of potassium bifluoride at different temperatures to understand its crystal structure and the structure of the (HF2)- ion. They found that the best interpretation of the vibrational spectrum supports a symmetrical structure for the ion, with a single minimum in the potential energy function. The study also provides insights into the molecular environment and selection rules in the crystal state.
