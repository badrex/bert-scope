tldr: This article explores the mineralogical aspects of sedimentary rocks and ores, focusing on the effects of metamorphism on stratabound metal concentrations. It discusses the importance of understanding metamorphic processes for ore genesis and exploration, particularly in the Northwestern Cape Province of South Africa, which contains large base metal deposits. The study combines various geoscientific disciplines to provide a comprehensive understanding of the region's mineral deposits and their formation.
