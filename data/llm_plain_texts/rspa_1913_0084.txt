tldr: The authors used X-ray diffraction and crystallography techniques to analyze the structure of the diamond. They discovered that the diamond has a face-centered cubic lattice with carbon atoms arranged in a specific pattern. The analysis also revealed that the diamond has no second-order spectrum, which helped in determining the number of carbon atoms in the crystal structure.
