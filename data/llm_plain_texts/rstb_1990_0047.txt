tldr: This article discusses the role of growth factors and receptor gene rearrangements in the development and differentiation of T lymphocytes within the thymus. It explains how stem cells migrate to the thymus and undergo a series of T cell receptor gene rearrangements, leading to the production of mature T cells. The article also explores the involvement of growth factors like IL-2 and IL-4 in thymocyte proliferation and the mechanisms of negative selection to remove autoreactive cells.
