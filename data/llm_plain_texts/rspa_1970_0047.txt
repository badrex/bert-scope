tldr: The article investigates an ideal gas of non-degenerate electrons in a Gaussian random potential, focusing on its application to polycrystalline semiconductors. The authors use Feynman's path-integral formulation to calculate the averaged canonical density matrix and energy-level density. They also discuss the conditions under which the 'quantal distribution function' is reduced to the Maxwell distribution function, providing insights into the validity of the Boltzmann-equation theory in this context.
