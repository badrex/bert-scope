tldr: This study investigates the influence of magnetization on the corrosion of iron and steel in a cupric chloride solution. The results show that magnetization causes a small increase in corrosion, likely due to local currents inducing greater chemical action. The author also observes the effect of magnetization on the electrolytic deposition of copper from its solutions on iron and steel.
