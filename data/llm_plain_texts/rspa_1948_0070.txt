tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the Q values of the (d, p) reactions in magnesium, aluminium, and silicon. They used a high-voltage equipment to accelerate deuterons and studied the emitted protons' ranges to determine the Q values. The results provided a means to investigate the energy levels of the residual heavy nuclei and improve the accuracy of nuclear mass values in the Periodic Table between neon and sulphur.
