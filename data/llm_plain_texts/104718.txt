tldr: In 1749, Mr. Henry Baker described a powerful earthquake that shook London. The event was felt universally throughout the city and was more violent than a previous earthquake that occurred on February 8th. People reported feeling the shaking in their homes, and some even experienced it while on the River Thames. This account provides a glimpse into the impact of a significant natural disaster on 18th-century London.
