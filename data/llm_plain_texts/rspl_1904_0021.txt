tldr: The authors describe their experiments in casting large, uniform silver trial-plates. They found that by pouring the molten alloy into a cold mould from the bottom and using rapid cooling, they could achieve a constant standard silver plate. This method contradicts the previously accepted theory that slow and uniform cooling is necessary for uniformity in standard alloys.
