tldr: Researchers studied the asymmetry in nine characters of male red-winged blackbirds to understand its relation to mate selection. They found that although there was a weak concordance in asymmetry among characters, overall asymmetry was poorly predicted by individual characters. Epaulets, a secondary sexual trait, exhibited greater asymmetry, but it was not better at predicting overall asymmetry. The results suggest that investigations of asymmetry consequences should focus on traits affecting performance directly, and a multiple-character approach should be used when individual quality is at issue.
