tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments to study the transmission of cathode rays through matter. They found that cathode rays can penetrate several millimeters of air and developed a method to measure the velocity of the fastest rays. The study also showed that the ionization of the rays is independent of pressure above normal atmospheric pressure.'
