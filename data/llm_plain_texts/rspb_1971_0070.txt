tldr: This study reviews the fossil penguins found on Seymour Island, off the Antarctic Peninsula, and reevaluates their age and taxonomy. The penguin fossils are believed to be from the late Eocene epoch, earlier than previously thought. The study examines two collections of fossil penguins from Seymour Island, one from a Swedish expedition in 1901-1903 and the other from a British expedition in 1946. The research provides insights into the ecology and distribution of these ancient penguins, suggesting they lived in warmer waters than present-day Antarctic coasts.
