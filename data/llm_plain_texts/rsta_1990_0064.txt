tldr: This article discusses the variability of mixing and internal waves at the continental slope, focusing on observations made off the west slope of the Porcupine Bank. The authors describe the complex boundary layer structure and the role of internal waves in modifying temperature gradients and creating zones of turbulence. They also explore the effects of non-uniform stratification, varying flows, and slope roughness on mixing processes.
