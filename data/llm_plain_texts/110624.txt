tldr: The author presents a new hydropneumatic baroscope for measuring atmospheric pressure that overcomes the limitations of the ordinary mercurial barometer. The instrument works by using a float with a known volume of air and water, which adjusts its level according to the external pressure. The author provides a detailed description of the apparatus, its usage, and the necessary calculations for determining atmospheric pressure.
