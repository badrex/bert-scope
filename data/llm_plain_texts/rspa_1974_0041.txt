tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effective conductivity of dilute suspensions containing highly conducting slender inclusions. They found that the electric conductivity of these suspensions agreed with a theoretical expression derived by the authors. The experiments confirmed the theoretical predictions for three different types of fibers with slenderness ratios ranging from 0.0106 to 0.0897.
