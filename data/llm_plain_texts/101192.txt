tldr: 'A large loadstone weighing 60 pounds was discovered in Devonshire. It was presented to the Royal Society by Reverend Arch-deacon Doctor Edward Cotton. The loadstone could move a needle nine feet away. Experiments were planned to test the stone's magnetic properties with and without its cap, both separately and together.'
