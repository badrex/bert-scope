tldr: The author, Jacob Perkins, conducted experiments to study the compressibility of water using a piezometer. He found that water compresses by about 1% under a pressure of 100 atmospheres and expands by 39% under 326 atmospheres of pressure. Perkins also observed that water can force its way through a corked bottle when under deep ocean pressure. He plans to share more precise results in future communications.
