tldr: John Ingenhousz, a medical doctor, shares a method for lighting a candle using a small electrical spark. He explains how to charge a small glass phial, apply resin powder, and ignite it with an electrical spark to light the candle. This method is faster and more convenient than using flint and steel or calling a servant. Ingenhousz also discusses alternative materials and ways to store electrical charge for future use.
