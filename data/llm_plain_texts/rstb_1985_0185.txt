tldr: The article describes a cell marking technique based on the structural differences between chick and Japanese quail cells, allowing researchers to study cell lineage and cell migrations during avian development. The quail-chick marker system has been used to create chimeric tissues and embryos, providing valuable insights into cell differentiation and ontogeny.
