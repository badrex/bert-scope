tldr: The authors studied the adsorption of gases from binary gas mixtures by silica gel, focusing on oxygen-argon, oxygen-nitrogen, and oxygen-helium mixtures. They developed a simplified experimental procedure to determine the pressure-concentration equilibria and found that each gas is adsorbed by silica gel at 0°C in amounts directly proportional to the pressure. The results provide insights into how the adsorption of each gas in a binary mixture is affected by the presence of the other.
