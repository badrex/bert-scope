tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effects of electric light on plant growth and found that electric light can promote vegetation. The plants exposed to both electric and sunlight showed the best growth and vigor. This discovery suggests that electric light could be used in conjunction with sunlight to aid in plant growth in greenhouses.
