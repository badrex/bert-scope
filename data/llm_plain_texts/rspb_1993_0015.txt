tldr: The author analyzes the spatio-temporal patterns in natural plankton communities and interprets them as non-equilibrium solutions of nonlinear interaction-advection systems. The study considers factors such as light sensitivity, nutrient availability, and the effects of external forces like fish predation. The research provides insights into the formation and dynamics of plankton patterns, which have implications for understanding water quality, carbon cycling, and climate.
