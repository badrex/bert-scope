tldr: This paper examines the downstream effects of closing a barrier in a tidal estuary, with a particular focus on the Thames. The study uses linear shallow-water theory to calculate the surge initiated when a steady velocity is brought to rest at the barrier. The theory considers the geometry of the estuary and the manner in which the barrier is closed, taking into account frictional resistance. The results are applied to the proposed Thames Tidal Barrier, showing reasonable agreement with model tests.
