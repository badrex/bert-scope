tldr: The authors derive an exact expression for the spin-orbit coupling constant within the Hartree-Fock description of atoms by considering the two-body mutual spin-orbit interaction between electrons. They find that the usual expression for the coupling constant is only approximate and that exchange terms, which arise from the two-body interaction and determinantal wave function, must also be included. The resulting expression for the spin-orbit coupling constant is given in terms of radial integrals that can be calculated using Hartree or Hartree-Fock wave functions.
