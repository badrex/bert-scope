tldr: This article examines the anatomy and reproduction of Salpa and Pyrosoma, two types of ascidians. The author, Thomas Huxley, investigates the unique reproductive processes in these creatures, including gemmation and sexual generation. He also discusses the zoological relations between Salpa, Pyrosoma, and other ascidians, and proposes the term "zooids" for these highly-organized independent forms.
