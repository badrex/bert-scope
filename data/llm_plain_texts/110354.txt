tldr: Samuel Hunter Christie proposes improvements in the instruments and methods used to determine the direction and intensity of terrestrial magnetism. He suggests a method to determine the dip without inverting the poles of the needle and also proposes a compound needle to measure both the dip and intensity. This would provide more accurate and faster results, reducing the need for tedious observations.
