tldr: Researchers discovered the structure of Vitamin B12 crystals grown from and immersed in water. They used X-ray diffraction to analyze the crystal structure and found that the molecules make contact with each other through hydrogen bonds. The analysis also revealed the presence of water molecules between the molecules, which play a role in the crystal's structure and behavior.
