tldr: The authors studied the factors affecting the measurement of absorption bands in blood, particularly focusing on the impact of wave-length variations, light intensity, and retinal adaptation. They discovered that these factors can cause discrepancies in the accuracy of carbon monoxide saturation estimations in blood samples. The study provides valuable insights into improving the precision of blood analysis techniques.
