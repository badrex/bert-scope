tldr: This article presents an investigation of the energy losses suffered by electrons in carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide gases. The authors measured the energy distributions of the scattered electrons and found that the results for the two gases are distinctly different. The study provides insights into the energy levels and possible applications in spectroscopy and gas physics.
