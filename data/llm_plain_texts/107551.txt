tldr: The author examines the milk tusks and organ of hearing of the dugong using a well-preserved skull. They discovered that the milk tusks are used to make room for the permanent tusks and found a unique connection between the malleus, incus, and tympanum in the dugong's hearing organ. This research helps to understand the anatomy and development of these features in dugongs and their relation to other animals.
