tldr: This article examines the relationship between the diurnal range of magnetic declination and horizontal force observed at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, from 1841 to 1877, and the period of solar spot frequency. The author finds a strong correlation between the magnetic and solar phenomena, with both showing an eleven-year cycle. The study also suggests that the annual inequalities of magnetic diurnal range may be subject to periodical variation, increasing at sunspot maxima and decreasing at sunspot minima.
