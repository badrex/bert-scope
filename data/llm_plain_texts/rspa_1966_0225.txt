tldr: The authors used a new two-beam dark field electron microscope technique to determine the Burgers vectors of dislocations in iron and iron alloys. They investigated the screw-edge characters and directions of various dislocations and found that the simple ideas involving only edge dislocations intersecting to form screw dislocations in body-centered cubic metals need to be significantly modified.
