tldr: The author examines and reclassifies the Bicoecidae family, specifically the Bicoeca species, which were initially described by James-Clark. They differentiate between two forms of B. lacustris and propose to separate them into two species: B. lacustris and B. vacillans. Additionally, a new marine species, B. maris, is described. The author discusses the affinities and differences between the Bicoecidae, Bodonidae, and Craspedomonadidae families.
