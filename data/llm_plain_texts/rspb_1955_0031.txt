tldr: The article investigates the fate of uniformly labelled 14C glucose in rat brain slices using radio paper chromatography. It shows that about 60% of the glucose disappears from the medium as lactic acid, while 20% is converted into CO2. The main amino acids formed from glucose are glutamic acid, alanine, and y-amino-butyric acid. Insulin has no effect on glucose metabolism in brain slices. The study also shows that under anaerobic conditions, glucose metabolism is significantly lower than under aerobic conditions.
