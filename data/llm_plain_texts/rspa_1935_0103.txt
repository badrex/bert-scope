tldr: The authors conducted an X-ray study on the structures of caesium salts of phosphotungstic and other 12-heteropoly acids. They discovered that the salts have a unique crystal structure with three caesium atoms per molecule, replacing some water molecules in the 5-hydrate form of the acid. The study also found that the caesium salts are very stable and have a consistent structure even after heating or treating with strong acids.
