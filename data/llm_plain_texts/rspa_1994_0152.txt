tldr: This article studies the concept of contact transformations and lift transformations in mathematics, particularly focusing on their applications in meteorology. The authors provide new examples of lift transformations and demonstrate how they can transform unfamiliar systems of partial differential equations into familiar ones, as well as how they can be used to improve our understanding of contact transformations.
