tldr: This article discusses the pericellular environment and its regulation in vertebrate cartilage tissues. It examines the ultrastructure and histochemistry of the pericellular region, focusing on the distribution of proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans, and how these change with cartilage aging. The study provides insights into the structural and functional aspects of the pericellular environment in cartilage.
