tldr: The author investigates Hertzian electromagnetic potentials and their associated gauge transformations, showing that these potentials can be subjected to a new type of transformation that leaves the electromagnetic field invariant. The author also generalizes the inhomogeneous Maxwell equations, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of Hertzian representations and their applications in various media.
