semantic_tags:
  - Crystallography
  - X-ray diffraction
  - Crystal structure
  - Bragg's Law

tldr: 'The authors describe a new method to investigate the structure of crystals using X-ray diffraction. They explain how the diffraction patterns can be analyzed to determine the crystal's structure and provide a detailed explanation of the process, including the use of Miller indices and the concept of zone axes.'
