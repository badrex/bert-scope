tldr: The authors propose a binding-site model for calcium channel inactivation that depends on calcium entry. They assume that calcium that enters through the membrane accumulates in a submembrane compartment and binds to a site at the internal membrane surface, causing inactivation of calcium channels. The model predicts the results of single and double-pulse voltage-clamp experiments and explains the turn-off of calcium currents without assuming a voltage-dependent component of inactivation or two populations of calcium channels.
