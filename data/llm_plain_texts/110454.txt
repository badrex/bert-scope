tldr: The author, James Farquharson, studied the unique ice formations that occur at the bottom of rivers and streams. He found that these ice formations are caused by differences in heat radiation from the river's bottom due to factors like clear skies and water transparency. This research helps explain why ice forms at the river's bottom while the surface remains unfrozen.
