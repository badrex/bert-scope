tldr: The author investigates the terminal oxidases in the respiration of barley embryos and young roots. They find that while cytochrome oxidase is the main final oxidase in plant embryos, it may be absent in young roots. The study shows that electron transfer in roots continues through ascorbic oxidase, which is also present in embryos but plays a minor role in electron transfer.
