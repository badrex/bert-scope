tldr: The authors developed a Michelson Fourier-transform spectrometer with field compensation for visible and near-infrared regions, achieving an etendue 1000 times greater than grating spectrometers. They used the instrument to obtain high-resolution spectra of the night airglow, demonstrating its potential for studying atmospheric phenomena.
