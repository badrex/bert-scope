tldr: This study uses satellite transmitters and stomach recorders to track the foraging patterns of wandering albatrosses and their prey in the southern Indian Ocean. The albatrosses travel up to 3600 km to find scarce prey, mostly squid, which are distributed without relation to underwater topography. The findings demonstrate that the foraging patterns of large seabirds can help increase our knowledge of the distribution and availability of poorly known but widespread species of squid.
