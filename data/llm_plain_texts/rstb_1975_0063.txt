tldr: The study investigates the ultrastructure of the trochanteral depressor muscle in the oriental rat flea, Xenopsylla cheopis. The muscle's fine structure is described, revealing a unique tripartite arrangement of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This arrangement is discussed in relation to the muscle's function as the main propulsive muscle in the flea's jump.
