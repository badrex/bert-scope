tldr: The authors compared sun-spot areas with diurnal temperature-ranges at Toronto and Kew, finding a close connection between short-period inequalities in sun-spot areas and terrestrial meteorological inequalities. They discovered that sun-spot inequalities around 24 and 26 days have periods similar to those of terrestrial meteorological inequalities, suggesting a potential relationship between solar and terrestrial phenomena.
