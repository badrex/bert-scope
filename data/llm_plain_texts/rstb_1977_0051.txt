tldr: The study investigates the effects of monocular deprivation on the visual system of cats and how it affects the lateral geniculate nucleus, visual cortex, and superior colliculus. The results show that cats with a reverse suture, where the deprived eye was opened and the non-deprived eye was closed, had a remarkable recovery. The cats with the non-deprived eye removed had the most significant improvement in the visual responses of cortical and collicular neurons. However, the responses were still not completely normal.
