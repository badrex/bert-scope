tldr: This article explores the use of high-resolution electron microscopy to study the ultrastructure of carbons, graphitic compounds, and zeolitic catalysts in coal chemistry. The techniques reveal the onset of crystallinity in coals, changes in hydrodesulphurization catalysts, and structural features in metal catalysts supported on graphitic carbons and graphite intercalates. The research also focuses on zeolites, which play a significant role in converting methanol to petrol and other chemicals from coal and its gasified products.
