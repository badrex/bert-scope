tldr: The authors developed a simple and accurate photoelectric method for measuring the velocity of rapid reactions, using a modified Hartridge-Roughton apparatus. This method can measure reactions requiring 200 cc or more of each reagent and has a wide range of applications, including pH indicators and other colorimetric observations. The technique improves fluid economy and extends the range of measurable reactions, making it a valuable tool for studying rapid chemical reactions.
