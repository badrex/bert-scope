tldr: In this article, Michael Faraday discusses the concept of lines of magnetic force and their significance in representing magnetic forces, conditions, and directions. He explains how these lines can be used to study magnetic phenomena and introduces the use of a moving conductor to indicate the presence and direction of magnetic force, providing a new method alongside the magnetic needle for studying magnetic fields.
