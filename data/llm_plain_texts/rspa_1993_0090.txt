tldr: This article reviews the development of surface crystallography using low-energy electron diffraction (LEED). It discusses the principles and capabilities of LEED, its history, and its applications in studying various surface structures. LEED has become a valuable tool for understanding surface properties and has contributed to the determination of over 300 surface structures.
