tldr: The author conducted an aeromagnetic survey across the Red Sea to study the structure and evolution of the Red Sea rift valley. The survey revealed significant magnetic anomalies, including a dominant axial trough anomaly and other features related to faulting and igneous intrusions. The findings provide insights into the geology and tectonics of the region, as well as the relationship between magnetic fields and hot brine areas.
