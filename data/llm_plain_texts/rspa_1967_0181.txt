tldr: The authors studied the effects of oxygen on radiation-induced reactions of ethylene in aqueous solutions using pulse radiolysis and y-irradiation techniques. They found that oxygen replaces polymerization with oxidation and observed the formation and further reactions of peroxy radicals. The results complement previous studies and provide insights into the radiation chemistry of ethylene and oxygen in aqueous solutions.
