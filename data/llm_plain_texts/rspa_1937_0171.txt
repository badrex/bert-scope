tldr: The author conducted experiments on tin crystals to study the influence of the difference in orientation of two crystals on the mechanical effect of their boundary. They found that the critical stress required for deformation varies with the angle between the crystal orientations, with the highest stress occurring when the angle is 90 degrees. This research helps to understand the properties of crystal boundaries and their impact on the mechanical behavior of materials.
