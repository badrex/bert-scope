tldr: The authors develop a fully relativistic theory of high-pressure elasticity, focusing on its application to neutron stars. They introduce a quasi-Hookean perfect elasticity theory that accounts for the intense gravitational forces and the mechanical behavior of neutron star crusts. This theory can be applied to various problems, such as the interaction of gravitational radiation with planetary bodies and the vibrations and deformations of neutron star crusts.
