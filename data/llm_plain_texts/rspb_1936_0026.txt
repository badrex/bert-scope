tldr: The authors conducted a study on the anti-thyrotropic activity in animals treated with thyrotropic extracts from the pituitary gland. They found that prolonged injections of thyrotropic extracts led to the production of inhibitory or anti-thyrotropic substances in the blood, which could inhibit the effects of the thyrotropic hormone. The study also examined the anti-thyrotropic activity in normal serum of various species, finding that cow serum showed no inhibitory activity, while slight inhibition was observed in sheep and horse serum.
