tldr: The authors studied the oxidative coupling and polymerization of phenols and quinones, focusing on the formation of complex oxidation products and the role of free radicals in the process. They found that the coupling of phenols and quinones is influenced by the acidity of the solution and the reactivity of the substituents on the molecules. The authors also investigated the intermediate products and their structures, providing insights into the mechanisms of these reactions.
