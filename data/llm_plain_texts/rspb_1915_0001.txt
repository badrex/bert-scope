tldr: The article describes the life cycle and morphology of a new flagellate species, Helkesimastix fecicola, found in goat and sheep dung. The flagellate emerges from its cyst and goes through its life cycle, encysting again. The author isolates and cultivates the flagellate to study its life history and discusses its interaction with bacteria in the environment. The flagellate has a unique trailing flagellum and a single nucleus, with no binucleate or kinetonucleus forms.
