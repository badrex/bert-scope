tldr: This article discusses the origins and evolution of diatoms, a type of algae with complex cell walls made of silica. The authors propose a hypothesis for the development of diatoms, considering their possible early stages, the order of appearance of features, and the evolution of their siliceous structures. They also explore the potential role of sexual reproduction and asexual reproduction in diatom evolution and suggest that studying diatom life cycles may provide insights into their phylogeny.
