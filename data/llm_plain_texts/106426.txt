tldr: This article discusses the author's experiments on the variation of boiling water temperature and its relation to atmospheric pressure. The author used a precise thermometer to measure the boiling point and found that the decrease of boiling heat was greater than the rules admitted of from an alteration of the pressure of the atmosphere. This led to an examination of the observations and a comparison with previous findings.
