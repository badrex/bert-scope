tldr: The study examines the genetic variation in the threatened ghost bat, Macroderma gigas, to understand the levels of current and historical gene flow among populations and the distribution of genetic diversity. The research finds extreme genetic subdivision among the populations, suggesting that the isolation of these populations preceded the historical range contraction. This information is crucial for the management and conservation of the species.
