tldr: The authors extended the theory of interference and diffraction of light from finite sources to include fields with a spectral range of arbitrary width. They introduced a more general correlation function to represent the correlation between disturbances at any two given points in the field. The study provides a rigorous formulation of the generalized Huygens principle and interference law for a wider class of fields, involving observable quantities only.
