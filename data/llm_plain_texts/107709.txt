tldr: Thomas Young presents a finite and exact expression for the refraction of an atmosphere similar to Earth's. The new equation considers the pressure of the atmosphere and provides a more accurate representation of atmospheric refraction, closely aligning with previous tables and the Nautical Almanac.
