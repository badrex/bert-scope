tldr: This study investigates the conduction of impulses in long-range afferent axons in the rat spinal cord. The experiments show that in intact cords, very few fibers can carry orthodromic impulses more than 20mm caudal to the entry point. However, after sectioning neighboring dorsal roots, large numbers of conducting fibers can be recorded at that point. The results suggest that impulse transmission failure and its subsequent relief may depend on the control of membrane potential in primary afferents, forming a pre-presynaptic control mechanism.
