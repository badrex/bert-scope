tldr: The authors studied the impact of dust on the atmospheric potential gradient and found that the presence of dust, whether from wind, traffic, or manufacturing operations, can significantly alter the gradient. Dust composed of siliceous materials tends to decrease or reverse the positive potential, while calcareous materials increase it. The effect is transient and disappears when the dust settles.
