tldr: The authors present a general recursion algorithm for calculating diffracted intensities from crystals containing planar faults. This method is applicable to various types of planar faults, accommodates long-range stacking correlations, and can be used for crystals with a finite number of layers. The algorithm is related to previous approaches but offers a more intuitive and straightforward approach to the stacking disorder problem, making it suitable for complex crystal systems.
