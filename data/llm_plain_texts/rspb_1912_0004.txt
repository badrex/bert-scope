tldr: The authors conducted experiments on rabbits to study the effects of different diets and inanition on cholesterol content in their livers. They found that rabbits fed on a diet rich in cholesterol had higher cholesterol levels in their livers, while rabbits fed on extracted bran had lower levels. The study also showed that when cholesterol was injected into the peritoneal cavity, it led to an increase in liver cholesterol content. These findings provide insights into cholesterol metabolism and its relationship with diet and health.
