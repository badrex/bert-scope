tldr: This study investigates the minimum intensity of different colored lights that can be perceived by the human eye when received on the fovea and at varying distances from its center. The authors found that the sensitivity of the retina to different wavelengths of light varies, and they support the idea that there are two distinct processes involved in the variation of sensations produced by light.
