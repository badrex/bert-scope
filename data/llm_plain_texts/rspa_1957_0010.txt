tldr: The authors explore the Jahn-Teller effect in symmetrical molecules with degenerate electronic states, focusing on the static problem of minimizing the total electronic energy with respect to nuclear framework distortions. They discuss various examples, including linear molecules and octahedral complexes, and provide a theoretical framework for understanding the impact of the Jahn-Teller effect on these systems.
