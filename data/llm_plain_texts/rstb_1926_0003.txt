tldr: This study investigates the resin canals in the Canadian spruce, focusing on their anatomical structure, distribution, and relation to traumatic effects. The research examines the resin canals in various parts of the plant, including roots, stems, and branches, and explores their formation and distribution in response to wounding. The findings provide insights into the importance of resin canals in conifer classification, identification, and phylogeny.
