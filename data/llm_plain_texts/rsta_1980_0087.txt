tldr: 'The authors studied the effects of adsorbed sulfur on the carburization and nitrogenation of iron and steel. They found that sulfur segregation retards surface reactions, preventing carburization and nitridation. This protective effect could be useful in petrochemistry, coal gasification, and high-temperature nuclear reactors.'
