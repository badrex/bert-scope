tldr: This study examines the pseudo-polymorphism in Nerita polita, a gastropod species, focusing on the changes in shell patterns and coloration due to environmental factors. The research reveals that a single genotype can produce various phenotypes, leading to a mixture of characteristic types that intergrade with each other. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the phenomenon of pseudo-polymorphism in gastropods.
