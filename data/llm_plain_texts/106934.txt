tldr: The author, William Hyde Wollaston, examines gouty and urinary concretions, analyzing their chemical composition and properties. He discovers that gouty matter is a neutral compound consisting of lithic acid and mineral alkali, while urinary calculi contain phosphoric acid, magnesia, volatile alkali, phosphorated lime, and lithic acid. This research could lead to improved treatments for gout and a better understanding of the formation of urinary calculi.
