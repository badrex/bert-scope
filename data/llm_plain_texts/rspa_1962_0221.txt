tldr: The authors discuss a method for calculating relativistic gravitational fields using systematic approximations. They focus on improving Einstein's retarded potential formula and reducing the residual energy tensor in space. The method allows for the creation of model universes that are more accurate representations of the actual universe or parts of it.
