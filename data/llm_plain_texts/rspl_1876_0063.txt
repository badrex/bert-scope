tldr: This article investigates the effects of vaso-motor nerves on striated muscle during tetanus. The author observes that blood flow increases during muscle contraction, and that stimulation of the nerve causes dilation of blood vessels followed by constriction. These findings provide insight into the relationship between muscle activity and blood circulation.
