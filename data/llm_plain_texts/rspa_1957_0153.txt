tldr: The authors study the odd-parity states of atomic nuclei, focusing on spin-orbit splittings and collective enhancement. They use the shell model and a force mixture to calculate energy levels and transition probabilities, finding that collective enhancement is necessary to account for the strength of certain transitions. Their calculations agree with experimental data, providing a better understanding of nuclear structure and properties.
