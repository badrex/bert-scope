tldr: 'The authors introduce a new development in atom probe microscopy, which uses time-of-flight elemental analysis to study segregation in materials. This technique provides both qualitative and quantitative information on the distribution of elements in a sample, allowing for a better understanding of materials properties and the effects of residuals and additives.'
