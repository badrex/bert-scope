revised_title: 'Exploring the Function and Location of Enzymes in Plant Cells: A Focus on Plant Mitochondria'
semantic_tags:
  - Mitochondria

  - Enzyme function
  - Krebs cycle
  - Cellular respiration
tldr: The author discusses the challenges of studying enzymes in plant cells due to the presence of a large central vacuole. They describe a method to isolate plant mitochondria and explore their role in cellular respiration, specifically the Krebs cycle. The author presents evidence that plant mitochondria contain enzymes necessary for the Krebs cycle reactions and can carry out the single-step reactions of the cycle.
