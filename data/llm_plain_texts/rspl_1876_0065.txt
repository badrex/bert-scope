tldr: The author explains Mr. Kerr's experiment on the rotation of light polarization by reflection from a magnet's pole. They discovered that the incident plane-polarized light is the result of two circularly polarized rays, one right-handed and the other left-handed. The refractive index for right-handed circularly polarized rays is less than for left-handed ones in a ferromagnetic substance, leading to the rotation of the plane of polarization. This phenomenon can also occur in diamagnetic substances, organic solutions, and quartz, but the effect is much smaller and difficult to observe.
