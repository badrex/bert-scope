tldr: This study investigates the effect of a glaring light source on extrafoveal vision, which is the ability to see objects outside the central focus of the eye. The researchers found that a bright light source can negatively impact visual perception, particularly in peripheral vision. They also discovered that the glare effect can be mitigated by adjusting the brightness of the surrounding environment.
