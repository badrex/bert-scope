tldr: The article describes the structure and connectivity of the nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The hermaphrodite nervous system has 302 neurons arranged in an invariant structure, with simple morphologies and few branches. The neurons are highly locally connected, and the article provides a detailed description of the neuron classes, their connectivity, and the synaptic connections between them. This research helps to understand the genetic control of nervous system development and the functional properties of a nervous system.
