tldr: 'Lord Rayleigh discovers a large-scale crystalline structure in certain glasses of exceptional composition, such as silica glass and "corex" glass. The structure is visible when examined between crossed nicols and is attributed to the crystalline or quasi-crystalline parts of the glass. The double refraction of these crystalline parts is weak and can be eliminated by proper annealing, which helps distinguish the crystalline structure pattern from patterns due to mechanical stress.'
