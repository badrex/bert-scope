tldr: The author, Charles Hatchett, conducted experiments on the effects of sulphuric acid on various substances, including resins, balsams, and gums. He discovered that these substances could produce an artificial tanning substance when digested in sulphuric acid. The author also found that coal was a product of this process and that different substances had varying effects when exposed to the acid. This research contributed to the understanding of tannin and its properties.
