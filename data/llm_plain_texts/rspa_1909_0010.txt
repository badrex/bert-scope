tldr: The author studied the astronomical alignments and orientation of the Botallek Stone Circle in Cornwall, finding that it was used for observing both May-year and solstitial phenomena. The circle's structure and alignments suggest that it was built in two stages, with the May-year group predating the solstitial group by around 300 years.
