tldr: 'This study investigates the chemical composition of post-glacial lake sediments in the English Lake District. The research finds that the composition of the sediments is largely dependent on the erosion of the surrounding soil rather than the biological productivity within the lakes. The study also suggests that the rate of erosion is related to the topography of the watersheds and major climatic changes. The findings provide insights into the availability of nutrients in the lake waters in past times and the redox conditions in the soils and lake muds.'
