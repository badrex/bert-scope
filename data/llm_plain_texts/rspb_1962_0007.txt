tldr: The authors studied the reversion and stability of an adaptive enzyme in bacteria, specifically in \lt;italic\gt;Bact. lactis aerogenes\lt;/italic\gt;, when grown in D-arabinose. They found that the tenacity of adaptation increases with the length of exposure to D-arabinose, and that the bacteria develop this capacity rapidly during a few cell divisions. The loss of this capacity occurs gradually when grown in media that reverse the adaptation.
