tldr: The authors discuss the use of optical diffraction in analyzing electron micrographs of helical structures, specifically in the bacteriophage tail. They explore the application of this method to three different helical components of the bacteriophage tail, including the extended sheath, contracted sheath, and core. The authors explain the principles of optical diffraction and its application to helical structures, as well as the limitations and challenges of this method.
