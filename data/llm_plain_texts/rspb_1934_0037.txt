tldr: The authors conducted experiments on Maia nerve to understand the effect of potassium ions on the injury potential and action current. They found that the injury potential decreases as the potassium chloride concentration increases, and that the action current is influenced by the presence of potassium ions. This study provides insights into the physiological role of potassium ions in nerve function and the potential implications for understanding nerve injury and recovery.
