tldr: This article compares the theoretical investigation of sound velocity, as corrected by M. Dulong, with the experiments of Drs. Moll and Van Beek. It examines the influence of specific heat on sound velocity and discusses the accuracy of the calculations. The results show that Dulong's corrections bring the calculation of sound velocity closer to the truth, and any remaining differences can be attributed to errors in complex observations.
