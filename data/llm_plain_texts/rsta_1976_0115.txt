tldr: This article discusses the contributions of physical metallurgy and fracture mechanics in understanding and controlling stress-corrosion cracking in engineering materials. The author argues that these two disciplines are complementary and essential for addressing the challenges posed by stress-corrosion cracking. The article highlights the use of macroscopic specimens and fracture mechanics to study the effects of microfeatures on stress-corrosion cracking and to improve the properties of materials.
