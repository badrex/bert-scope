tldr: The author conducted a detailed study of the brachial plexus, analyzing the anatomy of the spinal nerves and their functions in the human body. Through dissections of fifty-five plexuses, the author found that the 5th cervical nerve supplies the upper part of the muscle, while the 6th and 7th nerves supply the middle and lower parts. The study provides a better understanding of the complex connections and functions of the brachial plexus and its role in the musculoskeletal system.
