tldr: The authors studied the composition of diphtheria toxin and antitoxin floccules, finding that one unit of toxin combines with one unit of antitoxin to form a balanced compound. They used ultra-violet absorption curves and other methods to analyze the floccules and their properties, providing insights into the nature of both toxin and antitoxin.
