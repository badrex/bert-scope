revised_title: 'The Chemosynthetic Support of Life and Microbial Diversity at Deep-Sea Hydrothermal Vents'

tldr: The author discusses the discovery of rich and unique animal populations near deep-sea hydrothermal vents, which rely on chemosynthesis for their survival. These ecosystems are independent of solar energy and are based on various microbial processes, including bacterial chemosynthesis and a new type of symbiosis between chemolithotrophic prokaryotes and invertebrates. The author also explains the geological and geochemical processes that support these ecosystems, as well as the different types of vents and their associated animal populations.
