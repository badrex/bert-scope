tldr: This study investigates the effects of vasodilator and vasoconstrictor drugs on oxygen tension in the brain and somatic tissues of rats. The researchers found that serotonin caused a significant decrease in oxygen tension in the brain, muscle, testis, and subcutaneous tissues. Other drugs, such as reserpine, amphetamine, and a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, also had varying effects on oxygen tension in different tissues. These findings provide insights into the potential mechanisms behind the central effects of serotonin and the role of oxygen tension in drug-induced changes in the brain.
