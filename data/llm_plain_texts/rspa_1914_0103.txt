tldr: This article investigates the phenomenon of areas of silence and the increased audibility of sound signals in foggy conditions. The author discusses the effects of wind and temperature gradients on sound propagation and suggests that these factors can create silent areas near the source of sound. The author also explores the possibility of using small islands in lonely seas for experiments on sound propagation under various conditions.
