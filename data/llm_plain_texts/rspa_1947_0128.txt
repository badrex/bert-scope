tldr: This article presents a study of seasonal variations in daylight at Plymouth from 1938 to 1941, comparing the results with the years 1930 to 1937. The authors used a Burt vacuum sodium cell to measure daylight and found that the behavior of the photometer remained constant when comparing data from different years. The study provides insights into the changes in daylight and vertical illumination during the study period, which can be useful for understanding the local climate and environmental conditions.
