tldr: The authors studied the physical properties and melting points of sodium borates, discovering that the addition of sodium oxide to boric anhydride raises the melting point continuously. They developed a new method for determining the melting points of glasses and crystals, which they tested using various sodium borate mixtures. The results showed that glasses have a well-defined melting point, contrary to previous assumptions.
