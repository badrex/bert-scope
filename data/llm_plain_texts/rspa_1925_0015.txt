tldr: This article presents a theoretical and experimental study on the formation of water waves by wind. The author explains how air blowing over the surface of the water introduces rotational motions that alter the shape of the waves. The study also discusses the role of turbulence and friction in wave formation and provides estimates for the critical wind velocities and wave lengths needed for wave formation. The findings are in agreement with observed phenomena in mid-ocean.
