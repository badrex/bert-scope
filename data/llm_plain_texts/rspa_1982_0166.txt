tldr: This article presents a new approach to numerical relativity, focusing on the characteristic initial value problem. The authors propose using two null hypersurfaces to simplify the problem and reduce it to the solution of two initial value problems for sets of ordinary differential equations. This approach offers significant advantages, such as allowing almost half of the equations to be treated as ordinary differential equations and providing a way to handle singularities in the space-time. The article outlines the basic equations, the geometry of intersecting null foliations, a particular choice of gauge, and an explicit formulation of the characteristic initial value problem.
