tldr: Edward Meyrick was a remarkable man who made significant contributions to the field of entomology, particularly in the study of Lepidoptera. He was a dedicated teacher and naturalist, and his work in reclassifying the order of Lepidoptera revolutionized the older artificial classification system. Meyrick's research focused on the principles of development and evolution, which he applied to his comprehensive studies of Microlepidoptera.
