tldr: The authors investigate the distribution of anthocyanins in flowers, fruits, and leaves, identifying the simplest anthocyanidin, cyanidin, as the basis for their synthesis. They also find that the presence of a second component in some mixtures may be due to the non-completion of one or more stages in the synthesis process. This research provides insights into the genetic and biochemical aspects of plant pigments.
