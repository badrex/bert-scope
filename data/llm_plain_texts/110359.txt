tldr: 'The author, David Brewster, studied the anatomical and optical structure of the crystalline lenses of animals, particularly in codfish. He discovered that the lens has a prolate spheroid shape and is composed of a hard nucleus surrounded by softer matter. The lens has a unique denticulated structure, with each fiber containing 12,500 teeth, which helps in the refraction of light. This structure is found in fish lenses but not in mammals or birds. Brewster also discussed the doubly-refracting structure of the lens, which exhibits various curious varieties in different animals.'
