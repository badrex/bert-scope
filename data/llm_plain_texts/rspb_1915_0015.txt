tldr: The authors conducted experiments on frogs to study functional edema in their muscles. They discovered that stimulated muscles gained weight, and through specific gravity tests, they found that this weight gain was due to the muscles taking up water from the blood as an osmotic phenomenon. This research helped to understand the relationship between muscle function, circulation, and osmotic processes.
