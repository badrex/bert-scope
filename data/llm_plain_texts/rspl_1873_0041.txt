tldr: This article presents the findings of the author's sixteen years of observations on the annual variation of magnetic declination at the Trevandrum Magnetic Observatory. The author confirms that the magnetic needle follows an annual law producing double oscillations with significant maxima and minima occurring around the end of September and the middle of March. The study also reveals that the results related to the sun's rotation on its axis are the same in both hemispheres, while those related to the Earth's revolution around the sun appear opposite in the two hemispheres.
