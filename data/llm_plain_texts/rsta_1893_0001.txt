tldr: This article investigates the transmission of sunlight through Earth's atmosphere and the absorption and scattering of light by the atmosphere. The author uses a method developed with General Festing to measure the absorption coefficient for different thicknesses of atmosphere and compares the results with observations made at higher altitudes. The study finds that the integral absorption of sunlight can be accurately represented by a formula involving air thickness and a constant, which is related to the scattering of light by small particles. The author also discusses the use of the platinum process in photography to measure the total intensity of sunlight after passing through various air thicknesses.
