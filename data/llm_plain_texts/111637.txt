tldr: The author, George Gore, conducted experiments to understand the movements of liquid metals and electrolytes in voltaic circuits. He discovered that both substances must be in a liquid state and one of them must be a metallic conductor of electricity. The power of producing these movements is a general property of electrolytes and liquid metals. The direction of the movement is influenced by the chemical nature of the electrolyte and the presence of metallic impurities in the mercury.
