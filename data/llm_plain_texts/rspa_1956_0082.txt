tldr: The authors examined thin films of aluminium and gold prepared by vacuum evaporation using electron diffraction. They found that the stress effects on the films could be explained by assuming that each crystallite has its own particular stress system, which is different from the stress tensor having a fixed orientation with respect to the specimen plane. The results provide an interesting example of a dislocation arising during the growth of a crystal being revealed by diffraction.
