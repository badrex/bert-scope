tldr: This article discusses dose-response relations in epidemiological studies, focusing on the risks of cancer associated with exposure to carcinogens such as chrysotile asbestos and ionizing radiation. The authors analyze data from various studies to understand the shape of the dose-response relation and assess the risks associated with different levels of exposure. They conclude that for practical purposes, there is no safe threshold for chrysotile dust and lung cancer, and that turning over the workforce in dusty jobs would not reduce the incidence of lung cancer.
