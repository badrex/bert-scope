tldr: The author presents a mathematical analysis of the laminar boundary-layer equations for elliptic and circular cylinders. They derive and integrate the equations, comparing their results with experimental measurements. The study focuses on the flow of fluids around these shapes, providing insights into the behavior of boundary layers and their applications in engineering and physics.
