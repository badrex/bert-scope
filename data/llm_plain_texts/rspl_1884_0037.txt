tldr: The authors compared sun-spot areas and diurnal temperature-ranges to study the relationship between solar and terrestrial phenomena. They analyzed the data using a method that detects periodicities in the observations and found that there might be a connection between the fluctuations in sun-spot areas and temperature ranges. This research could help improve our understanding of the effects of solar activity on Earth's climate.
