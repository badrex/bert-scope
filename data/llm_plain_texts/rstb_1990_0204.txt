tldr: This study investigates the firing behavior of interneurons in the spinal cord of paralysed spinal dogfish during active swimming. The interneurons are classified into three groups based on their activity patterns and compared with the behavior of motoneurons. The findings provide insights into the interneuronal components of locomotor circuits in vertebrates.
