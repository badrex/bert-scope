tldr: This study presents a model of constant random sperm displacement during mating in the dung fly, Scatophaga. The model predicts that the proportion of offspring fertilized by the last male to mate is determined by the density of the last male's sperm divided by the current total density of sperm in the female's sperm stores. The findings support the random displacement model and provide insights into sperm competition mechanisms in insects.
