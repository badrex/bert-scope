tldr: This article discusses the processes of dissociation, recombination, and attachment in the upper atmosphere, focusing on the ionosphere. The author examines the mechanisms of ion loss, including recombination of oppositely charged ions and attachment of electrons to neutral molecules. The study aims to provide a deeper understanding of the physics of the ionosphere and explain the observed variations in ionization density.
