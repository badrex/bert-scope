tldr: This article discusses the unique and abundant fossil record of Precambrian metazoans, focusing on their ecological and evolutionary significance. The author explores the challenges in studying these ancient organisms, including preservation issues and the lack of mineralized skeletal parts. The article also highlights the importance of body plan analysis in understanding the classification and systematics of these ancient creatures, leading to the recognition of new classes such as Cyclozoa, Inordozoa, and Trilobozoa.
