tldr: The author, John Sackette, describes an unusual phenomenon of the earth sinking near Folkestone in Kent. He observes that the cliffs are pressing forward into the sea and sinking, causing the landscape to change. The chalk hills in the area are believed to have large caverns, springs, and cracks, which may contribute to the sinking. The locals believe that the sinking of the hills forces the cliffs and land forward into the sea. Sackette provides testimonies from several residents to support the occurrence of this phenomenon.
