tldr: The authors develop a molecular theory to explain the propagation of electromagnetic waves in two-component anisotropic polymer systems. They consider the scattering properties of individual particles and the interactions between them, leading to the concept of refractive index and birefringence in these systems. The theory is applicable to strained amorphous polymers and helps understand the behavior of light in these materials.
