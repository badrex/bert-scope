tldr: The author, Edmund J. Mills, discovered a law of chemical activity in nitrates when they are treated with phosphoric oxychloride. This law led to the concept of the "coefficient of chemical activity," which is a constant ratio between the products of the reaction. Mills also found a connection between this coefficient and Dulong and Petit's constant of specific heat, suggesting that the two are related.
