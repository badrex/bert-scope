tldr: The author, George Biddell Airy, computed the lengths of light waves corresponding to the lines in the dispersion spectrum measured by Kirchhoff. He created a formula to convert Kirchhoff's measures into wave lengths and compared the results with other direct measures of wave lengths. The study helped in understanding the accuracy of the wave lengths and their relationship with the spectrum measures.
