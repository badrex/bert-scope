tldr: The authors investigated the thermal decomposition of mercury dimethyl and diethyl using a flow method with low pressures and short contact times. They measured the velocity constant of the rate-determining step and examined the effect of various experimental conditions. The study provided values for the dissociation energies of the first mercury-carbon bonds in these molecules.
