tldr: The author discusses the movement and contraction of protoplasm in cells, comparing it to muscle contractions. They describe how protoplasmic movement is a spontaneous activity, and how it can be influenced by external factors like electric currents, temperature changes, and mechanical or chemical stimuli. The author also explains how protoplasmic movement is similar to the irritability of muscle, and how it can be observed in various organisms, including Amoebae and plant cells.
