tldr: This study investigates the absorption coefficient for slow electrons in the vapors of mercury, cadmium, and zinc. The researchers found that the absorption coefficient decreases when the voltage is increased beyond the ionization potential, and that the effect of positive ions on the emission of the filament plays a significant role in the phenomenon. The results provide insights into the behavior of electrons in metal vapors and their interactions with gas molecules.
