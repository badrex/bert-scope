semantic_tags:
  - Sugar Transport Proteins

tldr: The article discusses the homologous sugar transport proteins in Escherichia coli and their relatives in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The authors study the properties, substrate specificities, and aligned sequences of these proteins and compare them with their eukaryotic relatives. They also present a unifying model for the structure of these proteins in the membrane.
