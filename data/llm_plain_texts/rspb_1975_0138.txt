tldr: The study examines the ability of the intertectal neuronal connections in the visual system of amphibian Xenopus laevis to adjust to changes in the spatial relationship between the two eyes during different developmental stages. The research shows that the system can respond to eye rotations up to 180 degrees before stage 58, but loses this ability as the animal grows older. The findings suggest that this plasticity may play a role in normal development and could be influenced by a functional interaction between the environment and the developing brain.
