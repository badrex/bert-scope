tldr: This article investigates the occurrence of chemical reactions in supersonic expansions of gases into a vacuum, focusing on the implications for mass spectrometric sampling. The authors analyze the extent of hydration of ions in a flame and compare their findings with experimental determinations, providing insights into the potential falsification of measurements of chemical composition during sampling. The study has wider relevance and application to various gas-phase systems.
