tldr: This study investigates the thickening of turbulent boundary layers and the formation of'slugs' of vorticity in channel and pipe flows. The authors propose that fast-traveling zones of concentrated vorticity, governed by the nonlinear Euler equations, contribute to the thickening of the boundary layer. These zones also play a role in the formation of slugs of vorticity in channel and pipe flows. The study provides insights into the structure, scales, governing equations, and amplitude dependence of these concentrated-vorticity zones.
