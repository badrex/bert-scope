tldr: The authors conducted an experimental study of chaotic particle motion in a simple Stokes flow system. They constructed surfaces-of-section that exhibit a mixture of regular and chaotic particle motions, and observed complex deformations of line elements, such as 'whorl' and 'tendril' structures. These findings agree well with numerical computations and demonstrate the existence of Lagrangian turbulence in low Reynolds-number flows.
