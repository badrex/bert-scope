tldr: The callus model of plant flowering is studied in three tobacco varieties: photoperiodically neutral Trapesond, short-day Mammoth, and long-day Sylvestris. Stem calluses from these varieties form generative or vegetative buds depending on the plant's age and photoperiodic sensitivity. The callus model helps researchers understand the complex processes of plant growth and development, particularly the regulation of flowering. The differences in flowering regulation among the varieties are explained by the presence or absence of a basipetal physiological gradient of flowering ability and the way they form the hormone flowering complex.
