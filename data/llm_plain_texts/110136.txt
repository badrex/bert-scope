tldr: The author conducted experiments using a high-pressure machine to compress water and other fluids. They discovered that water can be compressed by 1/12 under 2000 atmospheres of pressure, and other fluids like acetic acid, air, and carburetted hydrogen undergo phase changes and liquefaction under specific pressures. This research provides insights into the behavior of fluids under extreme conditions.
