tldr: This article describes the photography and kinematographic demonstration of sound waves undergoing various transformations, such as reflection, refraction, and diffraction. The author uses improved apparatus and techniques to capture detailed images of sound waves and their interactions with different surfaces and lenses. These visualizations help illustrate complex wave phenomena and provide a better understanding of sound wave behavior.
