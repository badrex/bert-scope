tldr: The author, George Newport, examines the development and changes of the nervous system in the Sphinx ligustri, a type of moth, during its metamorphosis. The study provides insights into the arrangement and function of the nerves in the larva, pupa, and perfect states of the insect, contributing to the understanding of insect anatomy and neurobiology.
