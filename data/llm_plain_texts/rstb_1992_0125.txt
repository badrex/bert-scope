tldr: 'This article explores the role of calcium-regulated channels in the physiological activities of Characean cells, such as cytoplasmic streaming, membrane excitation, turgor regulation, and salt tolerance. The authors use model systems like tonoplast-free and plasma membrane-permeabilized cells to study the presence of voltage-dependent calcium channels in the plasma membrane and calcium-dependent ion channels in both the plasma membrane and tonoplast. Patch-clamp techniques are applied to plasmolysed protoplasts and isolated cytoplasmic drops to measure channel activities. The results suggest that calcium regulation of channels in both the plasma membrane and tonoplast may form the molecular basis for calcium-regulated physiological functions in characean cells.'
