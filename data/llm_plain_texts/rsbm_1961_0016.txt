tldr: 'Otto Renner was a botanist who made significant contributions to the fields of genetics and plant physiology. His work focused on the study of Oenothera, where he discovered the Renner effect, which explained the behavior of different complexes in hybrid species. Renner's research also involved examining the structure and germination of pollen grains, the growth of pollen tubes, and the development of the embryo sac and endosperm in plants.'
