tldr: This article discusses the use of experimental ecosystems to study the effects of pollutants on marine life and ecosystems. The authors describe various experimental methods, including single species studies and food chain studies, to assess the impact of pollutants on population levels and community structure. They emphasize the importance of understanding the resilience of ecosystems to various stresses, including pollutants, and the need for further research in this area.
