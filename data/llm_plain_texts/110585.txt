tldr: The article describes a new tide-gauge designed by T. G. Bunt and erected on the River Avon in Bristol. The tide-gauge measures the rise and fall of tides using an eight-day clock, a float, and a wheel connected to a counterpoise. The device records the tide levels on a rotating cylinder or paper, providing valuable data for coastal engineering and understanding tidal patterns.
