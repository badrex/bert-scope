tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the dissociation of gases, specifically iodine, bromine, chlorine, and nitrogen tetroxide, using electric discharge. The results showed that iodine undergoes significant dissociation, while bromine atoms combine quickly, making it difficult to detect dissociation. The experiments also demonstrated that chlorine and nitrogen tetroxide can be dissociated under certain conditions.
