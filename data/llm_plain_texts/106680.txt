tldr: The author presents a method to determine the value of a contingent reversion involving three lives in survivorship. The approach is based on real probabilities of life and can be applied to various problems related to survivorship between three lives. This method provides a more accurate solution for calculating the value of reversions in cases where expectations of life are not sufficient.
