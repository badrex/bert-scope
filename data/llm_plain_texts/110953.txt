tldr: The author, Robert Lee, conducted dissections on the uterus and heart to study the ganglia and nerves present in these organs. He found a striking similarity between the ganglia and nerves of the uterus and the heart. Additionally, he observed that the size of the ganglia and nerves in the left auricle and ventricle is more than double that of the corresponding parts on the right side. Two elaborate drawings accompany the paper to illustrate his findings.
