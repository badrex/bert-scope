tldr: This article introduces a class of convolutional codes with a trellis path uniqueness property, which allows for unique identification of all states traversed by the encoder during a specific interval. Additionally, the codes possess a predictive property that can be exploited in communication systems for tasks such as fading envelope prediction, equalization, and window-edge correction.
