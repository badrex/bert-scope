tldr: The authors present an iterative method for constructing the density matrix in self-consistent field theory, which involves only matrix algebra and approaches the accurate solution of Hartree-Fock equations with less computation. This method can be extended to include configuration-interaction calculations and provides a more efficient way to determine molecular orbitals in molecular theory.
