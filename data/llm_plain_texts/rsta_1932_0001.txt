  - Solid Lubricants
  - Capillary Pressure
tldr: The author investigates the properties of matter in a fourth state, known as the boundary state, and explores the concepts of capillary pressure, solid lubricants, and the limit of boundary lubrication. They also discuss the importance of surface chemistry, including polarisation and diachysis, in understanding the behavior of substances in this state.
