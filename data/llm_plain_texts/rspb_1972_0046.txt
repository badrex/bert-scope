tldr: The study investigates the process of heterocyst differentiation in blue-green algae, specifically Anabaena cylindrica. The researchers found that the cellular C:N ratio increased before the percentage heterocyst frequency and nitrogenase activity reached a steady value. The initial stages of differentiation were observed 24 hours after transferring the algae into nitrogen-free medium, and nitrogenase activity was detected when the first heterocysts were formed. The results suggest that nitrogenase synthesis in Anabaena cylindrica is associated with heterocyst formation, and the primary factor regulating both processes is the cellular C:N balance of the algae.
