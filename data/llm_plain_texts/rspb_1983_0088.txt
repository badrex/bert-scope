tldr: The study investigates the responses of retinula cells in a moth's superposition eye, providing insights into their electrical interactions and sensitivity. The research reveals that the moth's superposition eye has a wide dynamic range and can detect various light properties, such as polarization, color, and localization. These findings suggest that the eye's adaptive advantage lies in its ability to enhance inhibitory spatial and temporal interactions at the primary photoreceptor level, improving nocturnal vision.
