tldr: This article investigates the interior structure of the Earth and its surface phenomena, focusing on the relationship between the Earth's fluid nucleus and its solid crust. The author proposes a hypothesis that explains the Earth's figure and provides a basis for research into geological history. The study also explores the effects of pressures on the Earth's structure and the potential for fissures to form in the solid shell.
