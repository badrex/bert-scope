tldr: The author conducted experiments with a vacuum tube and a magnet to study the effects of magnetic fields on electric discharges. They discovered that a strong magnetic field alters the appearance of the discharge, causing a bright blue cone of luminescence and significantly reducing the internal resistance of the tube. The phenomenon occurs regardless of the magnet's polarity and is reversible upon demagnetizing the magnet. The author also observed similar effects with the tube in a horizontal position, but found no significant impact on the internal resistance.
