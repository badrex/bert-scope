tldr: The authors developed the ODESSA system, an Oceanographic Database and Environmental Satellite System Application, to analyze and compare oceanographic data from satellite-borne and in-situ sensors. The system processes satellite images and oceanographic data, allowing users to make meaningful comparisons between the two data sets. It is designed to be flexible and user-friendly, with a menu-driven interface and the ability to handle data from various sources. The system has applications in oceanographic modeling studies and in relating sea-surface temperatures to the three-dimensional water-column structure.
