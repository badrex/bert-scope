revised_title: 'Antioxidants and Target Deprivation-Induced Ganglion Cell Death in Chick Embryos'
semantic_tags:
  - Retinal ganglion cell death
  - Axotomy
  - Antioxidants
  - Oxidative stress
  - Neuronal survival
tldr: The authors studied the effects of antioxidants on retinal ganglion cell death in chick embryos after a contralateral tectal lesion. They found that antioxidants, such as N-t-butyl-a-phenylnitrone and N-acetyl cysteine, can reduce the number of pyknotic cells, suggesting that oxidative stress plays a role in target deprivation-induced ganglion cell death.
