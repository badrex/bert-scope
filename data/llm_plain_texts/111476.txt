tldr: The authors investigated the physiological effects of the Tanghinia venenifera, a poisonous plant from Madagascar. They found that the plant's poison has a paralyzing effect on muscles, nerves, and the heart. The poison acts similarly to the Upas Antiar but with slightly less potency. The study provides insight into the plant's potential dangers and its impact on the body's systems.
