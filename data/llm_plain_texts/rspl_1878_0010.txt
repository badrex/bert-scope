tldr: The authors conducted a study on the cortical lamination of the motor area of the brain, focusing on the ascending frontal convolution. They observed and described the different layers and cellular elements, including neuroglia corpuscles, perivascular cells, pyramidal cells, and large ganglionic cells. Their findings contribute to the understanding of the brain's structure and function.
