tldr: The author, Harry Lobb, conducted experiments on healthy and paralyzed muscles using electrical stimulation. He found that healthy muscles contract when a direct current is applied, while paralyzed muscles contract more vigorously. Lobb also discovered that after treatment with the continuous galvanic current, paralyzed muscles can regain their function and contract under the direct stimulus. This research provides insights into the treatment of paralysis and the understanding of muscle contraction.
