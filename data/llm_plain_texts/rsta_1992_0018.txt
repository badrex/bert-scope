tldr: This article explores the use of chaotic advection in engineering systems, specifically in cellular flows, to enhance transport processes such as heat transfer. The authors discuss various examples, including closed cavity flows, jet-induced flows, and flows down a backward step, and analyze the effects of chaotic advection on these systems. They also propose future research directions and potential applications of chaos-enhanced transport in engineering.
