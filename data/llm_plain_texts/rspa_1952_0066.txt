tldr: The authors studied the copolymerization of styrene and sulphur dioxide, creating a wide range of copolymers. They found that the minimum styrene to sulphur dioxide ratio in polymers prepared by free radical polymerization is 2:1, which they interpret as copolymerization of styrene and a 1:1 styrene/sulphur dioxide molecular complex. The authors also investigated the polymer composition's dependence on styrene and sulphur dioxide concentration and temperature, discovering practically zero activation energy for the addition of the complex to a styryl radical.
