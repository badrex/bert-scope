tldr: The author presents a method to determine the elastic field of an ellipsoidal inclusion in an isotropic elastic solid. The method involves cutting, straining, and welding operations to find the stress and strain inside the ellipsoid. This solution is used to solve related problems, such as the disturbance of a uniform stress by an ellipsoidal cavity or the change in elastic constants of a material with the introduction of ellipsoidal inhomogeneities.
