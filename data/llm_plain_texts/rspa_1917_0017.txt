tldr: The author conducted spectroscopic observations on the active modification of nitrogen, focusing on the afterglow spectrum. They discovered that the intensity of certain groups of bands, known as the ft and y groups, is enhanced when oxygen compounds are present in the nitrogen. The author also investigated the effects of introducing various oxygen-containing gases into the afterglow, finding that this development is strong in all cases.
