tldr: This article explores the harmonic double cusp, a real singularity in catastrophe theory, and its relationship to caustics in optics. The authors describe the bifurcation set and umbilic locus, providing a tableau of two-dimensional sections over a three-dimensional base to understand the geometry of the harmonic double cusp and its connection to optical caustics from liquid drops.
