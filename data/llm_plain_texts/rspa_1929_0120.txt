tldr: The authors studied the dissolution process of unimolecular films in alkaline solutions, focusing on palmitic acid films. They found that the rate of dissolution increases with the alkalinity of the solution and temperature. The stability of the film depends on the formation of a close-packed double layer of orientated molecules, which protects the film from dissolution. The authors also observed that the residual film consists of an elementary bimolecular leaflet containing both palmitic acid and sodium palmitate.
