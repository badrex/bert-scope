tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the temperature dependence of the surface resistance of single crystal specimens of tin and tin-indium alloys to investigate the anisotropy of the energy gap in superconducting tin. They used a resonator with a single crystal or polycrystalline wire of tin as the main conductor and microwave power supplied by harmonic generation. The results showed that the energy gap in superconducting tin is anisotropic, with different values for different crystal orientations.
