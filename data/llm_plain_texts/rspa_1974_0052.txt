tldr: This study investigates the mutarotation of biologically important 2-substituted hexoses, focusing on the catalytic effects of various substances like water, hydronium ion, acetate ion, acetic acid, pyridine, and 3-hydroxypyridine. The researchers found that the mutarotation reaction likely occurs through a concerted mechanism involving two or more water molecules in the transition state. The findings provide insights into the behavior of amino sugars and their importance in metabolism.
