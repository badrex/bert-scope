tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the nucleus and crystallization of supersaturated saline solutions. They discovered that only a salt of the same kind as the dissolved salt can act as a nucleus to cause crystallization. The author also found that certain oils, when added to supersaturated solutions, can cause the solutions to crystallize, providing a new process for studying the nucleus effect.
