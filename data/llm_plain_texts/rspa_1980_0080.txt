tldr: The authors develop a model based on recovery-controlled creep to describe the behavior of materials after a stress reduction at high temperatures. They test the model using experimental data from a nickel-base alloy and provide an objective method for measuring friction stress. The results indicate the existence of a finite friction stress and support the use of the model for predicting creep behavior in various materials.
