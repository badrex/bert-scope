tldr: The author, Charles C. Christie, documented the appearance and behavior of the Aurora Borealis on November 18, 1835. He observed the arch-like structure of the phenomenon and the various colors and movements of the lights. The author also discussed the possible relationship between the luminous matter of the aurora and the dark cloud beneath it, suggesting that they might be two different substances interacting in the atmosphere.
