tldr: The author conducted experiments on fish to understand the relationship between spinal marrow and heart action. They found that when the spinal marrow is destroyed, the fish's muscles lose all power of action. The heart's action continues even after the spinal marrow and brain are destroyed, and longer when the brain is removed without injury. The study suggests that the spinal marrow plays a crucial role in the fish's body functions.
