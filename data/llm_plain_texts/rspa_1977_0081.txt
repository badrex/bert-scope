tldr: The authors prove the existence of a unique conserved stress tensor in two-dimensional quantum theory of massless scalar and spinor fields. They demonstrate that the stress tensor can be determined without regularization, and the results agree with earlier calculations using point-splitting regularization. This study contributes to understanding quantum vacuum stress and conformal anomalies in curved space-time.
