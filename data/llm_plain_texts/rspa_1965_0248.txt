re-establish equilibrium among the phonon modes. The full Callaway model incorporates both resistive and processes, and it is this combination that leads to a finite mean free path for all phonons and avoids the divergence of the long-wavelength phonons.

In this work, the thermal conductivities of eight lithium fluoride crystals with isotopic contents ranging from 10% to 90% have been measured between 1 and 300 K. The results show a strong effect of isotopes on the thermal conductivity, particularly at low temperatures. The full Callaway model has been used to calculate the predictions of the theory, and the experimental observations on the purer crystals confirm the distinctive behavior predicted by the model.

The discrepancies between the experimental results and the predictions of Klemens's and Ziman's theories are also discussed. The extension of the measurements down to 1 K has helped in the comparison with theory, as only boundary scattering, isotopes, and processes are important in this temperature range. The ability to predict the change in conductivity produced by the systematic introduction of defects with known scattering cross-sections, such as isotopes, is a decisive test for any theory of thermal conductivity.

In conclusion, the thermal conductivity of a dielectric crystal is determined by a combination of scattering processes to which the phonons are subject. The full Callaway model, which incorporates both resistive and processes, has been used to explain the experimental results and predict the behavior of thermal conductivity in lithium fluoride crystals with varying isotopic contents. The model's predictions have been confirmed by the experimental observations on the purer crystals, and the discrepancies with other theories have been discussed.
