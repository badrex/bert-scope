tldr: This study presents isopollen maps for the British Isles 5000 years ago, showing the major tree pollen types before the onset of forest clearance by Neolithic man. The maps reveal the natural forest patterns and help detect the major patterns of covariance within the pollen data. The findings provide insights into the British Isles' vegetation before human disturbance became an important ecological factor.
