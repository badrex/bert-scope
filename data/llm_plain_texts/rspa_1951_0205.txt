tldr: This study investigates the adsorption of water vapor on solid surfaces using two experimental methods. The results suggest that the previously observed heavy adsorption is due to contamination, and the adsorption of water vapor is similar to that of organic vapors, showing no anomaly. The authors emphasize the importance of clean surfaces in obtaining accurate adsorption measurements.
