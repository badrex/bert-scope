tldr: The authors investigated the hyperfine structure of certain Hg I lines using an electrodeless discharge. They analyzed the line 4916 A and other mercury lines to understand the differences in the structures recorded by various observers. The study helps in determining the nuclear moments of different isotopes of mercury and provides insights into the hyperfine structure of Hg I lines.
