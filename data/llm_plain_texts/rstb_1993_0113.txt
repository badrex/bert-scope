tldr: This article examines Cretaceous phytogeography and climate signals, focusing on the impact of the rise in angiosperm diversification on the climate signal offered by non-angiosperms. The authors analyze plant productivity, vegetation types, and the relationship between plant distributions and climate during the Cretaceous period. They also discuss the use of plant physiognomy as a tool for interpreting climatic signals and the challenges of calibrating non-angiosperms to climate.
