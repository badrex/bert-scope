tldr: This article investigates the longitudinal magnetoresistance of metals under varying magnetic fields and scattering conditions. The author explores different models of the Fermi surface and scattering functions to understand how the relaxation time assumption may lead to incorrect results, particularly when the Fermi surface is multiply connected. The study focuses on the longitudinal magnetoconductivity with the magnetic field parallel to the electric field, revealing the importance of understanding the effects of different types of orbits and scattering processes on the metal's conducting properties.
