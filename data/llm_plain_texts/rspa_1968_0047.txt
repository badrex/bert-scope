tldr: The study investigates the development of erosion damage in metals, such as copper, lead, and stainless steel, caused by repeated impacts of liquid droplets. A laboratory erosion apparatus is used to observe the structural changes and weight loss in the materials. The research also explores the influence of surface profile on erosion rate and the effect of droplet size and impact velocity on the damage process.
