tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine if electrical energy is produced when organic compounds are broken down through the fermentative activity of yeast and bacteria. They used a galvanic cell setup to measure the electrical potential generated by the microorganisms' chemical actions. The results showed that electrical energy was indeed produced during the fermentation process, with the voltage increasing as the concentration of glucose solution and the amount of yeast added increased.
