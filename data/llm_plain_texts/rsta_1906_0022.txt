tldr: The author discusses the spectrograms of the chromosphere obtained during three total solar eclipses in 1900, 1901, and 1905. They measured the wave-lengths of the spectra and identified the elements present in the chromosphere, such as titanium, chromium, scandium, yttrium, iron, manganese, and zirconium. The study provides valuable insights into the composition and behavior of the sun's atmosphere.
