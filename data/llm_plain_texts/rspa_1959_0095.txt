tldr: The authors investigated the domain structure in hematite using the electron beam method. They discovered a magnetic field structure consistent with a domain structure, with larger spacing than expected. The study focused on the behavior of this magnetic field in hematite crystals that undergo a transformation below room temperature. The findings provide insights into the properties of hematite and its magnetic behavior.
