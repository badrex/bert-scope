tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the absorption spectra of rubidium (Rb I) by exciting a single 3p electron and simultaneously exciting two electrons. They observed new resonances and absorption lines, and used Hartree-Fock calculations to propose identifications for these resonances. The results confirmed previous observations and provided insights into the behavior of Rb I's electronic structure.
