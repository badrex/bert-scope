tldr: The article discusses multiple-beam interference microscopy, a technique that enhances the contrast of images by modifying the phase and amplitude of diffracted beams. It compares this method to two-beam interference and phase-contrast microscopy, explaining how multiple-beam interference can accurately measure phase differences within objects. The article also explores the theoretical aspects of imaging phase gratings using multiple-beam interference microscopy.
