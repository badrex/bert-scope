tldr: This article presents the experimental methods used to study the refractive dispersion of organic compounds, focusing on cyclohexane and benzene. The authors developed an interferometric method to measure the refractive indices of thin liquid films, allowing for accurate readings in both visible and ultra-violet regions. They also discuss the limitations and improvements made in their measurements, as well as the potential for further research in this area.
