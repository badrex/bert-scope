tldr: This study investigates the effects of surface tension and non-uniform wall temperature on filmwise condensation on vertical ellipsoids and spheres. The research provides analytical expressions for local film thickness and heat transfer coefficients, showing that these parameters significantly affect local heat transfer coefficients. The findings can be useful in improving heat transfer processes in engineering applications.
