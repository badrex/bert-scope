tldr: The authors study the valence bands in two-dimensional graphite using group-theoretical treatment and idempotent operators. They classify the one-electron eigenstates and derive Bloch orbitals for the crystal valence bands. The deduced band structure consists of three touching bands, fully occupied by electrons in the normal structure. This research affects previous discussions of soft-ray experiments and provides insights into the properties of single-layer graphite.
