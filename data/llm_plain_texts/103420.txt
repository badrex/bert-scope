tldr: The author, Samuel Cruwys, describes an Aurora Borealis event observed in Devonshire. The phenomenon consisted of a bright, expanding body of lucid vapor, with streaming lights of various colors and shapes. The event lasted for about 25 minutes, after which dark clouds and a snowstorm followed. This phenomenon is now known as the Northern Lights and is caused by charged particles from the sun interacting with Earth's magnetic field.
