tldr: Dr. Wallis discusses the generation of hail, thunder, and lightning, proposing that they are caused by a mixture of nitre and sulphurous vapors in the air, similar to the reaction in gunpowder. He also suggests that the large size of hailstones may be due to their continued freezing during their fall, and that further research into these natural phenomena is needed.
