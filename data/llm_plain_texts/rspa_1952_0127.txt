tldr: This study investigates the initiation, burning, and thermal decomposition of gunpowder, focusing on the factors contributing to its sensitivity. The authors found that initiation is due to the formation of local hot spots, which can be formed by adiabatic compression of air pockets, friction of grit particles, and other ways. The necessary temperature for these hot spots is relatively low, but it is sufficient to melt the sulfur. The study also examines the growth of explosion from these initiation centers and the chemical processes involved in the early stages of decomposition.
