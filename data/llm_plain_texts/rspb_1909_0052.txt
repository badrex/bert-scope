tldr: The author conducted a series of experiments to compare the physiological effects of alcohol, ether, and chloroform on isolated frog muscles. The study found that alcohol, ether, and chloroform all have different effects on muscle contractions, with alcohol having the least impact and chloroform having the most significant impact. This research provides valuable information for understanding the comparative power of these narcotics and their potential applications in medicine.
