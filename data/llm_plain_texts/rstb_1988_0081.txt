tldr: 'This article discusses the role of glycosyl phosphoinositides in hormone action and their involvement in transmembrane signaling. The authors describe the enzyme-modulating substances, inositol phosphate-glycans, which are produced by the insulin-sensitive hydrolysis of glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (glycosyl-PtdIns) precursors. These substances regulate various enzymes and may play a role in reducing cAMP levels. The article also highlights the diverse group of proteins anchored to the plasma membrane via glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol.'
