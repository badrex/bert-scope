tldr: The author investigates the effects of pressure on the magnetisation of cobalt and discovers that cobalt exhibits opposite phenomena to iron when exposed to magnetic fields. The critical field for cobalt is found to be higher than that for iron, and the author discusses the significance of these findings in relation to previous research on magnetism and pressure.
