tldr: The authors conducted research on the chemical composition of narcotine and its products of decomposition. They discovered new compounds, such as methyl-noropianic acid and monomethyl-normnal meconin, by heating narcotine with hydrochloric or hydriodic acid. These findings contribute to the understanding of the chemical structure and properties of narcotine and its derivatives.
