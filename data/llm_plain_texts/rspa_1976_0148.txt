tldr: This article discusses the theory of rubber elasticity using both the dynamical approach of Boltzmann and the thermodynamic approach of Gibbs. The authors argue that these approaches can be valuable in studying rubber elasticity and provide a deeper understanding of the problem. They also explore the molecular dynamics of polymers and the challenges associated with the non-linear nature of the Boltzmann equation.
