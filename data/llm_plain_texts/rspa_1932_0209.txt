tldr: The authors explore the internal conversion of gamma rays, studying the probability of electrons being ejected from an atom's inner shell when a gamma ray is absorbed. They compare the effects of dipole and quadripole fields on the conversion coefficient and discuss the implications for nuclear theory.
