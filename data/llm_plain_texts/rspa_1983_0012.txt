tldr: This article explores conserved quantities of spinning test particles in general relativity. The author introduces new variables and a transformation to simplify the equations and separate trivial conserved quantities from non-trivial ones. The study focuses on the quadratic case and demonstrates that a reduced form of the equations exists, which implies the existence of a quadratic first integral. The findings have implications for understanding the behavior of spinning test particles in the context of general relativity.
