tldr: This study investigates the meiotic duration in wheat genotypes with and without homoeologous meiotic chromosome pairing. The researchers found no correlation between meiotic time and the amount of homoeologous chromosome pairing, casting doubt on the idea that the time available for pairing is limiting. They also discovered that individual wheat chromosomes have different effects on meiotic duration.
