tldr: The authors conducted a series of experiments to investigate the behavior of quadrant electrometers, specifically focusing on Sir William Thomson's bifilar suspension quadrant electrometer. They discovered that the irregularity in the action of the electrometer was due to the electric action of the guard tube on the needle. As a result, they developed an improved unifilar quadrant electrometer with enhanced performance and accuracy.
