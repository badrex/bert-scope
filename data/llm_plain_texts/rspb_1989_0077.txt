tldr: This study examines the crystallography and morphology of barium sulphate crystals produced by various desmid species, which are microscopic green algae. The research explores how the external aqueous environment affects the development of these crystals and compares the morphologies with synthetic crystals produced under similar conditions. The findings suggest that the ionic environment plays a significant role in crystal formation and may provide a diagnostic for the local environment within the cell.
