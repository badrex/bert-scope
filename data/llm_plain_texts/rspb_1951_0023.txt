revised_title: 'Behavioral Patterns and Tube Irrigation in Sabella Species'

tldr: The study investigates the behavior and tube irrigation patterns of Sabella spallanzanii and S. pavonina, two species of polychaete worms. The worms drive water currents through their tubes, which vary according to specific patterns. The differences in tube form and irrigation behavior are correlated with the worms' ecological preferences and habitat conditions. The research provides insights into the physiology of these worms and their unique feeding and respiration methods.
