tldr: The author conducted a study on the development of semilunar valves in chick embryos, observing the process of the truncus arteriosus dividing into the aorta and pulmonary artery. The study provides insights into the formation and development of semilunar valves and their connection to the division of the truncus arteriosus. This research contributes to understanding congenital malformations of the heart and sheds light on the similarities between bird, mammalian, and human heart development.
