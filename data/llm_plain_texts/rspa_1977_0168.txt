tldr: This article presents a method to derive expressions for the elastic constants of non-piezoelectric crystals by calculating the change in energy density when subjected to uniform strain. The authors develop a general approach that considers the initial stress and body torques, resulting in a more comprehensive understanding of the elastic constant tensor and its symmetry relations.
