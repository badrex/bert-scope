tldr: The authors conducted an experiment to study the scattering of alpha particles by helium to understand the energy levels of the nucleus 8Be. They measured the differential cross-section for the helium elastic scattering at various beam energies and calculated phase shifts for each energy. The results confirmed the existence of a previously suggested level with an excitation energy of about 10.2 MeV in 8Be and provided insights into the behavior of other levels.
