tldr: The authors conducted experiments on monkeys and anthropoid apes to study the variability of cortical responses. They discovered that the same point in the motor cortex can yield different responses due to factors such as variations in narcosis, blood supply, and temperature. This research sheds light on the complex workings of the nervous system and the underlying physiological conditions of "will."
