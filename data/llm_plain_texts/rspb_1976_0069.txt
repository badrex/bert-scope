tldr: The study investigates the effects of altered thyroid status on the electrogenic transfer of valine across rat jejunum. Hypothyroidism induced by various methods significantly increased the electrogenic valine transfer, while thyroid hormone treatment reduced the elevated values. The results suggest that electrogenic valine transfer is a more sensitive index of change in thyroid status than the conventional measure of total body oxygen uptake.
