tldr: Dr. Perrot Williams dissected the body of a person who had suffered from kidney stones for seven years. He found six smooth oval stones in the bladder and three cells in each kidney with shapes matching the stones. The ureters were unusually extended, allowing the largest stone to pass from the kidney to the bladder. This study provided insights into the anatomy and pathology of kidney stones.
