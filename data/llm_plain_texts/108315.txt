tldr: 'James D. Forbes investigates the plasticity of glacier ice and its role in glacier motion. He observes that glaciers move faster at the center than at the sides, suggesting that the ice behaves plastically rather than rigidly. Forbes also discusses the role of crevasses, the system of transverse fissures in glaciers, and how they affect the movement of the ice.'
