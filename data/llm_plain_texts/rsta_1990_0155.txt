tldr: The authors developed a simple method for urinary acylcarnitine profiling using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS) to diagnose inborn errors of metabolism, such as medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency, and to study drug metabolism. This method can help identify specific acylcarnitines in urine samples, providing valuable information for understanding various diseases and drug metabolic routes.
