tldr: This paper presents the lunar-diurnal variation of magnetic declination and the horizontal and vertical components of the magnetic force, based on a seven-year series of photographic records from the Kew Observatory. The author, Edward Sabine, demonstrates a lunardiurnal variation in these elements and suggests that this variation is likely due to the direct magnetic action of the moon. The results show similarities with other locations in the middle latitudes of both hemispheres, indicating a possible connection between the moon's position and the earth's magnetic field. Sabine recommends further investigation into this phenomenon.
