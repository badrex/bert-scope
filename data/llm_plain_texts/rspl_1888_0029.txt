tldr: This study investigates the effect of finely divided particles and pressure on the evolution of gases from homogeneous liquids. The authors found that the addition of inert particles increases the rate of gas evolution, and the rate decreases proportionally to the use of mass. The results are explained using a hyperbolic curve and the law of equivalent masses acting upon one another.
