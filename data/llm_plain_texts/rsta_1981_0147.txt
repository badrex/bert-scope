tldr: The authors conducted a ground-based experiment to detect gamma-ray bursts at gigaelectronvolt energies. They concluded that either there are no gamma rays at megaelectronvolt energies in these bursts or the bursts must have pulsations or very short durations to be detected. This study contributes to the understanding of gamma-ray bursts and high-energy gamma rays in the universe.
