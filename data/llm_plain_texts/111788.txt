tldr: The author examines the distribution of perihelia and nodes of known planets to determine if there is a pattern or law governing their positions. They find that a significant number of perihelia and nodes fall within specific heliocentric semicircles, suggesting the existence of an undiscovered law. The author invites further analysis to explore this phenomenon.
