tldr: This article discusses the causes and modeling of data-scatter in high-temperature mechanical properties, specifically focusing on creep and low-cycle fatigue. The authors explore the origins of data-scatter, including material-induced scatter and testing-induced scatter, and present advances in predictive modeling to address these issues. They provide a material model and fracture criterion to predict testing-induced interlaboratory scatter for nickel-base superalloys and discuss the implications of data-scatter for structural design and materials selection.
