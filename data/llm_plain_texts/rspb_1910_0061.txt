tldr: The authors conducted a study on the Bovey lignite deposits to determine their true age and flora. They found that the lignite was highest Oligocene or lowest Miocene, contrary to recent text-books and maps. The study also revealed a considerable number of species, mainly identical to well-known plants of the lignite of the Wetterau, which is generally classed as Upper Oligocene.
