tldr: The authors conducted a comparative study of the rates of evaporation of water from wool, sand, and clay. They found that the evaporation rates were influenced by factors such as the chemical and physical properties of the materials being dried. The study also revealed that wide differences exist in the evaporation of water from different types of soil, which is dependent on the colloid properties of clay.
