tldr: The author investigates the relationship between turacin and turacoporphyrin to the colouring matter of the blood. They discovered that turacin, a copper-containing pigment, exhibits an absorption band similar to that of hematin compounds, suggesting a close relationship between the two. The study also found that turacoporphyrin, obtained by removing copper from turacin, is similar to the body resulting from the removal of iron from hematin.
