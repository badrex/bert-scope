tldr: In this letter, Sir Robert Sibbald shares his observations and findings of various shells in Scotland. He describes the unique features and colors of different types of shells, such as Patellae, Trochi, Cochlea, Nerita, Pectines, and Pholas. He also mentions the presence of a curious barnacle with eggs found in its tail. Sibbald hopes to send more samples to Dr. Martin Lister for further study.
