tldr: This study investigates the corrosion resistance of various types of steel, including the effects of different elements and their potential for corrosion in both acidic solutions and atmospheric conditions. The authors found that the electrical method provided a more accurate estimate of corrosion resistance compared to the acid method. They also discovered that certain alloys, such as high chromium and silicon iron alloys, have higher resistance to corrosion.
