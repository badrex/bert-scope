tldr: The authors investigated the convergence of peripheral afferent fibers in the nervous system and their potential role in referred pain. They conducted experiments on rats using intracellular recordings and fluorescent tracers to study the branching of these fibers. Their findings suggest that dichotomizing peripheral afferent fibers could, at least in part, explain the phenomenon of referred pain.
