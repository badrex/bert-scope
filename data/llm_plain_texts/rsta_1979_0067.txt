tldr: The authors study the effects of internal gravity wave packets on mean flows in a stably stratified fluid with a horizontal shear flow. They use the generalized Lagrangian mean formulation to calculate the mean flows induced by wave packets and describe applications of their general theory, such as the propagation of internal gravity waves over varying bottom topography.
