tldr: This article presents an investigation of the friction between surfaces in motion at low speeds. The authors designed a unique apparatus to measure the friction between various materials as the velocity decreased from approximately 1 to 0.3 feet per second. They found that in cases where static friction significantly exceeded kinetic friction, the kinetic friction gradually increased as the velocity diminished, suggesting a continuity between the two types of friction.
