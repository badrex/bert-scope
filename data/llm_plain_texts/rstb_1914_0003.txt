tldr: The author presents an automatic method for investigating the velocity of transmission of excitation in mimosa plants. They use the Resonant Recorder to obtain accurate time intervals and confirm the excitatory nature of the transmitted effect. The author also discusses crucial tests, such as physiological blocks and the effect of localized poison applications, to determine the transmission of excitation in plants.
