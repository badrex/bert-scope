tldr: The author investigates the catalytic activity of copper in the formation of acetaldehyde from ethyl alcohol. They find that the initial activity of freshly prepared copper remains constant for at least an hour, but the activity decreases with use. The author also explores different methods of depositing copper on a catalyst surface and concludes that metallic copper, not reduced from its oxide, has no dehydrogenating effect, even when alloyed with zinc.
