tldr: The article introduces a new filter called the asymptotic filter, which is computationally tractable and performs better than the extended Kalman filter. The asymptotic filter has a guaranteed level of performance and is based on the theory of asymptotic expansion of integrals of Laplace type. The filter approximates the optimal probability density function by the product of a gaussian function and a linear function, which is chosen to provide a performance guarantee. The filter updates the approximating function to account for the state evolution and incorporate new measurements.
