tldr: The authors studied the morphological and protoplasmic features of two coccolithophorids, Hymenomonas roseola and Cricosphaera carterae. They discovered that the tremaliths in Hymenomonas roseola are modified scale rims, similar to the placoliths of Coccolithus pelagicus and the cricoliths of Cricosphaera carterae. They also found unique protoplasmic features in both species, such as peculiarities in the haptonema, pyrenoids, and flagellar roots, which are relevant to taxonomy.
