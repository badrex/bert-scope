tldr: 'This article explores how trees, as modular organisms, respond to the presence of neighboring modules, both of the same and different species. The author discusses the various ways trees interact with each other, such as through resource depletion zones and the hierarchy of dominance-suppression. The importance of recognizing neighboring modules and their effects on growth and form is emphasized for both modular animals and plants.'
