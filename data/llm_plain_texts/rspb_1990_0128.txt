tldr: This study investigates the photoperiodic control of reproduction termination in Japanese quail. Researchers found that short days cause a gradual dissipation of the long-day refractory state, allowing the birds to respond to daylength changes. The results show that short days are effective in causing gonadal regression and decreasing the size of the cloacal gland, which correlates with levels of luteinizing hormone secretion.
