tldr: The author, George Oakley Fleming, observed the lumbar division of the spine in birds and found that it allows for lateral flexion, contrary to the prevalent opinion among comparative physiologists. He also discussed the variations in the number of articulations in different birds and the structural adaptations that prevent flexion in the mesial plane.
