tldr: This article discusses the use of diamond-like carbon (DLC) thin films for various applications, including optical, mechanical, electronic, and biomedical uses. DLC films are grown under ion bombardment and have properties similar to diamond, making them suitable for protective coatings and anti-reflection coatings on materials like germanium. The article also explores the development of GeC, a durable coating material that can be used in multilayer structures with DLC.
