tldr: The author investigates the use of osmium in tissue fixation and staining, discovering that osmium binds to unsaturated fatty acids and can be used to visualize fat droplets, mitochondria, and other structures in cells. By using alkyl esters of gallic acid, the author develops a method for staining fat droplets and mitochondria, providing a new histological procedure that contrasts with traditional methods based on nucleic acids and proteins.
