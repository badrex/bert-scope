semantic_tags:
  - Group Theory
  - Representation Theory
  - Symmetry in Physics
  - Quantum Mechanics
  - Subgroup Properties
tldr: This article explores the restriction of irreducible representations of groups to a subgroup, deriving equations for the number and character of the representations of the subgroup. The author also discusses the properties of subclasses and their relevance to symmetry problems in physics, particularly in quantum mechanics.
