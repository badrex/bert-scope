tldr: The authors studied the intensities of electron diffraction rings formed when a beam of fast electrons passes through a polycrystalline film. They investigated the theoretical aspects of scattering by small crystals and discussed the conditions under which the Laue theory can be applied. The results can be used to understand the behavior of electrons in crystals and improve the understanding of material properties.
