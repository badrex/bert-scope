tldr: The authors studied the succinic dehydrogenase-cytochrome system, an intracellular respiratory system that catalyzes the aerobic oxidation of succinic acid. They found that this system behaves similarly to the natural respiratory system of cells, showing high catalytic activity and being affected by inhibitors in the same way. The efficiency of this system depends on the integrity of its components and the colloidal structure that supports them. This system is particularly important in skeletal muscles, heart muscles, and the brain's grey matter.
