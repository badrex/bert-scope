tldr: This study investigates the elastoplastic response and hardness of poly(methyl methacrylate) when subjected to indentation using rigid conical and spherical indenters. The authors describe an experimental and analytical method to measure the reaction force and contact compliance, allowing them to deduce the material properties, such as the Young's modulus and yield stress, which are consistent with data obtained from conventional mechanical testing methods.
