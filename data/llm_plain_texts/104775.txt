tldr: 'The author, Wm. Watson, conducted experiments to further understand the nature and properties of electricity. He discovered that electricity can counteract and overcome the force of gravity, and that it has some properties in common with magnetism and light. Watson also observed the differences in the appearance and behavior of electrical fire from different substances and discussed the penetration of electrical power through various materials.'
