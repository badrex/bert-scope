tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the total photo-electric emission of electrons from metals when exposed to different temperatures and radiation frequencies. They found that the amount of thermionic emission was much higher than the total photo-electric emission, which led to a better understanding of the differences between thermionic and photo-electric phenomena. This research helped to strengthen the radiation theory of thermionic emission.
