tldr: The authors describe a new method for measuring the energies of y-ray spectra using a y-ray spectrograph. They detect the Compton recoil electrons produced by the radiation using Geiger-Muller counters, which allows for more accurate estimation of the energies and relative intensities of the component radiations. The technique is tested with a thorium active deposit and found to be effective in measuring y-ray energies and analyzing complex radiation spectra.
