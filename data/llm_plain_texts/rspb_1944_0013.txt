tldr: The authors conducted experiments with two insects, Lasioderma serricorne and Sitodrepa panicea, to study the role of intracellular symbionts in their vitamin requirements. They found that these symbionts supply vitamins of the B group, which are essential for the growth and development of the insects. The study also demonstrated that the requirements of B-group vitamins differ between insects with and without intracellular symbionts.
