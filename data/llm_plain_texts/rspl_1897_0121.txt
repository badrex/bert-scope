tldr: This paper presents two parts, with Part I focusing on finding steady values of alternating currents in various circuits by performing integrations and simplifying equations. Part II explores the effects of higher harmonics and frequencies on the impedances and reactances of circuits. The paper assumes electromotive forces and electric potentials can be represented as simple sine or cosine functions of time.
