tldr: The article discusses the study of photoinitiated H-atom reactions in weakly bonded complexes, focusing on the entrance channel stereospecificity. The authors found that broadside H-atom approaches in HBr complexes are favored over end-on approaches, leading to different reaction probabilities. This striking steric effect is explained by the anisotropic intermolecular force field binding the complex, resulting in a specifically aligned precursor geometry. The results are interpreted in terms of entrance channel stereospecificity influencing chemically distinct product channels.
