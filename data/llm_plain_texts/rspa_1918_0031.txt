tldr: This article investigates the fundamental properties of textile fibers, such as wool and cotton, and their behavior under stress. The authors discover that these fibers exhibit plasticity and internal stresses when dry, but become elastic when placed in cold water. They also find that heat and moisture can affect the fibers' properties and behavior.
