tldr: This article explores the behavior of rotons in liquid helium using quantum hydrodynamics. The authors analyze the Hamiltonian obtained by Ziman and Thellung for an ideal liquid and find that the roton rest energy is proportional to the inverse of the sound velocity and the ninth power of the wave number cut-off. They also discuss the interaction between phonons and rotons and the implications for the excitation spectrum of liquid helium.
