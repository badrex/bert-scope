tldr: 'The author introduces a new technique for performing electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) experiments using pulsed electron spin echoes. This method does not depend on achieving a balance between relaxation rates and has been applied to study the Ce-W system in (Ca, Ce) at very low radio frequencies. The technique offers advantages over conventional methods, such as independence from lattice relaxation and freedom from control by unknown material parameters.'
