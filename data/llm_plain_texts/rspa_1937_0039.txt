tldr: The author investigates the continuous absorption spectrum of bromine and discovers strong evidence of magneto-ionic effects in the ionosphere. These effects are attributed to electrons rather than heavy ions. The study also provides further evidence of a thin layer of electrons at the ionosphere's level and finds that the polarization of echoes is elliptical, in accordance with Baker and Green's theory of limiting polarization.
