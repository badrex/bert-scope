tldr: The authors investigated the photo-induced co-oxidation of liquid benzaldehyde and decanal mixtures to understand the kinetics of the reaction. They found that both aldehydes are involved in a single kinetic chain, and by analyzing the aldehyde ratio during oxidation, they determined the relative reactivity of the two aldehydes to a given peroxy radical. This study provides insights into the oxidation of multi-component systems and the reactivity of radicals and dissimilar radicals in chain processes.
