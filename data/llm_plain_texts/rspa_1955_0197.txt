tldr: This article discusses the possibility of a photon having a finite mass and its implications on electromagnetic waves. The authors analyze Proca's field equations and show that by extending them to the interior of matter, the discontinuity between Maxwell's limiting case and a finite rest mass can be avoided. They argue that a finite rest mass would result in a third state of polarization for electromagnetic waves, which could affect the heating and pressure effects of black-body radiation. However, they conclude that the current findings indicate that we are not faced with the limiting case of rest-mass zero, and a more in-depth analysis of the interaction between matter and the mysterious vector field is needed.
