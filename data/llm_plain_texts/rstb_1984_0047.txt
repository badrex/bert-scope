tldr: 'Magnetotactic bacteria, such as A. magnetotacticum, can precipitate iron oxide minerals like Fe304 within their cells. This process involves the reduction of a hydrous ferric oxide precursor and is controlled by the bacteria. The iron oxide particles, or magnetosomes, are arranged in chains that function as a biomagnetic compass, allowing the bacteria to navigate along magnetic field lines.'
