tldr: 'Percy Williams Bridgman was a renowned experimental physicist who made significant contributions to the fields of high-pressure physics, compressibility, phase transitions, and solid-state physics. He invented self-tightening joints and pressure-measuring devices to study the thermodynamic properties of liquids and solids under extreme pressures. His work led to the discovery of new allotropic forms of ice, the understanding of the behavior of various materials under pressure, and the development of theories on the nature of liquids and solids.'
