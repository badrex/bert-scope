tldr: A farmer named Tho. Burrat reported an unusual event that occurred on March 8th, 1749. He heard a noise similar to thunder, followed by the ground shaking beneath him. He observed trees trembling and crows flying away in fear. This event happened without any visible lightning or cloud presence. The noise and shaking lasted for more than a minute, and it was felt in different locations. Tho. Burrat's account suggests a possible earthquake, but further investigation is needed to confirm this hypothesis.
