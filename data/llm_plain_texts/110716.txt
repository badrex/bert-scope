tldr: The author, C. Wheatstone, describes the electro-magnetic clock, a revolutionary timekeeping device that eliminates the need for traditional clock parts. The clock uses an electro-magnet and a constant voltaic battery to create a circuit that periodically makes and breaks, allowing the second, minute, and hour hands to move simultaneously. This invention offers improved accuracy and cost-effectiveness compared to independent clocks.
