tldr: The authors investigated incidents of unusual mortality in the common frog (Rana temporaria) in Britain and found two main disease syndromes: skin ulceration and systemic haemorrhages. The bacterium Aeromonas hydrophila was isolated more frequently from haemorrhagic frogs, while an iridovirus-like particle was identified in skin lesions from frogs with both syndromes. The study suggests that primary iridovirus infection, with or without secondary bacterial infection, may cause natural outbreaks of a disease called "red-leg."
