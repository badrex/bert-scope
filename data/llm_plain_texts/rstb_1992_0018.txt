tldr: This study examines the ultrastructure of the spermatozoa of the tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus) and compares it with other reptiles, birds, and mammals. The tuatara's unique sperm structure shares many features with crocodiles and turtles, but lacks advanced characteristics found in other lizards. This research not only confirms the primitive nature of living tuatara but also challenges the close relationship between Sphenodontida and Squamata.
