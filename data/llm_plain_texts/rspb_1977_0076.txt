tldr: This study investigates the effects of oscillatory movements on vision by imposing sinusoidal, triangular, and square-wave movements on a stabilized image. The results show that movement has two main effects: increasing fluctuations of illuminance in receptors near the boundary and decreasing visibility, presumably due to blurring. The response to movement is limited by photon noise for frequencies above 0.1 Hz, while lower frequencies are limited by other processes. The findings contribute to our understanding of visual perception and eye movements.
