tldr: The author, John Payne, describes a new invention that uses expanding fluids to create an elastic impelling force for powering hydraulic and other engines, such as fire engines. By rarefying water into steam, this method improves efficiency and reduces the amount of coal needed for the same amount of work. This innovation can be applied to fire engines, raising water and other uses.
