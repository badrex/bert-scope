tldr: This article investigates the spatial structure of rainfall from a stationary storm event using point process techniques. The authors develop a model for the spatial distribution of rain-producing cells and analyze the probability distribution of rainfall depth at a point. They consider different mechanisms for the spatial occurrence of rain cells, such as independent locations and dependent clustered locations, and explore various spread functions to describe the decay of rainfall depth with distance from the cell center. The results provide a framework for interpreting complex observational data related to storm rainfall.
