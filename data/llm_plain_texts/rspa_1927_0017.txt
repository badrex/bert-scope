tldr: The author presents a new method for measuring the relative intensities of spectrum lines using a neutral wedge and a ruled glass plate. This technique allows for more accurate and efficient measurements, especially in complex and faint spectra, without relying on density measurements or complicated instruments. The method is demonstrated using a continuous spectrum and a helium spectrum, providing a more reliable way to determine the true relative intensities of spectral lines.
