tldr: This article explores the relationship between DNA methylation and gene regulation, specifically focusing on CpG islands in genes with tissue-specific expression. The authors find that tissue-specific genes often have methylation-free clusters in their promoter regions, suggesting that methylation may play a role in controlling gene expression patterns. They also discuss the potential involvement of transcription factors, such as Spl, in protecting CpG islands from methylation and regulating gene expression.
