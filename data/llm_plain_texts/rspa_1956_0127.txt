tldr: This article discusses the vertical distribution of water vapour and ozone in the atmosphere, focusing on the lower stratosphere. The author suggests that the dryness of the stratosphere is due to air passing through the cold region of the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere near the equator, where water vapour condenses and falls out. The author also proposes that water vapour diffuses upwards and ozone diffuses downwards in the atmosphere, with slow sinking of very dry air from the stratosphere into the troposphere in middle latitudes.
