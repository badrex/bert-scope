tldr: This collection of abstracts discusses various scientific studies, including the examination of hydrocarbon flames, the effect of surface on combustion, the development of a sensitive method for detecting carbon dioxide in air, and the growth of nodule bacteria in legume roots. The research on combustion explores the role of surface deactivation and chain mechanisms in hydrocarbon oxidations. The carbon dioxide detection method is simple, accurate, and highly sensitive, allowing for the measurement of small amounts present in the air. The study on nodule bacteria investigates their growth in different legume root juices and their effectiveness in benefiting the host plant.
