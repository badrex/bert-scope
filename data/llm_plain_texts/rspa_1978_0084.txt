tldr: The authors report measurements of a high-frequency mode of oscillation in a current-carrying, bounded, thermally produced plasma. The oscillation occurs at approximately one-third of the electron plasma frequency. A linear theory is presented, predicting an instability at this frequency, and the calculated frequency of the instability agrees well with experimental observations. The electron velocity distribution function used in the analysis is a discontinuous Maxwellian.
