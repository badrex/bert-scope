tldr: This study investigates the reflection and refraction of elastic waves at the interface between two solids when they do not adhere, leading to localized separation. The research shows that the reflected and refracted waves undergo a phase shift, contain higher frequencies, and have their characteristics significantly altered. The gaps formed during separation are not symmetric in shape or location, and the normal tractions have jump discontinuities at the trailing edges.
