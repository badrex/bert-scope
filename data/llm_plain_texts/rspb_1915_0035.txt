tldr: This study investigates the rate of absorption of various phenolic solutions by barley seeds and the factors affecting the diffusion of aqueous solutions across semipermeable membranes. The research demonstrates that the rate of absorption is influenced by factors such as temperature, solute concentration, and the nature of the solute. The authors found that the membrane of the barley seed is permeable to all phenols, and the rate of absorption varies depending on the type of phenol. The study provides insights into the complex process of osmosis and the behavior of semipermeable membranes in plant physiology.
