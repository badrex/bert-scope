tldr: The article discusses gene transfer techniques into the germ line of mice and embryonal carcinoma stem cells. It explores the challenges and potential consequences of introducing recombinant DNA into these cells, including the possibility of developmental defects, sterility, and neoplasia. The authors also describe the use of embryonal carcinoma stem cells as vectors for introducing new genetic information into the germ line of mice, providing a powerful tool for studying gene expression during differentiation and development.
