tldr: The author discusses the function and location of enzymes in cells, particularly phosphatases, in relation to active transport and fibrous protein structures. They examine the techniques used to study enzyme localization and the potential issues with these methods, such as enzyme destruction during tissue section preparation and the diffusion of enzyme and end-products. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding these factors to accurately study enzyme localization and function in cells.
