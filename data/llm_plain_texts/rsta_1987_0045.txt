tldr: This article discusses the theoretical studies of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) stability in tokamak fusion reactors. It explores the current profile, safety factor, and energy principle in relation to stability. The article also presents the stability diagram of a low ohmic plasma and examines the effects of pressure and toroidal field on instabilities. The main focus is on understanding the operational limits and potential energy changes in a tokamak fusion reactor to achieve stable confinement of plasma.
