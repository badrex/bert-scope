semantic_tags:
  - Vaporization
  - Forces of attraction
  - Temperature effects
  - Condensation
  - Crystallization
tldr: This article discusses the existence of a limit to vaporization and the forces that govern it. The author explores the effects of gravity and temperature on vapor tension, and introduces the force of homogeneous attraction as a factor in condensing vapors. The author also provides examples of experiments with camphor and crystallization to illustrate these concepts.
