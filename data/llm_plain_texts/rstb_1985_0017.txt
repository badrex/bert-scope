tldr: 'The study investigates the signs of intelligence in cross-fostered chimpanzees, focusing on Washoe, who was raised in a human environment and taught American Sign Language. The research demonstrates that chimpanzees can communicate information, use signs to refer to natural language categories, and understand basic aspects of language acquisition similar to hearing and deaf children.'
