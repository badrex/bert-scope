tldr: The authors studied the deviations of benzene vapour from ideality and its behavior under various pressures and temperatures. They used a differential compressibility apparatus to measure the isothermals of benzene vapour and found that the deviations were consistent with the law of corresponding states. This research aimed to establish a unique relationship between the reduced temperature and the ratio of the virial coefficient and the critical volume, providing a better understanding of benzene's thermodynamic properties.
