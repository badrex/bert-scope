tldr: The author investigates the properties of ternary alloys and their critical curves, determining the conditions for the formation of stable homogeneous mixtures. They describe the triangular method of graphical representation and discuss the effects of temperature, solvent proportions, and the intermixture of metals on the formation of alloys. The study focuses on mixtures of lead, tin, and zinc, as well as bismuth, silver, and chloroform-acetic acid-water, providing insights into the behavior of these alloys and their potential applications in metallurgy and chemistry.
