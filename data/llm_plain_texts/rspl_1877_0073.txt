tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the electric discharge using the chloride-of-silver battery and studied the striking-distance between different terminals in various gases. They observed different phenomena, such as the intermittent discharge, the length of the spark, and the influence of high potentials in inducing secondary currents and magnetism. The research also explored the effects of the discharge in rarefied gases and vacuum tubes.
