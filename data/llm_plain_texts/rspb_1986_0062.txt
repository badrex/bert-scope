tldr: The study demonstrates the existence of afterimage-like effects in the motion-sensitive neuron H1 of flies. These effects alter the sensitivity to movement based on the local stimulus history and can last for up to 2 seconds. The afterimage process could play an essential role in processing the low temporal frequency components of moving images, improving the understanding of motion-sensitive neurons' spatiotemporal function.
