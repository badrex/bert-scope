tldr: This study examines how individual investment in cooperatively breeding long-tailed tits, Aegithalos caudatus, varies with the number of carers. The research shows that males and females reduce their provisioning effort when aided by one helper, but do not further reduce it with additional helpers. The findings suggest that the presence of helpers influences parental provisioning rates and highlights the complex resolution of conflicts over investment in species with multiple caregivers.
