tldr: The author investigates the chemical nature of hemochromogen, a compound between the pigment and protein, and its carbon monoxide compound. They find that the iron compound of hematoporphyrin behaves like hematin, requiring a nitrogenous substance for the formation of hemochromogen. The study also shows that carbon monoxide-hemochromogen resembles carbon monoxide-hemoglobin more when a nitrogen compound is present.
