tldr: The authors present a direct and simple method to calculate the scattering power of a bare nucleus using wave mechanics. They replace spherical polar coordinates with paraboloidal coordinates to simplify the analysis. The scattering power is defined as the volume density of electricity in the scattered wave when the volume density of the incident wave is unity around the nucleus. The authors find that the scattering power of a bare nucleus is cosec, which is the classical value obtained by Rutherford.
