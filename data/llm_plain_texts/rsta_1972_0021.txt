tldr: This study investigates the correlation between D-region neutral gas winds, density changes, and short-wave radio-wave absorption. The authors conducted an experimental investigation using 26 Skua II rockets and found a significant correlation between air mass flow and radio-wave absorption in the D-region. The results provide insights into the atmospheric circulation and the transport of minor constituents in the D-region, which can help explain the winter anomaly of radio-wave absorption.
