tldr: The authors studied the influence of membrane potential on the conductance sublevels of chloride channels activated by GABA in cultured hippocampal neurons. They discovered that the number and amplitude of conductance levels change with the potential, and the spacing between levels varies linearly with potential. This finding supports a model of a channel composed of synchronized, non-rectifying conducting pores, where the number of pores activated changes with membrane potential.
