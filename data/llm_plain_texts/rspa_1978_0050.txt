tldr: This study investigates the hydration process of Portland cement using conduction calorimetry and electron microscopy. The research confirms that the hydration process involves two stages: the rapid initial formation of gelatinous hydrate coatings around cement grains and the growth of fine fibrillar calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H) gel material into a network between the grains after a dormant period. The study also highlights the importance of understanding the structure and physical nature of the C-S-H gel material, which forms the main bonding agent in hardened cement paste.
