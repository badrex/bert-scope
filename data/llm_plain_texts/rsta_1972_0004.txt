tldr: The authors study the structure of the Icelandic basalt plateau and the process of crustal drift. They find that the basalt pile is composed of large lenticular shield-like lava units, each related to its own feeding dyke swarm and resulting from a protracted period of fissure volcanism. The geophysical evidence suggests that the most important seismic discontinuity is the boundary between layers 2 and 3, which has been mapped over large areas of Iceland. The authors propose a crustal spreading model and discuss the implications for the formation of new oceanic crust.
