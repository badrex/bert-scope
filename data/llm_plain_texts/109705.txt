tldr: The author, William Herschel, investigates the cause of colored concentric rings and other related phenomena. He explains that these patterns are formed by critical separation of colors and the modifying power of the surfaces involved. The experiments conducted with prisms and different surfaces help to clarify the underlying principles of these optical phenomena.
