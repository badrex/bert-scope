tldr: The author, J. Norman Lockyer, conducted spectroscopic observations of the Sun and discovered new solar lines in the solar spectrum. These lines were found to be coincident with the Fraunhofer lines C and F, and were observed in solar prominences. The discovery of these new lines helped to understand the behavior of the solar spectrum and the nature of sunspots.
