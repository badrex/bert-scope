tldr: This article discusses the contributions of Maxwell, Jenkin, and Cotterill to the development of the theory of statically-indeterminate structures in civil engineering. It highlights how their work helped solve the problem of calculating forces within frame structures due to applied loads and how their methods and principles are still relevant today.
