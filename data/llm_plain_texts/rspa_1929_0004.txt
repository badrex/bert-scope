  - Air-blown particles
  - Surface charges
  - Electrical phenomena
tldr: This article investigates the tribo-electric effects and friction caused by air-blown particles, such as metal filings, sand, and ice. The author explores the charges generated on the particles and the surrounding air, and how these charges can be influenced by factors like temperature, speed, and surface materials. The findings provide insights into the complex interactions between particles and surfaces, and the potential applications in various fields, including engineering and environmental studies.
