tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine how the velocity of beta particles decreases as they pass through matter. They found that the absorption coefficient of the rays increases as they penetrate the absorbing medium, suggesting that the rays slow down when passing through matter. This study helps to explain the linear law of absorption observed in previous experiments.
