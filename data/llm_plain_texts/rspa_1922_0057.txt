revised_title: 'Molecular Structure and Properties of Thin Films: Condensed Films'
semantic_tags:
  - Thin Films

  - Intermolecular Forces
tldr: The authors investigate the properties and molecular structure of thin films, specifically focusing on condensed films. They study the forces acting on the films and the intermolecular interactions between the molecules. The authors also observe a change in the properties of the films at higher temperatures, which they attribute to the separation of molecules due to thermal agitation. This change results in films with properties similar to a gas or vapor in two dimensions.
