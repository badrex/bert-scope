tldr: This article investigates the coupling of physical, biological, and chemical processes associated with particle resuspension and seston flux in the North Sea. The authors studied three sites with different water column and seabed characteristics. They found that seston concentration was determined by local resuspension and advection of a regional horizontal concentration gradient. The resuspended particles were derived from a thin layer of material (fluff) on the seabed, which was relatively enriched in organic carbon. The authors also discovered that storm resuspension of fine sediments may be self-limiting due to self-stratification of the boundary layer by resuspended fine sediment.
