tldr: The author, Signor Carlo Matteucci, discusses his electro-physiological research on muscle contractions and the electrical phenomena involved. He refers to a recent publication by M. DLu Bois Raymond and shares his findings on the similarities between induced contractions and galvanoscopic frog contractions. Matteucci explains that these contractions produce electrical currents and demonstrate the production of an electrical disequilibrium during muscular contraction. He also explores the question of whether the cause of the discharge is a phenomenon similar to that of electrical fish or a change in the natural conditions of the muscular current.
