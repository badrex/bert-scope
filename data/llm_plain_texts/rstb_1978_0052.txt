tldr: This study investigates the geomorphology of 67 reef islands in the northern Great Barrier Reef, focusing on their topographic, lithological, sedimentological, and vegetational features. The authors categorize the islands based on topographic and vegetational complexity and discuss their development, influenced by factors such as rainfall, seabird nesting, and human disturbance. The research raises questions about the nature, origin, and history of specific island features like ramparts, beach ridges, boulder tracts, and exposed limestones.
