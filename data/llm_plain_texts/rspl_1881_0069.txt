tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the inhibitory nerves in the medulla oblongata and found that they have an inhibitory influence on the origins of vagus fibers that supply the oesophagus, the ends of vagus fibers that control respiration and heart movements, and the center in the medulla regulating blood vessels. This research shows that inhibitory excitations can extend to neighboring centers, and further studies on these inhibitory nerves may lead to interesting discoveries.
