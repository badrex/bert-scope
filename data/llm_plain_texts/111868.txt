  - India-Rubber
tldr: The author, George Gore, demonstrated how to prepare liquid carbonic acid in glass tubes and tested its chemical and solvent actions on various substances. He found that it is relatively inert, dissolves only a few substances, and has limited solvent power. It also has unique effects on gutta percha and india-rubber, which may have practical applications. Additionally, liquid carbonic acid is a strong insulator of electricity, similar to bisulphide of carbon.
