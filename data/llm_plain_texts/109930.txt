tldr: 'Dr. Alexander Marcet investigated the specific gravity and salinity of sea-water from various parts of the ocean. He found that the Southern Ocean is saltier than the Northern one, and saltiness generally decreases near land and in the presence of ice. Inland seas are usually less salty than the ocean. The author also studied the saline contents of different seas and discovered that they contain the same ingredients worldwide, with differences in specific gravity due to varying amounts of saline matter.'
