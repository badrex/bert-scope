tldr: The authors developed a heat switch mechanism to measure the lattice specific heats of substances at low temperatures. They used this technique to study potassium chloride, grey tin, and graphite, finding that their specific heats followed a T^3 relation at temperatures below about 60 K. The heat switch provided better thermal insulation and eliminated the need for exchange gases, improving the accuracy of the measurements.
