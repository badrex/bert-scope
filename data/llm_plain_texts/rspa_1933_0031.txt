semantic_tags:
  - Quantum mechanics
  - Chemical kinetics
  - Reaction mechanisms
  - Activation energy
  - Transition probabilities
tldr: This article explores the application of quantum mechanics to chemical reactions, specifically focusing on reaction mechanisms, activation energy, and transition probabilities. The authors compare classical mechanics and quantum-mechanical treatments, finding that the latter is necessary for accurate calculations involving hydrogen atoms or protons. They also discuss the potential discrepancies between experimental data and theories of reaction kinetics when using classical treatments.
