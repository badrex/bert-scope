tldr: The article discusses the protection against anthrax infection in pregnant women and their foetuses. It observes that a minimum of thirty-six hours of exposure to anthrax is required to protect the mother, while surviving foetuses may require a longer exposure or be protected if a period of six days has passed since the primary inoculation. The study also highlights the importance of proper inoculation techniques to prevent the mother from contracting the disease.
