tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the resolving power of photographic plates and discovered that the resolution depends on the amount of irradiation displayed by the plate. They found that irradiation is caused by two different forms of scatter: reflection and diffraction. The resolving power of photographic plates is likely to be much smaller than previously thought.
