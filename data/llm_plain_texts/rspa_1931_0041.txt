tldr: The author describes the development of a high-speed wind channel for research in external ballistics. The channel allows for the study of air resistance on projectiles at velocities greater than the speed of sound. The author discusses the design and construction of the wind channel, including the air compressing plant, nozzle, and balance used to measure the forces on a small-scale projectile model.
