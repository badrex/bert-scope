tldr: This article discusses the classification of pollutants and their pathways in the atmosphere. It highlights the importance of understanding the routes taken by pollutants to assess the damage they can cause and develop effective control methods. The authors propose a broad classification of pollutants based on local, regional, or global scales, associated with the terrestrial boundary layer, the troposphere, and the stratosphere, respectively.
