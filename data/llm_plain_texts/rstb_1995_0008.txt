semantic_tags:
  - DNA repair
  - Gene amplification
  - Tumour development
  - DNA damage response
  - Oncogenes
tldr: This article discusses the mechanisms of gene amplification in rodent and human cells, focusing on the role of DNA damage and repair pathways. It highlights the differences between rodent and human cells in the processes of amplification and resistance to antimetabolites. The article also explores the various mechanisms of resistance and the importance of understanding these processes in normal cells and tumor development.
