tldr: The author conducted experiments on the island and peak of Teneriffe to study the effect of altitude on respiration. They found that at higher altitudes, a greater amount of carbonic acid is formed in the body and exhaled. This discovery helps to understand how the human body responds to different altitudes and environmental conditions.
