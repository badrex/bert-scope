tldr: This study investigates the heat of occlusion of hydrogen and oxygen in platinum black. The authors found that 68.8 K (6880^-calories) of heat is evolved per gram of hydrogen occluded and 1100^-calories per gram of oxygen. The research also explores the possibility that the occlusion of gases and the formation of platinous hydrate may be related phenomena.
