tldr: The author, Francis Blake, investigates the optimal proportions for steam-engine cylinders, focusing on the relationship between the cylinder's altitude and base. He concludes that broader cylinders are more efficient, as they reduce friction and increase force. This improvement could lead to a more powerful steam engine.
