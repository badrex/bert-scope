tldr: The authors study the crystal growth of n-pentacontanol-1 from various polar and non-polar solvents using electron microscopy. They find that crystals grown from polar solvents show monomolecular growth steps, while those from non-polar solvents show a higher proportion of bimolecular growth steps. This supports the idea that step height is determined by the size of the associated group of molecules in solution. The authors also observe twin growth, habit modification, and polytypism in the crystals.
