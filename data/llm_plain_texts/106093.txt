tldr: The author, John Smeaton, describes the construction of a new hygrometer that can accurately measure the moisture content in the atmosphere. The instrument uses a flaxen cord impregnated with salt to detect changes in moisture levels. Smeaton also provides detailed instructions on how to build and adjust the hygrometer for precise readings. This invention aimed to improve the accuracy of moisture measurements, which was essential for understanding weather patterns and environmental conditions.
