tldr: This paper discusses the effects of thunderstorms and lightning discharges on the Earth's electric field. The authors conducted a series of observations using a capillary electrometer to record the potential gradient near the ground during thunderstorms. They found that the electric field produced at the surface of the Earth by a thunderstorm can vary rapidly through a great range of intensities, and the prevailing sign of the field changes due to lightning discharges is negative.
