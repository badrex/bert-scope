tldr: The authors analyze the orbital data of synchronous satellites, specifically Syncom 2 and Syncom 3, to study the longitude dependence of the geopotential. They use the observational data to determine the coefficients of the tesseral harmonics in the Earth's gravitational potential and discuss the limitations of their findings due to the lack of observations in certain longitudes. The study contributes to understanding the dynamics of nearly synchronous satellites and the forces acting on them.
