tldr: The author examines a species of Millepora found in Tahiti and describes its unique structure and growth patterns. The coral forms encrusting bases and has irregular tubercles and lobules on its surface. The calicles, or pores, are dispersed across the surface, and the corallum has a complex canal system that distinguishes it from other corals. The author also discusses the challenges of studying the soft structures within the coral and provides insights into the methods used for examining the coral's histology.
