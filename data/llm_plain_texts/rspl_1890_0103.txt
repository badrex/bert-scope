tldr: The author examines the uterine villiform papillae, or trophonemata, in various species of sharks and their role in embryo development. They describe the different functions of these structures, such as providing egg cases and forming a vascular connection with the embryo through the yolk sac. The author also discusses the secretion of a nutritive fluid by these papillae, which is either absorbed or ingested by the developing embryo.
