tldr: The authors studied the effect of dislocation movement on the kinetics of thermal decomposition of freshly cleaved calcite crystals. They discovered that the thermal history of the crystal significantly affects its reactivity, with two distinct patterns of behavior observed. The authors found that dislocations play a crucial role in the reactivity of the solid, with the change in the stereochemical environment of molecules in the dislocated region of the crystal being important.
