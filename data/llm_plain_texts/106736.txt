tldr: Olof Swartz introduces a new plant genus, Chloranthus, and describes its characteristics. The plant is native to China and has intricate construction. It is different from Viscum or Loranthus but shares some similarities. Swartz also distinguishes it from other plants like Tsjiulang or Camunium Chinense of Rumphius and Vitex pinnata of Linnaeus.
