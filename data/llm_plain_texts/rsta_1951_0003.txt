tldr: This article presents a new method for evaluating complex integrals in molecular theory, which is essential for understanding molecular structure. The authors introduce a technique using functions and expansions to simplify and break down integrals, making them more manageable for calculations. This technique is particularly useful for one-electron overlap and resonance integrals, two-electron Coulomb and hybrid integrals, and penetration integrals. The authors also discuss alternative methods and their limitations, ultimately recommending their new approach as the most efficient and practical method for evaluating molecular integrals.
