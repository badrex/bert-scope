tldr: The author, Charles Hatchett, examines the magnetical pyrites, a type of iron sulfide, and its magnetic properties. He describes its physical characteristics, such as color, fracture, and magnetic power. Hatchett also provides details of his chemical analysis, which reveals the composition of the pyrites, including the percentage of iron and sulfur. The author concludes that the iron in the magnetical pyrites is almost in the metallic state and that the pyrites contain a small amount of oxygen combined with the iron.
