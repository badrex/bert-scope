tldr: The author observed various biological structures using a microscope, including blood, milk, hair, and lice. They discovered that blood and milk are made up of small globules, hair grows through the protrusion of these globules, and lice have a unique way of ingesting blood. These observations provide a deeper understanding of the microscopic world and the anatomy of living organisms.
