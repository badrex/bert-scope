tldr: This lecture by J. Burdon Sanderson explores the relationship between respiratory movements and the circulation of blood. Through various experiments, he found that each expansion of the chest increases arterial tension and shortens the diastolic interval, leading to an increase in both the force and frequency of the heart's contractions. This challenges the common belief that inspiration causes a decrease in both.
