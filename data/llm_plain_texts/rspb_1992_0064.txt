tldr: The authors attempted to localize the mechanoelectrical transduction channels in mammalian cochlear hair cells using immunocytochemistry. They found that the channels are most concentrated just below the tips of the shorter stereocilia, coinciding with a region of specialization in the closely apposed membranes of the short and tall stereocilia. This discovery helps to determine the precise location of the channels in relation to the hair bundle, which is essential for understanding how stereociliary displacement operates these channels.
