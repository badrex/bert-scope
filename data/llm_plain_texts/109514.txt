tldr: Charles Hatchett conducted experiments on various species of Zoophytes, which are marine animals, to analyze their chemical composition. He discovered that their essential ingredients include carbonate and phosphate of lime, combined with different modifications of a gelatinous or membranaceous substance. This research also led to a better understanding of the properties and origins of substances like albumen, gelatin, and animal fiber.
