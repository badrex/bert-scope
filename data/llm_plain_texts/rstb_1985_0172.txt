revised_title: 'Oxidative Stress and Its Impact on Cellular Thiols and Calcium Homeostasis in Mammalian Cells'
semantic_tags:
  - Oxidative stress
  - Cellular thiols
  - Calcium homeostasis
  - Mammalian cells
  - Menadione toxicity
tldr: The article investigates the effects of oxidative stress on mammalian cells, specifically focusing on the depletion of cellular thiols and perturbation of calcium homeostasis. Exposure to toxic levels of menadione leads to the formation of oxygen radicals, oxidation of thiols, and disruption of intracellular calcium levels, which can result in cell death.
