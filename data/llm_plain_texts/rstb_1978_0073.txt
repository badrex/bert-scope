tldr: The study examines the shell microstructure of the bivalve mollusc Ptychodesma knappianum, providing insights into the evolution of the Pteriomorphia subclass. The shell structure consists of three layers: outer prismatic, middle nacreous, and inner complex crossed lamellar. The findings support the hypothesis that modern arcoids and pterioids evolved from nacro-prismatic cyrtodontid ancestors, with adaptations for shell durability and effective closure along the shell margins.
