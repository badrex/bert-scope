tldr: This article discusses the use of physico-mathematical models for numerical weather prediction on a global scale. It assesses the accuracy of predictions in relation to observational data and the representation of physical and dynamical processes in the models. The concept of predictability in atmospheric disturbances is also explored, with the potential for extended forecast ranges and confidence ratings based on model divergence. The article highlights improvements in forecast accuracy and the limitations of current models, particularly in tropical regions.
