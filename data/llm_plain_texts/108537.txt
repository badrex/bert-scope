tldr: The author investigates periodical laws in magnetic disturbances and finds a correlation between the frequency and magnitude of disturbances and solar spots. The study examines disturbances of magnetic declination at Toronto and Hobarton from 1843 to 1848, revealing a connection between the disturbances and solar activity. This connection has implications for understanding the Earth's magnetic field and the behavior of the sun.
