tldr: This article discusses the role of Escherichia coli molecular chaperones, including DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE, in the process of DNA replication. The chaperones are involved in protein folding and refolding, DNA and RNA synthesis, proteolysis, and other cellular processes. The authors describe the molecular mechanisms of these chaperones and their interactions with the preprimosomal complex during DNA replication.
