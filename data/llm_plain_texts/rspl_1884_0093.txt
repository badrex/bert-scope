revised_title: 'On the Peculiar Behaviour of Glow-Lamps and the Edison Effect'
semantic_tags:
  - Edison effect

  - Resistance
tldr: This article discusses the behavior of glow-lamps when raised to high incandescence, focusing on the Edison effect and the relationship between the lamp's resistance and electromotive force. The author observes a critical point where the lamp's resistance increases, and the shunt's resistance diminishes, indicating a change in the state of the carbon filament. This change is an indication of the lamp's disintegration and potential rupture.
