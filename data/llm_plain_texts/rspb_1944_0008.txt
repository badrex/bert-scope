tldr: The article demonstrates a method to represent the shape of a human being as a function of time using a continuous one-parameter set of transformations. The method involves analyzing plane drawings of the human body at different stages of development and applying mathematical transformations to calculate the rate of change in shape from the 5th month of fetal life to maturity.
