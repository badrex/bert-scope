tldr: The authors developed a fundamental kinetic model to predict soot formation rates from gaseous hydrocarbons. The model considers five main processes: gas-phase reactions, nucleation, coagulation, growth, and oxidation. The authors applied the model to a practical rocket engine and found that their predictions agreed with experimental results. This new approach can be used to identify rate-controlling processes and key intermediate species in soot formation.
