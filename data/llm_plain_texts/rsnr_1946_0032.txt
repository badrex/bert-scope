tldr: This article pays tribute to Charles Stewart Middlemiss, a geologist who was also an accomplished artist. It highlights his painting of the Chor Mountain and discusses his contributions to the Geological Survey of India, where he was required to illustrate his reports with drawings and sketches. Middlemiss's artistic talent was so exceptional that he did not need to rely on photographs, as was the option for those who were not skilled in drawing.
