tldr: The article discusses the search for general characteristics of invading species and their genetic attributes. It explores the connection between polyploidy and colonizing ability, as well as the importance of considering the entire genetic system. The author emphasizes that successful invaders may have genetic characteristics that allow them to rapidly expand in new environments, but these characteristics are not consistent across all species. The article also highlights the limitations of general theories derived from studies of colonizing species and the need for further research in this area.
