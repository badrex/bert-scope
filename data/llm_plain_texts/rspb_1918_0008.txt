tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of inorganic catalysts and colloidal aggregation on photosynthesis. They discovered that certain inorganic compounds, such as iron and uranium salts, can act as energy transformers when exposed to sunlight. The authors found that the size of the solution aggregate plays a crucial role in the efficiency of the photosynthetic reaction. Their findings suggest that inorganic catalysts are necessary for photosynthesis and that the energy of sunlight is converted into chemical energy at the surface of the colloidal aggregate.
