tldr: This article reviews experiments on lepton and baryon stability, focusing on neutrino mass measurements, lepton flavor conservation, and neutrino oscillations. The author discusses various experiments and their results, including those on neutrino oscillations at nuclear reactors, pion factories, and high-energy accelerators, as well as oscillations of solar and atmospheric neutrinos. The article also covers nucleon decay experiments and the implications of these findings for gauge theories and particle physics.
