tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the fate of red blood corpuscles when injected into the circulation of another animal of the same species. They discovered that the injected corpuscles are treated as foreign and eventually disappear from the host's circulation. This research provided insights into the immune response during blood transfusion and helped determine the total volume of blood in the transfused animals.
