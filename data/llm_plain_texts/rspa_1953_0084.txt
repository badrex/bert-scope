tldr: Researchers improved the measurement of the fundamental vibration-rotation band of hydrogen chloride using higher resolving power and better instrumental advances. They determined the wave-lengths of absorption lines more precisely and resolved the isotopic splitting of lines. This provided new and more accurate values for rotational constants and centrifugal stretching terms for the two isotopic species.
