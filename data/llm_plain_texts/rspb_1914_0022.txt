tldr: The author's experiments on Gunda ulvacea, a Triclad Planarian, show that anterior regeneration is dependent on the presence of the central nervous system. The study also highlights the differences in regeneration capabilities between Gunda and other genera like Planaria, suggesting that the power of regeneration is determined by the growth and regeneration capacity of the central nervous system.
