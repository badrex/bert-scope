tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the rate constants for spin-orbit relaxation in curve-crossing collisions of excited lead atoms in flames. They found that the rate constant for relaxation by atomic hydrogen has a negative temperature dependence, while the rate constant for relaxation by bulk flame constituents has a positive temperature dependence. These findings provide insights into the behavior of excited lead atoms in flames and the underlying mechanisms of curve-crossing processes.
