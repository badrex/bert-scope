tldr: The authors discovered a latitudinal gradient in the density of human languages in North America, with six times more languages spoken in southern latitudes compared to the poles. They also found that the geographic range of human language groups increased with latitude, conforming to Rapaport's rule. This study sheds light on the ecological factors associated with linguistic and cultural evolution.
