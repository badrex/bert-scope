tldr: This article discusses the effects of strain on the microstructures, fabrics, and deformation mechanisms in quartzites. The author examines the development of microstructural features, such as undulatory extinction, deformation bands, and sub-grains, and how they relate to dislocation sub-structures. The study also explores the role of dynamic recovery and recrystallization in steady-state deformation and the impact of strain on the properties of quartzites.
