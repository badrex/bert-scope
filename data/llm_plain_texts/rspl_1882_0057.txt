tldr: The author examines the connection between the state of the sun's surface and the Earth's magnetism. By comparing daily changes in the Earth's horizontal magnetic force with the sunspot activity during 1844 and 1845, the author finds a correlation between high sunspot activity and increased Earth's magnetic force, and vice versa. This study suggests that changes in the sun's surface may affect the Earth's magnetic field.
