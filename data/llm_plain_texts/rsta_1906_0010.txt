tldr: 'The author, Sir William De W. Abney, improved the apparatus for measuring colour and its application to determine colour sensation. He made modifications to the colour-patch apparatus, allowing for better comparison of spectrum colours and the addition of white light. Abney also investigated the presence of a fourth colour sensation in the violet, concluding that it does not exist and can be explained by the overlapping of the three primary sensations. The revised apparatus and methods allowed for more accurate measurements of colour sensations in the spectrum.'
