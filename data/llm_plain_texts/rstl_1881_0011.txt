tldr: The author describes the remains of the gigantic land-lizard (Megalania prisca) found in Australia. The remains include parts of the armor of the tail, which had large, sharp, and strong processes that could have been used for both offense and defense. The author compares the tail-armature of this extinct lizard to that of a small Uromastix, a type of lizard from Zanzibar, and discusses the similarities and differences between the two.
