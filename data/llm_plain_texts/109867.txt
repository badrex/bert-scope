tldr: The author, A. P. Wilson Philip, explores the use of galvanism in treating respiratory diseases, particularly asthma. He found that applying galvanic current through the chest could provide relief to patients suffering from asthma. The treatment involves using a battery with metal plates, one placed on the nape of the neck and the other on the pit of the stomach, to send the galvanic fluid through the chest. The treatment is most effective in cases of uncomplicated asthma.
