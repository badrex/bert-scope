tldr: The authors investigated the size of the trachea in warm-blooded animals, including guinea pigs, rabbits, and ptarmigan, and found that the tracheal area increases more slowly than body weight. They determined that the tracheal area is related to body weight, body surface, blood volume, and aortic size. The study provides insights into the respiratory system's structure and function in different warm-blooded animals.
