tldr: This article investigates the effect of shear on the crystallization and melting of micellar solutions, specifically focusing on diblock copolymer polystyrene-b-ethylene-co-propylene in -dodecane. The authors found that shear-induced crystallization and melting can be observed in these micellar solutions, and they used small-angle neutron scattering and rheological techniques to study the structural changes and organization of the micelles under different shear conditions. The results provide insights into the behavior of sterically stabilized systems and the role of shear in inducing long-range order in micellar solutions.
