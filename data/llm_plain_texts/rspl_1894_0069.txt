  - High Temperatures and Pressures
tldr: The authors conducted experiments with modern explosives, specifically smokeless gunpowders, to study their chemical reactions at high temperatures and pressures. They measured the heat evolved by explosion, the quantity and composition of gases produced, and the actual temperature of explosion using photographic means. The research aimed to contribute to the understanding of explosives in general and the development of modern smokeless gunpowders.
