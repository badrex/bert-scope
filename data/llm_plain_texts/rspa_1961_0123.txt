tldr: This article presents a systematic investigation of cyclotron resonance in germanium over a wide temperature range. The authors explore the temperature dependence of collision processes and the effects of impurities on cyclotron resonance absorption. They find that between 20 and 300Â°K, lattice wave scattering is the dominant relaxation process, and the collision times derived from cyclotron resonance are in good agreement with corresponding mobility values. The results provide insights into the transport phenomena in semiconductors and metals, contributing to the understanding of the behavior of charge carriers in magnetic fields.
