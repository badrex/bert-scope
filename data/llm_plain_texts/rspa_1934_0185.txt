tldr: This article investigates the kinetics of the reaction between hydrogen and nitrous oxide under various conditions, including different pressures and the presence of oxygen. The author finds that the reaction is a chain process and provides a detailed analysis of the mechanism, including the effect of wall inhibition and gas phase termination. The results contribute to the understanding of the thermal hydrogen-nitrous oxide reaction and its potential applications.
