tldr: This study investigates the validity of Miner's cumulative damage rule in fatigue tests on fillet welded joints. Fatigue tests were conducted using simple loading sequences with constant amplitude load cycles and secondary load cycles of varying magnitudes. The results showed that in most cases, Miner's rule was unsafe, and an empirical equation was used to predict the remaining test results with reasonable accuracy. The study suggests a more accurate and practical approach to apply in practice for designing welded structures under variable amplitude loading.
