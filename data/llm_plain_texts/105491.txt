tldr: The author, Henry Cavendish, conducted experiments on factitious air and discovered that certain metals, like zinc, iron, and tin, produce an inflammable gas when dissolved in acids. He found that this gas is not affected by water or alcalies and studied its behavior when mixed with common air. His experiments contributed to the understanding of chemical reactions and gas properties.
