  - Contact transformation
  - Divergence-free equations
tldr: The authors introduce a new method for handling problems in quantum electrodynamics, focusing on a technique that uses expansions in powers of the high-frequency interaction. This method promises to be useful in applications to meson theory and aims to provide divergence-free equations of motion applicable to any problem. The authors also discuss the physical and heuristic ideas underlying the transformation method and its potential for practical use and approximate numerical calculations.
