tldr: The authors conducted microwave measurements to study the diffraction of a plane wave by a black half-plane screen. They compared the experimental results with two theoretical models, Kirchhoff diffraction and Sommerfeld diffraction, and found that the Sommerfeld model matches the experiment better on the source side. The study provides insights into the behavior of electromagnetic waves near highly absorbing screens and helps validate theoretical models for future research.
