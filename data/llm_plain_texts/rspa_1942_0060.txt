tldr: The authors conducted experiments on mild steel to study its atomic lattice behavior under compressive stress. They obtained a stress-strain curve for the atomic lattice, which showed three distinct phases of lattice behavior: expansion before yield, a permanent contraction at the yield point, and a consistent increase in permanent contraction with increasing stress. These findings provide insights into the mechanics of metallic lattices and their deformation under stress.
