tldr: The authors conducted kinetic studies on the primary photoprocesses in quinones and dyes, focusing on the quinone duroquinone. They investigated the kinetics of the semiquinone radical, semiquinone radical ion, and triplet state in various solvents and hydrogen-ion concentrations. The study provides a detailed understanding of the reaction mechanisms and rate constants involved in these processes.
