tldr: 'This study investigates the phosphate uptake by zooxanthellae isolated from corals, specifically Symbiodinium sp. from the coral Acropora formosa. The results show that the uptake follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a Km value of 14 pM. Preincubation of the zooxanthellae in the presence of 500 pM phosphate caused a significant decrease in uptake capacity, suggesting that they originate from phosphate-depleted environments. The findings support the depletion-diffusion hypothesis for nutrient uptake in zooxanthellate symbiosis.'
