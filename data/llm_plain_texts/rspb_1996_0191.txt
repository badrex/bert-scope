tldr: This study examines the relationship between the symmetry of cricket harps and the frequency characteristics of their songs. Researchers found that larger, more symmetrical harps produce lower frequency sounds with less modulation, which female crickets prefer. The results suggest that directional asymmetry in harps may convey reliable information about male quality through their songs.
