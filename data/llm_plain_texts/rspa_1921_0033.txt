revised_title: 'Influence of Low Temperatures on the Magnetic Properties of Iron-Nickel and Iron-Manganese Alloys'
semantic_tags:
  - Magnetic properties
  - Low temperatures
  - Iron alloys
  - Nickel alloys
  - Manganese steel
tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the magnetic properties of iron-nickel and iron-manganese alloys at low temperatures. They found that cooling the alloys to the temperature of liquid hydrogen or liquid helium could make them magnetic at room temperature. This research helped to understand the constitution of steel alloys and how their properties could be influenced.
