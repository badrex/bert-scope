tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effect of temperature on the rigidity of metals using a torsion-balance. They found that metals with lower melting points have a greater variation in rigidity with temperature. The author also discovered that metals have internal viscosity, which affects the measurements. The results show that the more fusible a metal, the greater the change in rigidity with temperature.
