tldr: The author presents a new electrical instrument for solving spherical triangles, which is designed for amateur yachtsmen and offers high accuracy. The instrument is based on Ohm's law and uses two potentiometers to calculate the required angles. It can solve any spherical triangle for declinations and latitudes up to about 80°, but its accuracy is limited for zenith distances less than 30°. This instrument is portable, lightweight, and can be used for navigation to the usual standards of accuracy.
