tldr: The authors studied the physiological effects of low atmospheric pressure on Pike's Peak, Colorado. They observed signs of acclimatization and various symptoms related to oxygen deficiency. The study found that adaptation to low barometric pressure occurs through increased lung ventilation, increased haemoglobin percentage in the blood, and enhanced secretory activity of the alveolar epithelium. Acclimatization takes several days to develop, which explains the difference in experiences between mountaineers and balloonists.
