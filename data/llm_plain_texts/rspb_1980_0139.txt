tldr: This article discusses the interaction between Agrobacterium Ti-plasmid DNA and plant cells. The Ti-plasmids are catabolic plasmids that force plant cells to synthesize specific compounds called opines, which the bacteria can then degrade. The transfer of Ti-plasmid DNA to plant cells leads to transformation and the expression of T-DNA genes, which intervene in opine biosynthesis. This process can be used as a vector for genetic engineering in plants, allowing the insertion of foreign DNA into the T-DNA for various applications.
