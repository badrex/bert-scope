tldr: Conwy Lloyd Morgan was a versatile scientist and philosopher who made significant contributions to the fields of comparative psychology, biology, and the philosophy of science. He is best known for his work on the concept of emergent evolution, which posits that evolution is not a steady, continuous process but is interrupted by the emergence of something new. Morgan's research on animal behavior and his philosophical ideas have had a lasting impact on the study of psychology and the understanding of the relationships between mind, life, and matter.
