tldr: This article discusses the role of interstellar molecules in understanding the rate of evolution in biological systems. It explores the possibility of complex organic molecules being formed in outer space and falling to Earth, contributing to the prebiotic environment. The study of these molecules may provide clues about the early stages of life's development and the factors influencing the evolutionary process.
