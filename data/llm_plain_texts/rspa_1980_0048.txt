tldr: The article investigates the diffraction of sound by a thin screen with circular apertures in the presence of a low Mach number grazing flow. It examines how the interaction of sound waves with the screen generates vorticity at the aperture rims, which is then convected away by the mean flow, leading to attenuation. The study provides a theoretical framework for predicting the optimal attenuation achievable from a screen under specific mean flow conditions.
