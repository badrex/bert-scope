tldr: This article explores the evolution of self-pollination in plants, focusing on the ecological factors and molecular genetic variation that influence the process. The authors discuss the automatic selection and reproductive assurance hypotheses, and present phenotypic selection models to examine the selection of floral traits promoting self-pollination. They also consider the role of neutral genetic variation in understanding the evolution of selfing in plants.
