tldr: In this letter, Anthony Leeuwenhoeck shares his microscopical observations of the structure of teeth and bones. Using improved microscopes, he discovered that teeth are made up of small, transparent pipes. He also observed similar pipes in bones, though they were less distinct due to the thickness of the bone. This research provided a deeper understanding of the composition of teeth and bones.
