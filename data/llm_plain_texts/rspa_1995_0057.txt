tldr: The authors present a new method for calculating internal displacement fields using X-ray computed tomographic images. They develop a nonlinear regression model and use a multiresolution algorithm to estimate the displacement field associated with permanent deformation in objects with complex structures. This method can recover the entire internal displacement field of a physical object under deformation by comparing tomographic representations before and after the deformation.
