tldr: The article presents a theoretical analysis of the flow of glaciers and ice-sheets as a problem in plasticity. The author assumes that ice has a constant yield stress and obeys the Levy-Mises equations of flow and either the Mises or Tresca criterion of yielding. The study calculates the stress and velocity distribution in a long slab of ice sliding down a rough slope and discusses the appearance of crevasses and shear faults in the context of the calculated stress distribution.
