tldr: The authors develop constitutive equations to characterize the multiple-slip behavior of crystalline materials at low temperatures. They propose a matrix of instantaneous hardening moduli that relate the rate of hardening on each slip system to all slip-rates, based on observations and experiments. The study presents simulations of various behaviors in single crystals (copper) that agree with observations, including stress-strain curves, hardening rate variations, latent hardening, tensile overshoot, and secondary slips. The research provides an analytical form for the evolution of the instantaneous slip-system hardening moduli, which can help predict the complex hardening behaviors of single crystals.
