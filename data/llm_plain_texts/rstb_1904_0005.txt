tldr: 'This study investigates the effect of environmental conditions on the dominance of characters in Echinoid hybrids. The author conducted experiments with sea urchins, observing the influence of factors such as temperature, time spent in tanks, and the treatment of eggs and sperm. The results showed that while environmental conditions can affect the form of the larva, there is no clear evidence of changes in dominance caused by these conditions.'
