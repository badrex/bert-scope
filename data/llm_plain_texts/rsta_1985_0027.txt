tldr: The article discusses the processes of organic matter decomposition, bacterial sulphate reduction, and pyrite formation in buried sediments. It explains how these processes vary in different environments, such as normal marine, euxinic, and freshwater sediments, and how they can be used to distinguish between these environments in ancient sedimentary rocks. The authors also highlight the importance of organic matter reactivity and burial rates in controlling the rate of sulphate reduction and pyrite formation.
