tldr: This article investigates the pharmacological properties of organic oximides, which contain the chemical group HZN'OH attached to a carbon atom. The author examines the actions of various oximides, aldehydes, and ketones on voluntary muscle, the spinal cord, and the heart. The results show that these substances have similar actions to nitrites, with primary stimulation followed by secondary depression. The author concludes that the structural relationship of the oximides is correlated with their pharmacology, and they may possess a pharmacological type that can be isolated and referred to the presence of the group N*OH.
