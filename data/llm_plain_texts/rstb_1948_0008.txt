tldr: This study investigates the influence of maternal physiology on the occurrence of diapause in insects. The author found that the age of the parent female and variations in her diet and temperature of development have significant effects on her offspring's tendency to enter diapause. The research focuses on two hymenopterous parasites and provides insights into the complex factors that can induce diapause, a state of reduced growth processes or maturation in insects. The findings contribute to the understanding of insect development and biological control methods.
