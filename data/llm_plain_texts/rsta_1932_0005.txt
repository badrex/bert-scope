tldr: The authors conducted a series of experiments to determine the colorimetric properties of the spectrum and the behavior of the human eye in measuring luminous intensity and color. They developed a color triangle and mixture curves to calculate photometric and colorimetric values of any stimulus from its spectral energy distribution. This work contributed to the understanding of color vision and colorimetry, which is essential for various applications in industries and commerce.
