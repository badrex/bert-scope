tldr: This article investigates the nonlinear development of a Stokes layer on an oscillating circular cylinder, focusing on the centrifugal instability. The authors find that nonlinear effects prevent the exponential growth of disturbances when the Taylor number exceeds a critical value. The flow obtained in the supercritical regime is synchronous with the basic flow, and an equilibrium amplitude solution exists in a supercritical neighborhood of the marginal configuration.
