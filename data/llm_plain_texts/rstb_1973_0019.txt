tldr: This article discusses recent advancements in the understanding of vertebrate smooth muscle physiology, focusing on the mechanism of muscle contraction. The authors present various perspectives on smooth muscle myosin, its differences from skeletal muscle myosin, and the role of soluble proteins like tropomyosin. They also explore the challenges in observing myosin filaments in muscle cells using electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction techniques.
