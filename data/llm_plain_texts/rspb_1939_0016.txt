tldr: The authors studied the properties and mechanism of cytochrome and cytochrome oxidase in heart-muscle preparations. They discovered that the absorption spectrum of reduced cytochrome in the preparation showed strong bands a, b, and c, and three Soret or y-bands. The addition of respiratory inhibitors like CO, KCN, and NaN3 caused changes in the absorption spectrum of cytochrome, revealing a new cytochrome component, a3. The study provides insights into the functioning of cytochrome and cytochrome oxidase in cellular respiration.
