tldr: The study investigates the increase in ventilatory capacity of normal subjects at high altitudes and its relation to mask design. It shows that the increase in ventilatory capacity is mainly due to a reduction in lung gas density. The research also describes an oxygen mask designed for climbers, which has a lower flow resistance compared to a low-resistance apparatus for measuring maximum voluntary ventilation.
