tldr: The author studied the spectrum of manganese to understand the regularities and series in its lines. They discovered new series and classified lines in the spectrum, providing insights into the atomic structure and the application of quantum theory. This work contributed to the understanding of the structure of atoms and the analysis of other complex spectra.
