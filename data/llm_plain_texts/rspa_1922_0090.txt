tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of temperature on the intensity of reflected X-rays in various crystals. They found that the intensity of reflection decreases as the temperature of the crystal increases, and this effect is more pronounced for higher order spectra. The results provide insights into the behavior of crystals and their applications in various fields.
