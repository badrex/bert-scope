tldr: In 1746, Dr. C. Mortimer studied a deadly cow distemper spreading in 18th century London. He observed the symptoms, the rapid progression of the disease, and the measures to prevent its spread. Mortimer suggested separating sick and healthy cows, forbidding the sale of live cows and calves at market, and keeping fat cattle away from others to stop the disease from spreading.
