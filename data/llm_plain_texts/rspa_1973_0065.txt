tldr: The article provides a proof that all little groups of the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs group are compact, determining the spins of the representations. It also examines the faithfulness properties of the representations and verifies Sach's conjecture that the'mass squared' is represented by a constant in B.M.S. representations. The article further investigates the restriction of the representations to the Poincare subgroup, showing that a mixture of Poincare spins is present in the representations, except for one case.
