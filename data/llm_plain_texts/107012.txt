tldr: 'In this 1795 study, Everard Home and Archibald Menzies dissected a sea otter to examine its anatomy. They described the sea otter's physical features, including its fur, head, eyes, ears, legs, tail, and internal organs. The authors also compared the sea otter's anatomy to that of a common otter and discussed the differences they observed.'
