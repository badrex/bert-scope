tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effect of surface brightness on the temperature of incandescent materials. They found that the temperature required to produce a certain level of light emission is higher when the surface is dull compared to when it is bright. This discovery has implications for the efficiency of light-giving sources, such as incandescent lamps.
