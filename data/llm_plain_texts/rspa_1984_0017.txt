tldr: The authors studied the precipitation of pairs of crystallographic shear planes in non-stoichiometric oxides using high-resolution electron microscopy. They found that these planes often occur in pairs and investigated the atomic mechanisms involved in their nucleation and growth. The results emphasize the influence of cooling history on the microstructures observed at room temperature and suggest that similar phenomena may be discovered in other non-stoichiometric chemical systems.
