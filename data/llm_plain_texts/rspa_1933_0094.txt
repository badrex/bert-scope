tldr: 'This article investigates the persistence of crystallization nuclei in molten metals, specifically bismuth, cadmium, lead, and tin. The experiments reveal a correlation between the degree of preheating and subsequent undercooling, with greater preheating producing greater undercooling. The study also shows that the time factor has little influence on the degree of undercooling, and the results suggest that the process of melting and solidification is more complex than previously thought.'
