tldr: This study investigates how chaotic population dynamics can arise from natural selection. The authors use mathematical models to analyze the traits of mutant populations and their invasion boundaries. They find that chaotic behavior can occur when certain conditions are met, such as when invasion boundaries are convex and have upsloping curves. This research contributes to our understanding of how complex population dynamics can emerge in nature.
