tldr: The authors conducted experiments on a young orangutan to study the effects of electrical stimulation on the motor cortex and internal capsule. They found that the orangutan's brain had distinct areas for motor function representation, similar to humans. The study provided insights into the localization of brain functions and the development of anthropoid apes.
