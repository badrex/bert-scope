revised_title: 'Endogenous DNA Damage and Its Impact on Genetic Information'
semantic_tags:
  - DNA repair
  - DNA damage
  - Genetic stability
  - Molecular biology
  - Mutation
tldr: The author discusses the intrinsic lability of DNA's covalent structure and its impact on genetic information. DNA is susceptible to endogenous damage, which can cause mutations and lead to human diseases. Despite the efficiency of DNA repair pathways, some forms of endogenous damage still result in genomic instability. The author highlights the importance of understanding DNA's structure and stability for the advancement of genetic knowledge.
