tldr: 'In this article, Michael Faraday investigates the magnecrystallic and diamagnetic forces in various media and temperatures. He uses a torsion balance to measure the force that solicits a crystal to retain its stable position of rest. Faraday examines the magnetic properties of bismuth and tourmaline crystals in different media, such as water, carbonic acid, and phosphorus, and discusses the effects of these properties on the surrounding environment.'
