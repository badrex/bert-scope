  - Comparative anatomy
tldr: The authors conducted experiments on nerve anastomosis, specifically focusing on the brachial plexus, to restore function in paralyzed muscles. They found that the brachial plexus in Macacus and humans are nearly identical, and that anastomosis can effectively restore function in paralyzed muscles. The time taken for restoration of function through anastomosis is similar in various animal models.
