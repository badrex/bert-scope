tldr: The article discusses the role of repetitive DNA in plant chromosome structure and evolution. It explores the mechanisms behind the amplification and distribution of repetitive DNA sequences, including tandem arrays and transposable elements. The author also examines the impact of these sequences on chromosome structure and the potential for selection to influence their distribution in plant populations.
