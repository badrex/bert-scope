tldr: This study investigates the effect of hydrogen ion concentration on the adsorption of weak organic acids and bases by pure charcoals. The authors found that the adsorption is significantly influenced by hydrogen ion concentration, with different acids and bases exhibiting varying degrees of adsorption. The results provide insights into the behavior of adsorbents and their potential applications in fields such as enzyme chemistry and vitamin studies.
