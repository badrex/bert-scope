revised_title: 'P-Adrenergic Agonists and cAMP: Their Effects on Intracellular Calcium Concentration in Ileum Smooth Muscle'

  - Adrenergic agonists
  - Cyclic AMP
  - Ileum
tldr: The authors discovered that P-adrenergic agonists, like isoprenaline, and an increase in cyclic AMP levels can lower the intracellular resting free-calcium concentration in ileum smooth muscle. This finding helps explain the relaxing effects of P-adrenergic agonists on smooth muscles, such as those found in blood vessels and the gastrointestinal tract.
