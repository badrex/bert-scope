tldr: This article discusses the determination of the ohm, the unit of electrical resistance, through an experiment conducted by Lord Rayleigh and Arthur Schuster. They used a method that involved causing a coil of wire to revolve and observing the deflection of a magnet due to the earth's magnetic force. The results aimed to provide an independent and accurate measurement of the ohm and address the uncertainties surrounding its value.
