tldr: This article studies the convective-diffusive-reactive transport of a chemically reactive solute in a general model of a multiphase system. The model considers ordered or disordered particles of arbitrary shapes and sizes, using spatially periodic boundary conditions to analyze particulate multiphase systems of effectively infinite size. The article focuses on describing the solute transport and reaction processes at a macro or Darcy-scale level, expressing the three macroscale phenomenological coefficients in terms of microscale data and geometry. The study reveals the competitive influences of volumetric/surface-excess transport and reaction processes on the macroscale transport coefficients.
