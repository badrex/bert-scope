tldr: 'Charles William Andrews was a prominent vertebrate palaeontologist who made significant contributions to the study of extinct birds, reptiles, and mammals. He worked at the British Museum (Natural History) and conducted research on various fossils, including those from Madagascar, New Zealand, Patagonia, and Egypt. Andrews' work laid the foundation for future research in vertebrate palaeontology and his descriptive catalogue of marine reptiles remains a valuable resource for scientists today.'
