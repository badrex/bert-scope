tldr: 'This article discusses the pathways and dispersion of lead from motor vehicle exhausts. It explores the chemical forms of lead emissions, the size and distribution of particles, and the factors affecting dispersion, such as wind, turbulence, and atmospheric stability. The study also examines the deposition of lead on roadside surfaces and its impact on the environment.'
