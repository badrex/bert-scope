tldr: The author, George Biddell Airy, presents a study of diurnal and annual inequalities of terrestrial magnetism observed at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, from 1858 to 1863. The study also investigates the lunodiurnal and other lunar inequalities in magnetism during the same period. The author finds that the magnetic action of the sun has increased, and the magnetic behavior has returned to its original character. The study provides insights into the relationship between lunar cycles and terrestrial magnetism.
