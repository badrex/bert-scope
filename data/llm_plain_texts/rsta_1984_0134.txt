tldr: The article discusses the relationship between optical bistability in a ring cavity tuned near resonance and multimode self-oscillation in a cavity tuned between resonances. It presents a stability analysis for a nonlinear ring cavity and demonstrates a one-to-one correspondence between these two phenomena. The study focuses on absorptive and dispersive bistability in a cavity containing a two-level homogeneously broadened absorber, with detailed results provided for the mean-field limit.
