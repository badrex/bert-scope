tldr: The author, John Bostock, studied the spontaneous purification of Thames water and found that the impure water, after some time, became clear due to a fermentation process. The foul water contained higher amounts of lime, sulfuric and muriatic acids, and magnesia. The author concluded that the organic substances, mainly of animal nature, deposited in the Thames, were responsible for this depuration process.
