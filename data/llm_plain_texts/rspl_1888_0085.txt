tldr: The author investigates the relationship between a mother and her foetus when the foetus contracts an infectious disease. They found that a mother can be protected from the disease, even if she is exposed to the same virus as her foetus. This protection occurs when the foetus is inoculated with the anthrax virus, and the mother remains healthy even after giving birth to the infected foetus. The author also discovered that the placenta plays a role in this protection, as the anthrax bacteria are found only in the foetal portion of the placenta.
