tldr: The authors studied the reactions of hydroxyl radicals with methane and oxygen, using hydrogen peroxide decomposition as a source. They confirmed the relative rates of reaction with methane, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen peroxide under different experimental conditions. The results showed that the reaction of methyl radicals with oxygen is second-order at 525Â°C. The authors also investigated the effect of adding methane and carbon monoxide to decomposing hydrogen peroxide, finding that hydrogen production was influenced by the pressure and the presence of oxygen.
