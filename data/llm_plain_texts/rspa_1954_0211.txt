tldr: The authors developed a new apparatus to measure the melting curves of argon and nitrogen at low temperatures and high pressures up to 10,000 atm. They used a combined cryostat and high-pressure intensifier connected by a single junction at room temperature. The pressure was produced in a series of stages, with the final stage being a single intensification stroke on a small volume of gas maintained at low temperatures in a long steel tube. Solidification and melting were detected using a small steel pellet moved by an external magnetic field. The solid-fluid equilibrium line was extended to 8,250 atm for argon and 9,100 atm for nitrogen.
