tldr: The authors analyze a mass action kinetic scheme derived from the Lotka-Volterra model to study the dynamics of three competitive species. They demonstrate that the system exhibits both nearly conservative and strongly dissipative solutions, depending on the selection of initial conditions. The model shows a fractal torus that supports chaotic solutions and a nested tori family in three-dimensional space, with implications for various scientific areas, such as medicine, neurobiology, chemistry, and fluid dynamics.
