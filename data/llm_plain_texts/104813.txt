tldr: The author, Benj. Robins, discovered that the electricity in glass can disturb mariners' compasses and delicate balances. Wiping the glass with a finger can cause the compass needle to move, and moistening the glass surface can prevent this disturbance. The author suggests that glass may become attractive without friction and could be excited by air concussions, such as thunder or the discharge of great ordnance. This discovery may explain the minute, irregular, and reciprocating variations observed in the directions of dipping and horizontal needles and the disturbances in the balance's scales.
