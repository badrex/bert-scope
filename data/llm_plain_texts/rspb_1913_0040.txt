tldr: This study examines the infectivity of tsetse flies (Glossina morsitans) in Nyasaland and identifies the species of disease-producing trypanosomes they carry. The research found that 13.5 out of every 1,000 tsetse flies were infective with pathogenic trypanosomes, with T. brucei vel rhodesiense being the main cause of the Human Trypanosome Disease of Nyasaland. The study suggests that eradicating wild game in the area could help prevent the spread of the disease.
