tldr: The authors investigate the tropomyosin-paramyosin system in relation to the unique properties of lamellibranch "catch" muscles. They find that the high rigidity of these muscles in tonic contraction is due to the tropomyosin-paramyosin system, suggesting that free ATP acts as a physiological plasticizer, affecting the electrostatic interactions between tropomyosin molecules within or between paramyosin filaments.
