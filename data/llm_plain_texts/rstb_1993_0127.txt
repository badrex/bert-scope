tldr: The author discusses the genetic and molecular mechanisms controlling the cell cycle in eukaryotic cells, focusing on the fission yeast as a model organism. The study of cell cycle genes and their regulation has provided insights into the controls of cell reproduction, with implications for understanding diseases like cancer. The author highlights the key role of the p34cdc2 protein kinase in regulating the onset of M-phase and coupling it to the completion of S-phase.
