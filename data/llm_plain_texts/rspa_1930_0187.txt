tldr: This article investigates the connection between thunderstorms and penetrating radiation. The author suggests that powerful electric fields within thunderstorms can accelerate particles, called runaway electrons, which may gain a significant amount of energy. These electrons can potentially produce penetrating radiation. The author also finds that thunderstorms can sometimes stop a large fraction of the ordinary penetrating radiation passing through them. The study uses an ionization chamber with an electroscope to measure ionization and detect the presence of these electrons.
