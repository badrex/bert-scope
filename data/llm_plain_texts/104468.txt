tldr: In this letter, Dr. Henry Miles describes his experiment of igniting phosphorus using electricity. He applied a small piece of phosphorus to an excited glass tube, which immediately caught fire, emitting a considerable amount of flame and smoke. He also observed larger and more substantial corruscations of light during the experiment. This discovery could potentially lead to further research on the interaction between electricity and chemical reactions.
