tldr: The author presents a method to obtain equations of motion for two oscillating particles under the influence of their mutual gravitation and an external force, such as a spring. They use the Einstein, Infeld, and Hoffmann approximation method and introduce a stress singularity to represent the force in the spring. The calculations are taken to the Newtonian order, providing equations of motion for the oscillating particles.
