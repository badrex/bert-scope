tldr: The authors study the transverse dynamical correlations in an Ising model and demonstrate that the relaxation processes behave differently depending on the lattice dimensionality. They find that the transverse dynamics of the Ising model is characterized by two frequencies, a zero-frequency mode and a unit-frequency mode, which are unaffected by the sign of the exchange interaction between the Ising spins. The results illustrate the limitations of mean-field descriptions of dynamics in quantum many-body systems.
