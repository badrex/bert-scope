tldr: The authors conducted a spectroscopic study of trebly-ionized lead (Pb IV) using various spectrographs and a range of wavelengths. They identified and measured the wavelengths of numerous spectral lines and established the terms and configurations of the lead ions. The study utilized Moseley curves to confirm and refine the analysis of the spectrum, leading to a better understanding of the atomic structure and properties of Pb IV.
