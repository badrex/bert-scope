tldr: The author investigates the physiology and morphology of iron- and manganese-depositing flagellates, specifically Anthophysa vegetans, Siderodendron manganiferum, and Siphomonas, through cultural experiments. These organisms thrive in quiet, well-aerated waters with low organic substance content and deposit iron and manganese compounds. They live in association with iron bacteria, such as the Leptothrix group, and their growth improves when these bacteria are removed. The author provides a detailed description of the flagellates' appearance and behavior under various conditions.
