tldr: This study examines the metabolism of phenylacetic acid in humans and various species, including sub-human primates and non-primate animals. Four amino acid conjugates of phenylacetic acid were found in different species, but their occurrence varies. In humans, only the glutamine conjugate was excreted, while in other species, the glycine conjugate was more common. The findings suggest that the conjugation of phenylacetic acid with amino acids may be related to the evolutionary status of the species.
