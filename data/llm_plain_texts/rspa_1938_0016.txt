tldr: The article investigates the production of neutrons when beryllium is bombarded with alpha particles. The authors find that the energy distribution of the emitted neutrons can be explained by considering the nuclear reactions and excited states of the beryllium nucleus. The study provides insights into the processes involved in neutron production and the behavior of beryllium under bombardment.
