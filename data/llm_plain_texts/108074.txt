tldr: The author discusses the equilibrium of a mass of homogeneous fluid and the role of the center of mass in maintaining that equilibrium. They explain how the forces acting on the fluid must balance out for equilibrium to be achieved and introduce the concept of the center of mass as the point where all forces vanish. The author also explores the effects of external pressures on the fluid's equilibrium.
