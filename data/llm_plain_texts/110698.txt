tldr: The author investigates the chemical composition of archil and litmus, focusing on the decoloration and reddening processes. They find that the reddening of litmus is not proof that chloride of hydrogen is an acid, and that the double decomposition that occurs is the same in principle, whether hydrogen or a fixed metal is involved. The author also examines the action of chlorine on orceine and azolitmine, and notes that the products of the bleaching energy of chlorine resemble compounds of chlorine that have bleaching powers.
