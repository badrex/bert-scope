tldr: This article discusses the microstructural development of cement hydration products, focusing on the structure of colloidal C-S-H gel, the kinetics of hydration, and the aqueous solution chemistry of cement pastes. The author examines theories related to the mechanism of cement hydration and the effects of accelerating and retarding admixtures. The development of strength in cement paste is associated with the precipitation of low-solubility hydration products, forming a cohesive matrix that binds cement grains into a composite solid.
