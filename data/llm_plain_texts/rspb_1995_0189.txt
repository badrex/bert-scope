tldr: 'The author investigates the biodiverse patterns and genetic differences in "Evolution Canyon," Israel, where the Asian, African, and European biotas meet. The study reveals that the south-facing slope, with higher solar radiation, harbors African and Asian xeric tropical biota, while the north-facing slope, with a temperate European climate, is richer in aquatic-dependent taxa. The research suggests that microclimatic aridity diversifying selection is a major evolutionary force driving adaptive molecular and organismal evolution.'
