tldr: The author examines the development of the spinal cord in humans, mammals, and birds, focusing on the formation of nerve fibers and the role of intervertebral ganglia. They describe the process of development, including the growth of nerve cells and the changes in the structure and appearance of the ganglia as the fetus matures. This research provides valuable insights into the development of the nervous system in various species.
