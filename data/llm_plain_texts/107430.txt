tldr: The author, David Brewster, investigates the unique optical properties of agate, a crystallized stone, and its ability to polarize and refract light. He discovers that the structure of agate produces two distinct images, a bright image and a nebulous one, and that the stone's structure is connected to its optical properties. Brewster also explores the different structures within agate and their effects on light transmission and reflection.
