tldr: This article discusses the detectability of young galaxies and their evolution in the early universe. It explores the challenges in detecting young galaxies and the factors that affect their detectability, such as redshift, dust absorption, and the presence of a young stellar population. The author also examines the properties of young galaxies, their morphological characteristics, and the potential for finding them in nearby clusters.
