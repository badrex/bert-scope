tldr: The authors studied the magnetochemistry and stoichiometry of the copper-oxygen system by monitoring the magnetic susceptibility of finely divided copper specimens as they were slowly oxidized in situ on a magnetic balance at low pressure and low temperature. They found that beyond the stoichiometric point, an extensive metastable non-stoichiometry may be sustained at these temperatures. Further oxidation or treatment in vacuo at high temperatures causes the oxygen excess to be nucleated, and antiferromagnetic cupric oxide is formed. The results have implications for the mechanism of the oxidation of copper.
