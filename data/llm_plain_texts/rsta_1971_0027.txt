tldr: The authors summarize a conference on the petrology of igneous and metamorphic rocks from the ocean floor. They discuss the extensive variation of ocean-floor basalts and their metamorphism, and emphasize the need for more research, including extended traverses across the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and drilling programs through the ocean floor. They also propose the establishment of a coordinating committee to review progress and encourage future studies.
