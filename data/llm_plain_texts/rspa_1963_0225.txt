tldr: The authors conducted an electron microscopical investigation of stacking faults and dislocations in titanium dioxide thin films grown on titanium carbide crystals. They found that large stacking faults formed during the growth process lie on a {101} plane and can change to another plane within the same family. The fault can be terminated by a partial dislocation, and when the specimen is heated, the fault can anneal out by two mechanisms: glide of the partial dislocation or growth of small dislocation loops from vacancies introduced due to deviations from stoichiometric composition. The observed dislocations are of two types: dissociated dislocations with a partial vector and undissociated dislocations with a Burgers vector. Interactions between dislocations and vacancy clusters are also observed, which may contribute to the increased yield stress when the material becomes substoichiometric.
