tldr: This article discusses a fossil humerus from Wellington Valley, which closely resembles the existing monotrematous genus Echidna. The author also corrects a previous paper's calculation of Verdet's constant, resolving a discrepancy with M. H. L883 Becquerel's comparative experiments. Lastly, the article examines the magnetic survey of Scotland and the local attraction affecting the determination of the dip.
