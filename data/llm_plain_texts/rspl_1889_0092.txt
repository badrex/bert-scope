revised_title: 'Investigating the Tension of Recently Formed Liquid Surfaces'
semantic_tags:
  - Surface Tension
  - Capillary Phenomena
  - Liquid Coating
  - Marangoni Effect
  - Soap Solutions
tldr: 'The author investigates the tension of recently formed liquid surfaces, focusing on soap solutions and the role of a coating on the liquid surface. They use a water jet experiment to measure the capillary tension and find that the tension of soap solutions is lower than that of pure water, suggesting that the presence of a coating on the liquid surface plays a role in this phenomenon.'
