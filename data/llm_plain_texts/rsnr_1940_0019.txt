tldr: This article discusses the invention of the ophthalmoscope by Charles Babbage in 1847, four years before H. von Helmholtz published his version of the instrument. Babbage's invention was not recognized at the time, and it was von Helmholtz who is credited with the development of the more efficient ophthalmoscope. The article also highlights the early history of ophthalmology and the contributions of William Cumming and Wharton Jones in the field.
