revised_title: 'Diffusion of Gases through Rubber Membranes'
semantic_tags:
  - Gas diffusion
  - Rubber properties
  - Permeability
  - Fick's law
  - Gas absorption
tldr: 'The authors investigate the process of gas diffusion through rubber membranes, focusing on hydrogen and its interaction with other gases. They find that the permeability of a rubber film is inversely proportional to its thickness and that gases pass through the membrane independently of one another. The study provides a foundation for understanding gas diffusion in various applications, such as balloon and airship fabrics.'
