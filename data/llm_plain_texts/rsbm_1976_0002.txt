tldr: 'This article is a biographical memoir of James Chadwick, a renowned physicist who made significant contributions to the field of nuclear physics. Chadwick was born in 1891 and studied at Manchester University, where he was influenced by Ernest Rutherford. He worked with various scientists, including A. S. Russell and Geiger, and made important discoveries in the field of radioactivity. Chadwick's decision to work in Berlin with Geiger proved to be a turning point in his career, as he learned more about physics and met many notable scientists. His work was interrupted by World War I, during which he was interned as an enemy alien. After the war, Chadwick continued his research and made groundbreaking discoveries in nuclear physics, including the discovery of the neutron.'
