tldr: The article describes the unique multiple bank rod fovea of Bajacalifornia drakei, a deep-sea teleost fish. The fish has large eyes with sighting grooves and rostral aphakic gaps, which allow for binocular vision. The fovea is located in the temporal periphery of the retina and is composed of many banks of rods. The study provides insights into the possible mechanism of formation of the new banks and the optical function of the fovea in deep-sea fish vision.
