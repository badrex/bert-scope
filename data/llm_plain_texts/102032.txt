tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the increase in weight of oil of vitriol when exposed to the air. They found that the increase in weight is due to the moisture in the air, which the oil absorbs. The author also observed that the increase in weight is more significant in moist, rainy, and snowy weather and less in dry, clear weather. The substance gained from the air is mostly water, and the increase in weight cannot be determined by a general rule as it varies depending on the strength of the oil of vitriol and other circumstances.
