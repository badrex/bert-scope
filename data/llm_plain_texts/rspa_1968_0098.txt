tldr: The authors investigate the role of exchange effects in the rotational excitation of molecular hydrogen by slow electrons. They use a scattering formalism and a single-center molecular wavefunction to calculate the rotational excitation cross-section. The inclusion of exchange results in a significant increase in the cross-section, highlighting the importance of considering exchange effects in the theoretical discussion of electron energy loss by rotational excitation in slow collisions.
