tldr: The author, John Davidson, collected water from the sacred well Zem-Zem and sent it to Professor Faraday for analysis. Unfortunately, the can was opened during transit, releasing the gas that held the minerals in solution. Despite this, Faraday was able to analyze the precipitate and found it to be rich in carbonate of protoxide of iron. The clear fluid contained muriate, sulphate, lime, potash, soda, and an alkaline nitrate, which Faraday believed to be saltpetre added by the priests.
