tldr: The author, James Farquharson, observed the Aurora Borealis and discovered a definite arrangement and order in its appearance and progress. He found that the luminous belt of the Aurora Borealis is at a constant height above the Earth's surface and is related to the Earth's magnetic meridian. Farquharson's observations led to a better understanding of the phenomenon and its connection to Earth's geomagnetism.
