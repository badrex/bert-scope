tldr: This study examines three Ethiopian populations living at different altitudes to understand the effects of altitude on their physique, respiratory function, and blood markers. The research found that highland populations had larger forced expiratory volumes and forced vital capacities compared to lowlanders. However, there was some evidence of lower hemoglobin concentrations in highlanders. The study suggests that the populations are genetically similar, and the findings are discussed in terms of physiological and developmental adaptability.
