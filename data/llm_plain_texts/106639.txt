tldr: 'In 1786, William Herschel published a catalogue containing one thousand new Nebulae and Clusters of stars. He used a 20-feet focal length telescope to observe and document these celestial objects. The observations were made through a series of oscillations, which he called "sweeps." He later improved his method by using a vertical motion and an assistant to record his observations. This allowed him to discover and document a significant number of new celestial objects for the scientific community.'
