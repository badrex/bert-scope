tldr: The authors investigate the relationships between linear transformations, sequences, and complex numbers. They focus on a specific class of matrices and explore the possible sets that can be generated by sequences with these matrices. The problem is equivalent to one in the calculus of variations and can be solved using elementary methods. The main results include the sum of all possible sets and the norm of the matrix, which play a crucial role in understanding the problem.
