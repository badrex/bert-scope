tldr: The author conducted experiments to investigate the ionization of atmospheric air and the leakage of electricity through dust-free air. They discovered that there is a continual leakage of electricity from a charged conductor suspended in a closed vessel containing dust-free air. The leakage rate is independent of the potential and is approximately proportional to the pressure. The loss of charge per second is such as would result from the production of about 20 ions of either sign in each cubic centimeter per second in air at atmospheric pressure.
