tldr: The article describes the fine morphology of the osphradial sense organs in six placophorans and eight bivalves, representing all major subgroups of Placophora and Bivalvia. The osphradial sense organs are chemoreceptors, primarily used in sexual biology, such as coordinating spawning and searching for a mate. The study provides insights into the homology of osphradia throughout the Mollusca and their function.
