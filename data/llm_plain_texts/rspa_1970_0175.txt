tldr: The authors used coherent inelastic neutron scattering to measure the dispersion curves of intermolecular modes in deuterated hexamethylenetetramine crystal at 100 and 298 K. They analyzed the results using phenomenological models involving interactions between rigid molecules and found that both first and second nearest-neighbor interactions are necessary for an adequate description. The study provides insights into the intermolecular dynamics and force constants of hexamethylenetetramine.
