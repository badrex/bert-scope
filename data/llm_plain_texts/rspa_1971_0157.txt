tldr: This study investigates the growth of fatigue cracks in low-density polyethylene using non-classical fracture mechanics. The authors found that most materials reveal two distinct regions with different fracture mechanics parameters, linked by a transition zone. The fatigue life of virgin specimens can be predicted using the crack growth characteristics and the size of intrinsic flaws, which correspond to the polyethylene spherulites.
