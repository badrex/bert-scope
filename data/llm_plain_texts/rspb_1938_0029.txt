tldr: 'This study investigates the impact of maternal size on the growth and conformation of offspring in Shire horse-Shetland pony crosses. The researchers found that the size of the mother influences the size of the foetus, with smaller mothers producing smaller offspring and larger mothers producing larger offspring. The study also found that these differences in size at birth affect the subsequent growth and permanent proportions of the body. This research has implications for understanding the role of maternal effects in animal breeding and the inheritance of traits in offspring.'
