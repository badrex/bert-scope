tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the coefficients of expansion of di-iodide of lead (PbI2) and an alloy of iodide of lead with iodide of silver (PbI2.AgI). They discovered that the iodide of lead has three coefficients of expansion, with a rapid expansion occurring between 253°C and 265°C. The author also found that the specific gravity of iodide of lead is less than the mean specific gravity of its constituents.
