tldr: 'In 1797, John Frere discovered flint implements in Hoxne, Suffolk, which he believed were made by prehistoric humans. He recognized that the position of the implements indicated significant geological changes had occurred since their creation. Frere's discovery challenged the prevailing views of man's antiquity and paved the way for further research into the Palaeolithic era.'
