tldr: Charles Bell's paper investigates the distinct functions of the six nerves of the brain that go to the eye. He demonstrates that each nerve has a specific role, such as the Ophthalmicus nerve, which bestows sensibility to pain and controls eyelid movements. Bell also emphasizes the importance of anatomical investigation over experiments on living animals in understanding the nervous system.
