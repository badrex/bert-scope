tldr: The author examines the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of energy in a system of atoms and doublets, testing the proposition that the time-averaged kinetic energy of each atom, shell, and globule will be equal. The author presents a series of test cases to validate this proposition and discusses the implications for the kinetic theory of gases.
