tldr: The authors extended the calculations of magnetostriction in ferromagnetic crystals below saturation by Akulov and Heisenberg to cover the case of an iron-like single crystal in the form of an oblate spheroid. They compared their magnetostriction curves with experimental measurements and found good agreement. The study provides a more accurate comparison with experiment by calculating the variation of magnetostriction with applied field for directions other than the principal crystallographic axes.
