tldr: This article explores the use of confocal optical microscopy for semiconductor metrology, focusing on the accuracy of edge detection and line-width measurement. The authors discuss the behavior of imaging systems near diffracting boundaries and present experimental results that suggest a simple theoretical model can be used to improve the accuracy of measurements.
