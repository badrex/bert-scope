tldr: The authors studied the polymerization of p-methoxystyrene and determined the velocity constants involved in the process. They found that the polymerization kinetics and molecular weight of the resulting polymer conform to the Houwink viscosity law, with an exponent similar to that for polystyrene. The intrinsic viscosity of the polymer depends mainly on the length of the chains in solutions where the solvent molecules resemble the polymer segments.
