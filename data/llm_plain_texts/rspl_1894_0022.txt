tldr: The article investigates the germination process of pollen grains and the nutrition of pollen tubes. It explores the presence of enzymes in pollen grains and their role in the growth and nutrition of the pollen tube. The research also examines the reserve materials in pollen grains and styles, and how they contribute to the germination process. The findings suggest that enzymes play a crucial role in the germination and nutrition of pollen grains and tubes, and that the absorption of food material stimulates the production of these enzymes.
