tldr: This study investigates the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in Aplysia sensorimotor synapses. The researchers found that LTP can be induced by pairing sensory neuron activity with depolarization of the motor neuron, and this process is partially dependent on the activation of an NMDA-related receptor. The results suggest a role for this type of synaptic plasticity in classical conditioning of the defensive withdrawal reflex of Aplysia.
