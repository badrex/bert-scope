  - Magnetic dipole interaction
tldr: The authors measured the magnetic susceptibility and specific heat of dysprosium ethyl sulfate at various temperatures. They found that the properties of the substance can be explained by magnetic dipole interactions between the ions, making it a useful model for studying these interactions. The ground state of the magnetic ions and the energy of excited states were also determined.
