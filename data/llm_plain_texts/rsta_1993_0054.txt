tldr: The article presents a comprehensive study of the seasonal cycles and spatial variability in the North Sea system. A comprehensive, interdisciplinary data set was obtained by repeating the same cruise track in the southern North Sea at monthly intervals from August 1988 to October 1989. The study focused on processes such as temperature, salinity, suspended sediments, chlorophyll, nutrients, dissolved oxygen, and air-sea fluxes. The results provide valuable data for initializing and testing models of the North Sea's seasonal cycles and deviations from them, as well as for studying the processes involved.
