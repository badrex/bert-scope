tldr: This study investigates the motion of round wires through ice, focusing on pressure melting and regelation. The authors conducted experiments under controlled conditions and found that the long-accepted picture of the phenomenon is correct, but discrepancies can be resolved by incorporating three additional effects. The results provide a better understanding of ice mechanics and the behavior of objects moving through it.
