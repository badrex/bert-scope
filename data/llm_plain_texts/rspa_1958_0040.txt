revised_title: 'Spectroscopic Detection and Analysis of Transient Intermediates in Quinones and Dyes'
semantic_tags:
  - Photochemistry
  - Quinones
  - Dyes
  - Semiquinone radicals
  - Triplet states
tldr: The authors used flash photolysis to study the primary photoprocesses in quinones and dyes, detecting and analyzing transient intermediates such as semiquinone radicals and triplet states. Their findings provide a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in photosensitization and dye fading.
