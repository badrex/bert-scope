tldr: The study investigates whether area V5 of the human visual cortex is activated by motion stimuli generated from hue differences alone. Using positron emission tomography, the researchers found that when subjects perceived motion, a change in regional cerebral blood flow occurred in areas V5, V1/2, V3, and the parieto-occipital sulcus, but not V4. This suggests that motion-specialized areas of the visual cortex can use information derived from any source to perform their function.
