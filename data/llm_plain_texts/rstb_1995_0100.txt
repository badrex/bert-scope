tldr: The authors investigate visual pattern memory in Drosophila melanogaster using a new learning paradigm called novelty choice. They found that flies can recognize and remember visual patterns, and their preference for new patterns over familiar ones can be explained by a graded similarity function. This function is independent of the geometrical properties of the employed figures and suggests that visual pattern memory at this basic level does not require shape analysis.
