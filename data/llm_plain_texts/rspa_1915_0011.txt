tldr: In this article, A. Fowler investigates a previously unknown band spectrum associated with helium. They discover a new type of series in the band spectrum, which resembles the arrangement of line spectra. The study includes nine main series bands and four fainter second series bands, with doublet separations that do not follow the typical pattern of line spectra. The findings suggest a comparison with the Principal and Diffuse series in line spectra, but no equivalent of the Sharp series has been identified yet.
