tldr: 'This article examines the evolution of human bipedalism by analyzing the locomotion of Australopithecus, an early hominoid. The author discusses the challenges in understanding the biomechanics of fossil remains and the importance of studying the innominate bone to determine the use of the hindlimb in Australopithecus. The article concludes that the unique morphology of the innominate bone suggests that Australopithecus had a different form of bipedalism compared to Homo sapiens and may have used its hindlimb in both arboreal and terrestrial locomotion.'
