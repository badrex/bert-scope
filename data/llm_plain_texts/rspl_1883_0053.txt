tldr: 'The author, W. N. Hartley, observed and analyzed the line spectra of boron and silicon through the use of a spark and photographic camera. They discovered three strong, sharp lines characteristic of boron and a strong spectrum group with seven lines attributed to silicon. This research marked the first spectra of boron and silicon obtained from metallic salts.'
