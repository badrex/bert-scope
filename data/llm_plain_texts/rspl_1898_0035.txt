tldr: The author investigates the structure of cubic crystals with cubic cleavage, focusing on the atomic volumes and packing of atoms within them. They propose that the arrangement of atoms in these crystals is due to a balance of forces and that the closest packing of spheres is a key factor in their rigidity. The study provides insights into the properties of crystals and the behavior of atoms within them.
