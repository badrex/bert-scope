tldr: The author, A. W. Hofmann, investigates the properties of thialdine, an important alkaloid containing sulfur. Through a series of experiments, Hofmann determines that thialdine is a tertiary base and explores its reactions with iodide of methyl and oxide of silver. He also debunks the idea that thialdine can be converted into leucine, a common misconception at the time.
