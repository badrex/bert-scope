tldr: This article investigates the geophysical parameters and lithospheric dynamics of mid-plate volcanism in Africa. It examines the relationship between plate thickness, velocity, and the spatial and temporal distribution of volcanic activity. The study finds that most of Africa's mid-plate volcanism can be explained by variations in plate thickness and velocity, with cratonic and non-cratonic regions showing distinct differences in heat flow, seismic velocities, and lithospheric thickness.
