tldr: This article investigates the existence and properties of steady finite-amplitude waves, called cats-eye waves, in unidirectional inviscid and incompressible shear flows. The authors develop a numerical approach to solve the problem and find that the phase speed of the waves is linearly related to the wave amplitude. The study provides insights into the behavior of nonlinear waves in fluid dynamics and has implications for understanding the formation and properties of critical layers in shear flows.
