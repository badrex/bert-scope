tldr: The authors, G. D. Liveing and J. Dewar, conducted experiments to study the spectra of sodium and potassium using an electric arc. They discovered multiple lines and groups in both elements' spectra, providing detailed descriptions and wave-lengths for each. Their findings suggest that the spectra have a harmonic progression, with each group consisting of four lines becoming fainter and more diffuse as they are more refrangible.
