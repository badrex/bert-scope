tldr: The authors studied the haemoglobin content in the blood of Daphnia, discovering that it increases when oxygen levels in the water are low. They found that nutrition plays a role in haemoglobin synthesis, with the content increasing with the amount of algal food consumed up to a certain level. The study also revealed that chlorophyll in the food does not favor haemoglobin synthesis, and that the haemoglobin content varies within each stage of the Daphnia's life cycle.
