tldr: The authors conducted interferometric measurements in the arc spectrum of iron to improve the accuracy of wave-length measurements. They compared their findings with previous measurements and found a systematic difference, which they attributed to experimental error. The results contribute to the development of more accurate iron secondary standards for astronomical research.
