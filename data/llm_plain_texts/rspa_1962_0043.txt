tldr: This article presents a general theory for small thermoelastic deformations in a body that has been subjected to initial stress and was initially anisotropic. The author examines two special cases, one concerning small thermoelastic deformations in a body under initial stress, and the other considering the torsion of an initially stretched rhombic crystal and wave propagation in homogeneously stressed bodies. The study aims to clarify the stress-strain relations and energy function for small elastic deformations of initially stressed bodies.
