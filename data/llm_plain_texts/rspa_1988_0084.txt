tldr: The authors present a double pendulum model as an analogue to interacting gravity waves. They demonstrate that the energy and action of the smaller pendulum remain relatively constant, providing insights into the behavior of short surface waves riding on longer gravity waves, which is relevant to the formation of whitecaps on the sea surface and ocean imaging by radar backscatter.
