tldr: The author investigates surfusion, a phenomenon where metals and alloys can be maintained in a fluid state at temperatures below their freezing points. They use a recording pyrometer and a thermo-junction to study the behavior of various metals and alloys, discovering that surfusion is not only present in pure metals but also in alloys. The author also explains the complex records of molecular changes that occur during surfusion, which can reveal information about the behavior of alloys and freezing solutions of salts.
