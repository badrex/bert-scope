  - Carbon dioxide regulation
  - Metabolite analysis
tldr: This article explores the analysis of photosynthesis control in C4 plants by studying changes in light and carbon dioxide. The authors discuss the use of metabolite analysis and various fractionation procedures to understand the regulation of photosynthesis and its interaction with the Calvin cycle. They also examine the role of electron transport and the assimilatory force in the process.
