tldr: This article discusses the study of extragalactic objects in the gamma-ray region of the spectrum. It focuses on the detection of gamma-ray emission from quasars, Seyfert galaxies, and radio galaxies. The authors explore the implications of these observations in relation to the physical conditions in the nuclei of active galaxies. They also discuss the mechanisms for the production of gamma-rays in these active galactic nuclei.
