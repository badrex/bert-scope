tldr: The article discusses the challenges and strategies for controlling the spread of the vector Simulium damnosum, responsible for onchocerciasis, a disease that hinders development in African savannah regions. The authors outline a multidisciplinary approach, including entomological, hydrobiological, and medical evaluations, to effectively treat and reduce the impact of the disease on human communities. The use of larvicides and targeted treatments are key components in this strategy.
