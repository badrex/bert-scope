tldr: The article discusses the interaction of electromagnetic and hydrodynamic forces in a conducting liquid in turbulent motion. It explores the spontaneous magnetic field generated by the fluid's turbulence and its effects on the magnetic field lines. The study assumes the fluid is incompressible, homogeneous, and without imposed electric or magnetic fields. The research provides insights into the energy transfer between different parts of the dynamic system and the behavior of magnetic fields in turbulent fluids.
