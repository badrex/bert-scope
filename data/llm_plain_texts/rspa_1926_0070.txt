tldr: This article investigates the changes in glass surfaces when rubbed with flexible materials like cotton, linen, and silk. The authors study the electric charges displayed by the glass surfaces and the coefficient of friction between them after rubbing. They explore the effects of triboelectricity and friction on various materials and discuss the role of contamination and physical changes in the surfaces. The findings contribute to the understanding of material science and the behavior of triboelectric and frictional effects in different materials.
