tldr: This article investigates the magnetic susceptibility of various binary alloys, including gold-lead, lead-silver, tin-aluminum, and tin-cadmium alloys. The researchers used a Curie and Cheneveau magneto balance to measure the susceptibility and found that the alloys' magnetic properties varied depending on their composition. The study provides insights into the magnetic behavior of these alloys and their potential applications in various fields.
