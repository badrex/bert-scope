tldr: The JET project describes the design, manufacture, and assembly of a large tokamak machine for controlled nuclear fusion. The machine uses deuterium-tritium mixtures to achieve significant heating of the plasma and is the first of its kind to operate with tritium. The design focuses on cost-effectiveness, compactness, and modularity, with a modular concept used in the vacuum vessel, structure, and poloidal-field coils. The machine's assembly took one year, and it has since been run to its maximum design level of performance.
