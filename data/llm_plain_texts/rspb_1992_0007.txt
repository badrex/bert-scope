tldr: Researchers identified monohydroxy fatty acid eicosanoids in barnacles and found that 8-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid (8-HEPE) was the only one with egg hatching activity in barnacles. The study also showed that the 8 conformation is necessary for activity, as 8(6')-HEPE caused egg hatching, while the enantiomer 8(kS')-HEPE was inactive.
