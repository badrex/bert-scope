tldr: In this article, the author describes experiments conducted by the Royal Society to measure the absolute velocity of electricity. They used a method involving wires and an electrical machine to determine the velocity of electricity through a specific distance. The experiments showed that the velocity of electricity was instantaneous over the entire length of the wire, which was over two miles long. This research helped to further understand the properties and behavior of electricity.
