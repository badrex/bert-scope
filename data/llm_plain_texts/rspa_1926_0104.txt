tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the infra-red secondary spectrum of hydrogen, observing 320 lines of greater than Ha wave-length. They found that the character of the secondary spectrum depends on the conditions of excitation and pressure of the gas. The authors also extended Fulcher's first band into the infra-red and analyzed the wave-numbers of the members of the Sx, S2, and S3 bands. Their findings contribute to the understanding of the quantum theory of band spectra.
