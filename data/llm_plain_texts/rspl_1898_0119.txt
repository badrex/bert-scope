tldr: This article investigates the perturbations of the Leonids, a meteor shower, and their impact on the meteor stream's orbit. The authors, G. Johnstone Stoney and A. M. W. Downing, analyze the effects of Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus on the meteor stream's orbit and discuss the implications for predicting meteor showers. They also differentiate between ortho-Leonids and clino-Leonids, explaining the differences in their orbits and the resulting meteor showers.
