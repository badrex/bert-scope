tldr: This article presents combined photographic and radio observations of meteors to determine the attachment coefficient of electrons to oxygen molecules. The authors analyze meteor trails and their radio echoes to understand the processes that remove electrons at different heights above the Earth's surface. They conclude that attachment processes are the predominant factor in the removal of electrons.
