tldr: This article reviews the United Kingdom's research on the biological control of aphids, focusing on the peach-potato aphid (Myzus persicae), which is a major worldwide pest. The study covers genetic variation, host plant relations, population dynamics, and dispersal by flight. The authors discuss future strategies for aphid control based on this research, emphasizing the need for a more sophisticated approach to chemical control and the importance of understanding aphid biology and ecology.
