tldr: This article discusses the advantages and disadvantages of intrauterine devices (IUDs) and hormone implants as contraceptives. IUDs have a high efficacy rate and do not require patient motivation for continued use, but may cause increased menstrual blood loss and are associated with a risk of pelvic inflammatory disease. Hormone implants offer long-term ovulation inhibition but are still in the testing stage and have limited clinical experience. The choice between these contraceptives depends on individual needs and preferences.
