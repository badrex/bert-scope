tldr: This article investigates the thermodynamic properties and melting of solid helium at various temperatures and pressures. The authors discovered that solid helium can be compressed to less than half its volume under equilibrium conditions at absolute zero and found that the melting curve shows no signs of a solid-fluid critical point. The experiments provide valuable data on the solid state over a wide range of volumes, helping to elucidate questions in the theory of the solid state.
