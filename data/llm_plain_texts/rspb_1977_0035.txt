tldr: The author investigates the incompatibility systems in plants, specifically focusing on a sporophytic system with two and three genes in Eruca sativa. They analyze the percentage of reciprocal and non-reciprocal incompatible matings between different genotypes in a diallel matrix and find that a three-gene sporophytic system best fits the data. This study helps to understand the genetic and biochemical control of incompatibility in plants.
