tldr: The authors conducted a study on bumblebees and their trypanosome parasites to understand the role of parasites in maintaining genetic variability within social insect colonies. They found that parasites can enhance parasite transmission among individuals, leading to negative frequency-dependent selection against common host genotypes. This suggests that parasites can have significant implications for the genetic structure of social groups and may play a role in the evolution of social behavior.
