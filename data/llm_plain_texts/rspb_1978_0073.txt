tldr: The authors propose a new model called 'hyperchirality' to explain the kinetics of morphogenesis and pattern formation in single cells. They compare this model to the Mills model for spontaneous resolution and the Turing model for morphogenesis. The hyperchirality model suggests that a pair of enantiomers can be used as a morphogen, with the optical asymmetry being the out-of-equilibrium morphogen concentration variable. This model allows for scaling factors and can explain the constancy or variability in the number of pattern units in a system.
