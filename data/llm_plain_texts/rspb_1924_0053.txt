revised_title: 'Selective Photochemical Action of Polarised Light on Starch Hydrolysis'
semantic_tags:
  - Photochemistry
  - Polarized light
  - Starch hydrolysis
  - Enzyme action
  - Plant growth
tldr: 'This study investigates the effect of polarized light on the hydrolysis of starch. The authors found that plane-polarized light accelerates the hydrolysis of starch by diastase, suggesting a selective photochemical effect. The results could have implications for understanding plant growth and the role of light in enzymatic reactions.'
