tldr: The authors present a general analysis of elastic surface waves polarized in a plane of material symmetry. They establish an existence-uniqueness theorem for these waves and develop a method to determine the displacement field and traction on planes parallel to the boundary. The study focuses on homogeneous, anisotropic elastic materials and provides a foundation for further research on surface waves in more complex materials.
