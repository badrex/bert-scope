tldr: 'Seismic tomography allows us to map the Earth's three-dimensional seismic wave velocity variations, which are related to temperature and lateral heterogeneity. This helps us understand mantle convection, plate tectonics, and other geological processes. The study of seismic anomalies provides constraints on the modeling of mantle convection and the viscosity distribution in the Earth's mantle, as well as insights into petrology, geochemistry, geomagnetism, gravity, and mineral physics.'
