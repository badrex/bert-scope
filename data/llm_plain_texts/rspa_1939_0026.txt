tldr: The authors conducted experiments using a magnetic spectrometer to study the X-ray spectrum of Ra E and investigate the effects of experimental conditions on the distribution curve. They found that factors such as absorption, back-scattering, and scattering from the spectrometer walls can affect the distribution curve. The authors also observed two well-defined lines at 710 and 1.37 MeV, and evidence of a less intense but incompletely resolved line at 0.88 MeV, which are produced by internal conversion in the Ra E decay process.
