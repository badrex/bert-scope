tldr: 'This article investigates the mechanics of large bubbles rising through liquids and within tubes. The authors find that the shape of the upper surface of the bubble is always spherical, and they provide a theoretical discussion based on the assumption that the pressure over the front of the bubble is the same as that in ideal hydrodynamic flow around a sphere. The authors also analyze the case of a large bubble rising up a circular tube filled with water and emptying at the bottom, which is capable of being analyzed completely because the bubble is not followed by a wake.'
