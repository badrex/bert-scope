tldr: This article discusses the environmental evolution and transition from marine to freshwater conditions in the late Silurian and early Devonian in the Anglo-Welsh region. The study focuses on the rapid replacement of one deposition environment by another and the changes in source lands that provided sedimentary materials. The transition from marine to freshwater conditions took place over a period of around 8 million years, with at least two periods of rapid and pronounced change. The article highlights the main elements that contributed to the structural foundations of the area that experienced the marine to freshwater transition, such as the Irish Sea Ridge, the Welsh Basin, St David's Land, the Midland Microcraton, and the East Anglian Foldbelt.
