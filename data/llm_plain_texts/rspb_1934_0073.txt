tldr: The authors study the structure and origin of corpora lutea in various lower vertebrates, examining their development from ruptured ovarian follicles. They also investigate the effects of injections of anterior pituitary extracts on ovulation and subsequent changes in the ruptured follicles. The research provides insights into the role of hormones in the reproductive process and the differences between oviparous and viviparous forms among lower vertebrates.
