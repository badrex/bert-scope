tldr: This article investigates the influence of surface charge on the electrostatic energy of an ionic crystal. The author extends previous work on the shape-dependent effects on the energy and considers the impact of distributing excess charge on the crystal's surface. The study finds that the minimum energy occurs when the surface charge density is well-defined and is the standard shape-independent Madelung crystal energy.
