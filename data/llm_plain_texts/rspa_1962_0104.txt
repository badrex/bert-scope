tldr: The authors study the kinematic branch points of n-particle reaction amplitudes, discovering a new class of kinematic branch points that exist only for graphs with six lines or more. They introduce generalized momentum variables, called -variables, to find the position of these branch points in the many-dimensional complex space through simple algebraic computations.
