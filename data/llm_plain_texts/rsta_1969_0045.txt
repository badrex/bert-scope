tldr: This article discusses the influence of wind turning with height on crosswind diffusion in air pollution. The authors examine theoretical aspects and present two independent series of diffusion experiments to understand the time of travel or distance downwind beyond which wind shear contributes significantly to crosswind dispersion. The results indicate that the effect of wind shear becomes dominant over crosswind turbulence at a certain distance downwind.
