tldr: The authors conducted experiments on various muscle types, including human, cat, kitten, rabbit, pigeon, fish, and lobster, to study post-tetanic tremor. They discovered that a tremor could be demonstrated in all types of muscles, with an average periodicity between two and six or eight per second. The study also found that the post-tetanic tremor is a myogenic phenomenon and is a protective mechanism against the fatal effects of full muscle fatigue.
