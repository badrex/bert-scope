tldr: This study investigates the kinetics of the acid and alkaline hydrolysis of methyl fluoride in water. The authors found that the reaction proceeds to completion at all temperatures and is predominantly of the first order. They also discovered that the reaction rate is influenced by the presence of additional solutes, such as hydrofluoric acid, methyl alcohol, and potassium bromide. The authors propose a kinetic scheme that incorporates these observed effects and explain the reaction's behavior in terms of activation energy and the stability of the activated complex.
