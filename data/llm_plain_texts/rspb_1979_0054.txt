tldr: This article examines the potential role of trace metals, specifically cobalt, cadmium, and lead, in the development of cardiovascular disease. The author discusses the effects of these metals on blood pressure, myocardial disease, and atherosclerosis. The study concludes that cobalt is unlikely to play a significant role in cardiovascular disease, while cadmium has notable effects on blood pressure in animals, and there is some evidence linking environmental lead exposure to high blood pressure.
