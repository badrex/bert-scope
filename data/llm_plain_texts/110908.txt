tldr: The author, John Goodsir, discusses the development and functions of the supra-renal, thymus, and thyroid bodies. He hypothesizes that these organs are remnants of the blastoderma and are involved in similar processes as the blastoderma, such as elaborating and absorbing nutrients for the embryo. He also describes the specific relationships of these organs to the blood vessels and the functions they perform.
