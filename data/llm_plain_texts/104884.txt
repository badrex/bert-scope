tldr: This article presents a case study of Margaret Cutting, a woman who can speak distinctly despite having lost the apex and body of her tongue. The author, James Parsons, examines her condition and discusses the role of the tongue in speech, as well as the contributions of the lips, teeth, and other parts of the mouth in articulating sounds. He concludes that the ability to speak without the tongue's apex and body is not as extraordinary as it may seem, given the various organs and muscles involved in speech production.
