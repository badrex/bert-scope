tldr: The author describes a new type of concave burning speculum made in Germany, which can concentrate heat to an incredible degree. The speculum can melt various materials, including wood, metal, and stone, and has potential applications in the creation of pastes or factitious jewels. The author also mentions experiments with the full moon's beams, which did not produce any heat.
