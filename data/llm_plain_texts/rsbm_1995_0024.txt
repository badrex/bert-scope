tldr: The article discusses the life and scientific contributions of Roman Mieczyslaw Sawicki, a renowned entomologist known for his research on insecticide resistance and the development of synthetic pyrethroids. Sawicki's work involved studying the insecticidal activity of natural pyrethrum and conducting bioassays to determine the effectiveness of synergists like piperonyl butoxide. His research played a significant role in the development of new strategies to prevent insecticide resistance.
