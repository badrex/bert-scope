tldr: The authors studied the infra-red absorption bands of stretching vibrations in a series of meta- and para-substituted anilines. They found that the effect of substituent groups on the frequencies and intensities of the bands can be correlated with their Hammett factors. The study also examined the influence of solvents on vibration frequencies, band intensities, and band shapes, providing insights into intermolecular interactions.
