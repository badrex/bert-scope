tldr: The authors study the spatial struggle between tit-for-tat and defect strategies in a population of players. They find that stable coexistence of both players is possible, and that spatial patterns can form when constant distributions are unstable. The model shows that a small number of tit-for-tat players can invade a population of defectors, suggesting that a mutation to tit-for-tat may lead to a population of defectors being displaced.
