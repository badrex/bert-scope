tldr: The author investigates the formation and growth of pearls, concluding that they are formed on the external surface of an ovum that does not pass into the oviduct. Pearls grow slowly due to their concentric layers of nacre and can only be found in full-grown oysters. The author also discusses the unique properties of natural pearls and their differences from artificial ones.
