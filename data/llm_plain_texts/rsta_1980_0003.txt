tldr: The authors develop an electrostatic model to explain ligand field splittings observed in core level photoelectron spectra of main group compounds. They show that these splittings originate from the asymmetric part of the ligand field and can be divided into two terms: the valence term and the point charge or ligand term. The authors calculate these splittings for various elements and compare their results with experimental data, finding reasonable agreement. They also explore the importance of Sternheimer shielding-antishielding parameters on both core electronic splitting and nuclear splitting.
