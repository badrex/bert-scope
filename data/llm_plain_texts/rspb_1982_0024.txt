tldr: The authors propose a state-motion-state (SMS) moving shape representation for the analysis of movements of 3D shapes. This representation is based on segmenting a movement at moments when a component axis, such as an arm, starts to move relative to its local coordinate frame. The SMS representation is an extension of the Mar & Nishihara (1978) 3D model representation of static shapes, and it is suitable for recognizing and representing movements of objects and actions.
