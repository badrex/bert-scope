  - Negative Quantities
tldr: The author, John Warren, extends the geometrical representations of quantities with square roots of negative quantities, enabling the representation of all algebraic quantities by lines in the same plane. This work builds upon his previous research and addresses various equivalent formulae for specific cases.
