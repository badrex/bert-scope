tldr: The authors studied the thermal decomposition of nitrous oxide and its catalysis by nitric oxide. They discovered that the reaction involves two activation mechanisms: a low-pressure first-order reaction and a high-pressure bimolecular reaction. The authors also found that nitric oxide catalyzes the decomposition of nitrous oxide. This research contributes to the understanding of chemical kinetics and the role of catalysts in reactions.
