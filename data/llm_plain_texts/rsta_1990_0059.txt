tldr: This article explores the potential role of large, fast-sinking particles, such as marine snow, in clearing deep-sea nepheloid layers. The authors argue that these particles could play a significant role in the deposition process, similar to the wet deposition process in the atmosphere. They discuss the importance of understanding the dynamics of nepheloid layers and the potential impact of particulate rain on sediment transport in the deep sea.
