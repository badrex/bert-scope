tldr: The authors discovered that Bacterium Zopfii, a microorganism with a unique feather-like growth pattern, exhibits regular growth when exposed to gravity and irregular growth when not. They found that the growth patterns were not affected by light or temperature, but were influenced by the medium's thickness and the presence of reflecting surfaces. This research sheds light on the chemotactic and physiotactic properties of protoplasm and has implications for understanding microbial growth patterns.
