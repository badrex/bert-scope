tldr: This study investigates the effect of diethyl ether on the in vitro luminescent reaction of Vibrio fischeri. The results show that ether inhibits the binding of the aldehyde factor necessary for luminescence and may also act as a second site where its presence stimulates the binding of reduced flavin to the enzyme. The findings provide insights into the mechanisms of general anaesthetics and their effects on bacterial luminescence.
