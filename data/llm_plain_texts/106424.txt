tldr: Peter Dollond developed an apparatus to correct the errors in telescope observations caused by atmospheric refraction. He used two lenses, one convex and one concave, to counteract the refraction and maintain the accuracy of the telescope's observations. This method allowed for more precise measurements of stars and planets, even when they were close to the horizon.
