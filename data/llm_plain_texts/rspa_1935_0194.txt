tldr: This article investigates the effect of resonance radiation imprisonment on the decomposition of ammonia and deutero-ammonia. The authors found that resonance radiation imprisonment significantly affects the reaction rates, and that the decomposition of deutero-ammonia is more susceptible to inhibition than ammonia. The study provides insights into the secondary reactions responsible for the reactivity of these molecules.
