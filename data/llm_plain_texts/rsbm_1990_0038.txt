tldr: 'Arthur Ramsay was a renowned comparative physiologist who revolutionized the field by developing innovative methods and tools for studying tiny structures, organs, and organisms. His work on the excretory systems of invertebrate animals provided profound insights into their functional organization. Ramsay also made significant contributions to thermodynamics, writing a guide that made the subject more accessible to biologists. As an educator, he lectured on various aspects of zoology and edited the leading journal in comparative physiology, The Journal of Experimental Biology, for 21 years.'
