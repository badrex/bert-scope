tldr: The author, A.B. Kempe, discusses the concept of "aspects" in mathematical form and provides amendments to his previous memoir on the topic. Aspects are mental marks given to units in a collection, and they play a crucial role in understanding the relationships between different units. The author also explains how aspects can be derived from each other and how they can be used to analyze various collections of units.
