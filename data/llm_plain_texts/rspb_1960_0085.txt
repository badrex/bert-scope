tldr: The author's study investigates the role of vertical lobes in Octopus learning, specifically visual and tactile discriminations. The results show that after the removal of the vertical lobes, octopuses can still learn within sessions but have difficulty setting up long-lasting representations in their memory. This indicates that the main function of the vertical lobes is storing representations, and they may also assist in forming stores in other areas, such as the optic lobes.
