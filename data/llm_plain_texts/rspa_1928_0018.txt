tldr: The author presents a restored electron theory of metals and thermionic emission. They find that the best determinations of electronic emission for pure metals like tungsten, molybdenum, tantalum, and platinum agree with a value of 60 amperes per square centimeter. However, metals affected by surface impurities require smaller values, as low as 3 amperes per square centimeter. The author also discusses the reflection coefficient and its relation to surface layers and temperature ranges.
