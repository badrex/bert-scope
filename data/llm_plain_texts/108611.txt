tldr: The author, E. Frankland, conducted research on organometallic bodies and discovered a new series of organic acids containing nitrogen. By replacing oxygen with an organic radical, he synthesized a new compound, which he named dinitroethylic acid. This discovery expanded the understanding of organometallic compounds and their potential applications.
