tldr: The authors conducted a photographic investigation of flame movements in carbonic oxide-oxygen explosions. They used a high-speed photographic machine to study the effects of varying conditions, such as "dryness," source and intensity of ignition, and the influence of superimposed shock waves on flame velocities and detonation in moist 2CO + 02 mixtures.
