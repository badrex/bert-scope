tldr: This article presents an experimental investigation of the thermo-dynamical properties of superheated steam. The authors study the flow of steam through an orifice and the cooling effect of the steam. They find that the cooling effect is inversely proportional to the absolute temperature and that the specific heat at constant pressure is a crucial property of superheated steam. The results of this research can be used to calculate the specific volumes of superheated steam under various conditions of pressure and temperature.
