tldr: The authors conducted a combined electron-microscopic and biochemical study on the disintegration of isolated mitochondria from asynchronous flight muscle of the blowfly, Calliphora erythrocephala. They observed the fragmentation of the mitochondria and the behavior of the resulting smaller fragments. The study provides insights into the structure and function of mitochondria and their components.
