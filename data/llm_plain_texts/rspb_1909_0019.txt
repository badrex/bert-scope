tldr: This article investigates the correlation between the gametic constitution of ancestors and the resulting offspring in a Mendelian population. The author demonstrates that the correlation coefficients remain constant across generations and are influenced by the dominance principle. The findings suggest that the relationship between gametic and somatic constitutions may be more complex than previously thought.
