tldr: This article discusses the change in electrical resistance of iron and steel due to magnetization. The author, Professor W. G. Adams, presents a preliminary notice on the findings of Herbert Tomlinsoll's experiments. The results show that the resistance of iron and steel changes with magnetization, and the relationship between the resistance and magnetization is explored for different materials.
