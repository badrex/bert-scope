tldr: The authors re-measured and analyzed the vibration-rotation bands of acetylene to determine more accurate molecular constants and bond lengths. They found that the new values for the molecular vibrations are consistent with previous research on isotopic acetylenes, providing a better understanding of the molecule's dimensions and valency theories.
