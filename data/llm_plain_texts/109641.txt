tldr: The author, William Hyde Wollaston, investigates the formation of fairy-rings in grass fields. He observes that fungi are always found at the outer edge of the dark ring and hypothesizes that the rings form through progressive enlargement from a central point. The soil's exhaustion from fungi growth leads to the grass's luxuriance. When two circles intersect, they are obliterated, supporting the hypothesis. The author also notes that different fungi species require the same nutrients.
