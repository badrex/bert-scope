tldr: The author investigates the Euler-Lagrange equations for a Lagrange density that includes the metric tensor, its first two derivatives, and a vector field. They find that the only equations of this type that are second-order in the metric tensor and first-order in the vector field are the Einstein field equations with an energy-momentum term. Various conditions are obtained under which the Einstein-Maxwell field equations become an inevitable consequence.
