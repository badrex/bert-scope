tldr: This article investigates the process of degassing nickel and the diffusion of carbon monoxide through it. The authors found that degassing is a slow process and is incomplete even after hours. They also discovered that the controlling factor in the rate of degassing is the diffusion of carbon from the interior of the metal to the surface. The study provides insights into the behavior of gases in metals and their applications in various industries.
