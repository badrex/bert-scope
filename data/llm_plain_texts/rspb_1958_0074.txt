tldr: The article discusses the physiology and biochemistry of lactation, focusing on the process of milk removal. It explains that milk ejection is regulated by a neuroendocrine mechanism involving the posterior-pituitary gland and the secretion of the oxytocin hormone. This hormone causes contraction of the myoepithelial tissue of the breast, leading to the expulsion of milk. The article also reviews previous hypotheses on milk removal and presents evidence against them, supporting the neuroendocrine mechanism as the primary process for milk ejection.
