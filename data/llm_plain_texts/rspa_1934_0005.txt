tldr: The author presents a mathematical analysis of the mass of elementary particles, such as protons and electrons, using a quadratic equation and the concept of the cosmological constant. The study connects the mass of particles with the wave tensor calculus and explores the relationship between space vectors and mixed wave tensors.
