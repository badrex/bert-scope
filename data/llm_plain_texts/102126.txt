tldr: The author, Anthony Leewenhoek, examines the structure and composition of the brain in various animals, focusing on the cortical and medullary parts. He observes the presence of numerous blood vessels and transparent globules, which he believes play a role in the brain's function and appearance. Leewenhoek's detailed observations contribute to the understanding of brain anatomy and the role of blood vessels in the brain.
