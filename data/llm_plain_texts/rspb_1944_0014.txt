tldr: The author discusses the biosynthesis of thyroxine, a hormone produced by the thyroid gland, and its immunochemistry. They present evidence supporting the formation of thyroxine from diiodotyrosine and its role as the circulating thyroid hormone. The author also explores the mechanism by which thyroxine exercises its effects in the body and the development of a new technique for building artificial antigenic complexes to study thyroxine's physiological action.
