tldr: The authors correct an error in their previous paper on nonlinear stability of boundary layers. They provide alterations and reinterpretations to address the fault and minor misprints. The paper focuses on the nearly neutral state of the boundary layer and the relationship between wavenumber, Reynolds number, and frequency. The authors thank Dr. P. Hall, Professor J. T. Stuart, and Dr. R. J. Bodonyi for their contributions to the work.
