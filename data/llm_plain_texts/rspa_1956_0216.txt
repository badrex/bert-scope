tldr: The authors present a statistical approach to understand the dielectric polarization of polar substances. They derive a general expression for the static dielectric constant and expand it as a series in powers of the mean molecular polarizability. The study separates long-range and short-range effects and finds that it is not legitimate to represent the surroundings of a macroscopic sample with a continuum. The results are applied to experimental data for water and other liquids, providing satisfactory outcomes.
