tldr: This article discusses the structure of the recall process in human memory, focusing on the fragment model. The fragment model suggests that memory traces can be distinguished as different types of fragments, and recall is by direct access, contingent on the presence of overlap between the fragment and the retrieval cue. The model predicts a structure for the observed patterns of recall and has been applied successfully to various types of material.
