tldr: 'Kurt Albin Mothes was a pioneering plant physiologist who made significant contributions to the understanding of nitrogen metabolism in plants. His research focused on the formation and metabolism of alkaloids, detoxification of ammonia, transport of amino acids, and the role of cytokinins. Mothes also made notable contributions to plant physiology, biochemistry, and the study of nitrogen metabolism in eastern Europe. His work has had a lasting impact on the field of plant science.'
