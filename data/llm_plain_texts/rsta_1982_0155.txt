tldr: This article discusses the industrial applications of metal clusters in catalysis, focusing on the potential to bridge the gap between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. The author presents examples of their work in both areas, including the use of metal clusters for the synthesis of oxygenated products and the hydrogenolysis of aliphatic hydrocarbons. The article also explores the differences between supported metal cluster catalysts and those obtained by more conventional methods.
