tldr: The authors study eigenvalue problems for systems of linear ordinary differential equations and apply the method to analyze instabilities of solitary waves in nonlinear evolution equations. They establish instability criteria for the linear exponential instability of solitary wave solutions of generalized Korteweg-de Vries, -Mahoney, and regularized Boussinesq equations. The results clarify the mechanisms for the instability and provide insights into the behavior of solitary waves in these equations.
