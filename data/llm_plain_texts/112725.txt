tldr: The author presents an exposition of abstract m-dimensional geometry, discussing its extension from ordinary two- and three-dimensional geometries and its importance in analysis. The text explores the concept of k-fold relations and their representation through equations, with a focus on the twofold relation of a curve in space.
