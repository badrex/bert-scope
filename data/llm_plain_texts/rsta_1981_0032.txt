tldr: This article discusses the technique of magic angle spinning (MAS) in solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. It explains how rapid rotation of a solid sample at an angle to the Zeeman field direction can remove anisotropic interactions, such as magnetic dipolar, electric quadrupolar, and chemical shift interactions, from the NMR spectrum. This results in a narrowed spectrum with improved resolution, enabling the analysis of various materials, including powders, polymers, and metals. The article also highlights the effectiveness of combining MAS with other techniques, such as multiple-pulse and double resonance NMR methods, to obtain high-resolution spectra.
