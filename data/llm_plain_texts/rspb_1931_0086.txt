tldr: This study investigates the curariform action of quaternary ammonium salts on striated muscle and nerve conductivity. The authors compare the activities of various salts, including tetramethylammonium, alkyltrimethyl, and alkyltriethylammonium salts, and discuss the effects of replacing methyl and ethyl groups. They also explore the relationship between the rate of diffusion of the drug and the time of poisoning, using isolated nerve-sartorius preparations as a standard for comparison.
