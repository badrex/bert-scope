tldr: This article describes a case of a patient with multiple stones in the bladder. The author, Mr. Zollman, discusses the challenges of removing the stones and the unusual shape of one of the stones. He also speculates on how the stones were formed and how they remained in the bladder without causing significant discomfort for the patient. The case study provides an interesting medical curiosity for philosophers and lithotomists to consider.
