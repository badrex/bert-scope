tldr: The authors conducted a series of experiments to study the change in velocity during the propagation of ignition in explosive gaseous mixtures. They developed a new chronographic measurement method to accurately measure time intervals, which allowed them to analyze the acceleration period of explosions. The paper focuses on the methods used to minimize errors in the measurements and the potential applications of this research in understanding explosion mechanics.
