tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the electrical conductivity of thin rubidium films deposited on cooled pyrex glass surfaces. They found that the films had resistivities 10 times greater than the bulk metal, and their results were explained by a simple modification of J.J. Thomson's theory. The experiments provided reproducible results and helped explain the behavior of thin films in previous studies.
