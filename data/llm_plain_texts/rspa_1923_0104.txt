tldr: This article explores the crystalline structure of anhydrous racemic acid, a form of tartaric acid that is optically inactive due to equal numbers of right- and left-handed molecules. The authors use X-ray crystallography to study the arrangement of molecules in the crystal and determine that the anhydrous form has a triclinic pinakoidal structure. They also find that the crystal's habit, or shape, can help determine the positions of molecules within the crystal lattice.
