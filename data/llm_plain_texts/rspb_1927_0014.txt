tldr: This study investigates the viscous elastic properties of muscles and their response to different speeds of stretching and contracting. The authors use a new type of myograph to obtain accurate tension-length curves and analyze the results using various viscous-elastic models. The findings reveal that muscle behavior can be explained by a combination of elastic and viscous properties, which affect the muscle's response to stretching and contracting.
