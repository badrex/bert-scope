tldr: The author discusses the perturbations of the perissads (elements of uneven atomicity) and their relation to atomic weights. They analyze various mathematical curves and methods to understand these perturbations and present a polar form of the curve to better represent atomic weights and information that can be found in Newlands and Mendeleev's tables.
