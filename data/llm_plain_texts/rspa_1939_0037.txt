tldr: The authors present a mathematical analysis of the flexure and torsion problems of a shaft with an internally cracked cross-section. They use complex variables and harmonic functions to derive equations for the stresses and displacements in the shaft, taking into account the effects of Poisson's ratio and the centroid of the cross-section. The study provides a foundation for understanding the behavior of cracked shafts and can be applied to engineering design and maintenance.
