tldr: The author investigates the interaction between albuminous substances and saline solutions, discovering that albuminous fluids can be drawn down into heavier saline solutions and vice versa. This process, called "intertraction," can be observed in various types of receptacles and is influenced by the concentration of salt and albuminous substances. The author also discusses the potential applications of these findings in wound healing and infection treatment.
