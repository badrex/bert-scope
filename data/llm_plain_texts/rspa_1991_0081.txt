tldr: This paper discusses the concept of negative fractal dimensions in random multifractal measures and the limitations of the thermodynamic formalism. It explores the properties of these measures, including their fine-grained multifractal properties, partition function formalism, and coarse-grained multifractal properties. The paper also highlights the distinction between geometric scaling and analytic scaling in multifractal analysis and the limitations of using the partition function in defining multifractal properties.
