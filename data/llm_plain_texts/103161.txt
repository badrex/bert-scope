tldr: 'A letter from Ralph Thoresby describes a severe hailstorm that hit Rotherham and its surroundings in Yorkshire on June 7, 1710. The storm caused significant damage to glass windows, trees, and crops, particularly wheat and rye. The hailstones were as large as 5 inches in circumference and had an oblong shape. The storm's impact was felt over a half-mile wide, with the surrounding areas experiencing no hail but heavy rain. The letter provides a firsthand account of the damage and its effects on the local population.'
