tldr: The authors discovered a buoyancy mechanism in cranchid squid, which allows them to maintain near-neutral buoyancy in seawater. The large coelom in these squid is filled with a fluid that has a lower density than seawater, providing enough lift to balance the denser tissues of the animal. The coelomic fluid is nearly iso-osmotic with seawater, and its low density is mainly due to being a solution of ammonium chloride in water. This buoyancy mechanism is likely used by all Cranchidae species.
