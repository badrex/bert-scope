tldr: The author, Anthony van Leeuwenhoek, observed white matter on the tongues of feverish persons and conducted experiments to study its composition. He discovered various particles and long, slender structures, some as long as a human hair. He also found small animalcules in the water where the tongue matter was placed, suggesting they might feed on the particles. These observations contributed to the understanding of the human body and the role of microorganisms in health and disease.
