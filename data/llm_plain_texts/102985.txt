tldr: In this article, Anthony van Leeuwenhoek describes his observations of crystal structures and salt particles using a microscope. He discovers that the so-called "wild crystal" is mostly composed of salt and that these salt particles have various shapes and sizes. He also observes that when the crystal is dissolved in water and heated, it forms an incredible number of small salt particles, which can coagulate and form new crystal structures.
