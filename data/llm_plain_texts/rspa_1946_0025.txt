tldr: This article investigates the effects of various salts on the hydrogen-oxygen reaction, focusing on the first and third explosion limits. The authors found that salts with high chain-breaking efficiency, such as potassium chloride, significantly affect the reaction rate. They also discovered that iodides, like cesium iodide, show unique behavior and may introduce more profound changes into the reaction mechanism. The study highlights the importance of considering surface chemistry and the role of salts in controlling the rate of branching and destruction of chain carriers in the reaction.
