tldr: The study examines the habits and structure of Pseudapocryptes lanceolatus, a fish species in the early stages of adapting to aerial respiration. The fish is found in the Ganges estuary and is able to survive out of water by burrowing in wet mud and using its pectoral fins to move on land. The fish has a unique structure that allows it to breathe air through its opercular chamber, which acts as a lung. This adaptation helps the fish survive in environments with low oxygen levels in the water.
