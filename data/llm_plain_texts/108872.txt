tldr: In this lecture, John Tyndall discusses his research on radiant heat and its interaction with liquids and their vapors. He developed an apparatus to study the absorption and emission of heat by different molecules and found that the state of aggregation significantly affects their behavior towards radiant heat. This research contributes to understanding the relations between matter and the ether, which is essential for the future of natural philosophy.
