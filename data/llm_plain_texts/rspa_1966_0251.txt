tldr: This article investigates the stability of infinite periodic sequences of noncoplanar dislocation-type cracks in materials. The study examines the interaction between cracks under different modes of deformation, such as anti-plane strain, plane strain shear, and plane strain tension. The authors determine the criteria for complete fracture and the effects of crack distribution on the material's stability.
