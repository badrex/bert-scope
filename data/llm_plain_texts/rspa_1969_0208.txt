tldr: This article presents a detailed study of twinning modes in lattices, focusing on the seven different classes of twinning modes and their properties. The authors apply a generalized theory of twinning shears to specific lattices, providing examples of all seven classes of twinning modes for cubic lattices and discussing their characteristics. The study also compares these modes with the operative modes in crystalline materials in general and metals in particular, highlighting the importance of understanding twinning modes in material science.
