tldr: The author investigates the formation and decomposition of nitrous acid, examining its properties and reactions with nitric acid. They develop a method to estimate the amounts of nitrous and nitric acids in presence of one another and study the stability of nitric acid in absence of nitrous acid. The research provides insights into the conditions that cause the formation of nitrogen peroxide in nitric acid and the effects of temperature on the decomposition of nitric acid.
