tldr: The authors discovered that metal cations can initiate the polymerization of N-carboxy-\#x3B1;-amino acid anhydrides, leading to the formation of cyclic polypeptides and substituted hydantoin 3-acetic acids. This new type of reaction enhances the basic nature of the nitrogen atom in the anhydride's heterocyclic ring, allowing for the development of appreciable basic character. The study provides insights into the mechanism of these reactions and expands the understanding of peptide synthesis.
