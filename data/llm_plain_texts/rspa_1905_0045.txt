tldr: This article investigates the elastic properties of steel at high temperatures, finding that steel behaves more like rubber or glass when stressed at elevated temperatures. The authors discovered a time-lag between stress and strain in steel and iron at temperatures of 600Â°C and above, which can cause energy dissipation and affect the determination of Young's modulus.
