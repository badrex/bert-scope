tldr: James Wardrop's research focuses on the influence of respiratory organs in regulating the quantity of blood within the heart. He explains how various modes of respiration, such as laughter, crying, and sighing, can affect the circulation and action of the heart. The collapse of the lungs and chest walls during expiration helps transmit arterial blood from the lungs into the left cavities of the heart, promoting its passage into the aorta.
