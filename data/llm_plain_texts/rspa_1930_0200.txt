tldr: This article investigates the sorption of carbon tetrachloride at low pressures by activated charcoals. The authors examine the effects of varying evacuation temperatures and the role of adsorbed oxygen on the isothermals. They also test the validity of Pirani gauge pressure readings and find evidence of discontinuities and breaks in the isothermals. The results provide insights into the behavior of activated charcoals and their sorptive capacities.
