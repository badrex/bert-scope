tldr: The author, Thomas Wharton Jones, investigates the caudal heart of the eel, which was discovered by Dr. Marshall Hall. Jones proves that the caudal heart is part of the lymphatic system, not the blood-vascular system. The heart propels lymph into the caudal vein, which influences and accelerates the flow of blood in the vein. This discovery helps clarify the function of the caudal heart and its role in the eel's circulatory system.
