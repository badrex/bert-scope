tldr: Dr. Thomas Young investigates the motion of fluids in pipes, focusing on the effects of friction, resistance, and flexure. He develops a formula to calculate fluid velocities and compares it with previous works by Dubuat and Gerstner. The study also covers impulse propagation through elastic tubes, the magnitude of pulsations in conical vessels, and the effects of progressive contraction along a canal.
