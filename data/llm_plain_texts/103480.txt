tldr: In 1723, William Saunderson observed a comet in Bombay and recorded its position and movement. Dr. Halley, who communicated the observations, also observed an eclipse of the Moon in Gomroon, Persia in 1724. These observations contributed to the understanding of celestial events during the early modern era.
