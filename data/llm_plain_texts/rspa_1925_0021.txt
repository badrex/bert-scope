tldr: The authors investigate the reproducibility and periodic changes in the catalytic activity of copper films. They explain that the catalyst's stability is due to the growth of granules of copper and diminishing granules of oxide during oxidation and reduction processes. The authors also discuss the effect of temperature on the catalyst's activity and the role of surface orientation in the catalytic decomposition of substances.
