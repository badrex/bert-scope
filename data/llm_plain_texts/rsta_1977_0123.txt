tldr: This article discusses the role of aqueous phase in sedimentary geochemistry, focusing on the processes of weathering, diagenesis, and erosion. It highlights the importance of clay minerals in sedimentary environments and presents a comprehensive account of the chemical reactions occurring at each stage of the surface cycle. The study emphasizes the influence of an aqueous phase on geological evolution and provides insights into the composition of soil profiles and weathering processes in different environments.
