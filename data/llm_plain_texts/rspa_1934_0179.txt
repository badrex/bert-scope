tldr: The authors compare two approximation methods, Jeffreys' and Born's, for calculating phases in electron scattering. They calculate phases for 121-volt electrons in krypton using both methods and compare the results with Holtsmark's exact phases. The study shows that Jeffreys' approximation generally gives slightly higher values, but the difference between the methods is small, demonstrating the success of the approximations.
