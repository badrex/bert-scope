tldr: The author, Alexander Wilson, shares his observations of solar spots and their changes over time. He suggests that these spots may be excavations in the sun's luminous matter, with the nucleus being the bottom and the umbra being the shelving sides. This theory is based on the unique changes observed in the spot's figure and umbra, which he believes could be due to the spot's position and rotation on the sun's axis.
