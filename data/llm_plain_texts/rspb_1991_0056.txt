tldr: The author discusses two types of male-killing cytoplasmic genes: early male killers that target embryos and late male killers that target larvae. Early male killing is explained through kin selection, where the death of male embryos allows resources to be redirected to surviving females with clonal relatives of the male-killing cytoplasmic gene. Late male killing factors in mosquitoes have both vertical and horizontal transmission between generations. The variety of mosquito-microsporidian pathologies is interpreted as a trade-off between the efficiency of vertical and horizontal transmission.
