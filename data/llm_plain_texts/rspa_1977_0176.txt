semantic_tags:
  - Thermal explosions
  - Reactant consumption
  - Heat balance
  - Arrhenius equation

tldr: The article discusses the criteria for thermal explosions with and without reactant consumption. It explores the heat balance and reaction rates, and introduces the dimensionless parameters that help understand the critical behavior of thermal systems. The author also compares different approximations to the Arrhenius term and their effects on the analysis of thermal explosions.
