tldr: This article presents a theoretical study of the thermo-mechanical response of rubberlike materials, focusing on the formulation of constitutive equations. The authors derive an expression for the Helmholtz free energy of the material and introduce two assumptions to characterize its behavior. They then investigate the extension of a cylindrical specimen under prescribed conditions, comparing theoretical predictions with observed behavior. The study demonstrates that a rational macroscopic theory of rubberlike thermoelasticity can be developed in general terms, providing a foundation for further research in this area.
