tldr: 'The study investigates the use of lymphoblastoid interferon to treat chronic hepatitis B virus infection. The treatment resulted in a decrease in HBV-DNA polymerase and HBV-DNA in all three patients. However, HBsAg and HBeAg remained positive. Interferon side effects were manageable, and lymphoblastoid interferon appears to be a potential candidate for further treatment trials in chronic HBV infection.'
