tldr: This study investigates the magnetic properties of iron and the effect of an electric current on its retraction. The author found that the maximum magnetic elongation in an iron wire with a current is greater than without a current, and the retraction in strong fields is less. The magnetic retraction of nickel and cobalt is not significantly affected by the passage of a current. The experiments also show that the time required for the current to become uniform is nearly inversely proportional to the impressed electromotive force (EMF).
