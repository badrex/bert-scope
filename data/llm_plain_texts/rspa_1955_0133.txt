tldr: The authors developed a method to study hydrogenation reactions on metal surfaces using an iron septum. They found that the rate of hydrogen emergence from the active surface can be represented by a mathematical equation. The study also showed that molecular oxygen can block part of the iron surface, while molecular nitrogen does not react with hydrogen or block its permeation. This research provides insights into the behavior of hydrogen and other gases on metal surfaces in catalytic reactions.
