tldr: The author examines the structure and function of various muscles in the upper extremity, specifically focusing on the pectoralis major, coraco-brachialis, deltoid, teres major, and latissimus dorsi muscles. They explain the unique adaptations in these muscles' structure and actions, which allow for diverse and precise movements. The author also discusses methods for determining muscle strength, proposing the use of Mr. Daniell's new battery for galvanism.
