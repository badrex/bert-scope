tldr: The author examines a well-preserved specimen of the Ordovician trilobite Placoparia cambriensis, providing insights into its anatomy and soft tissue preservation. The discovery of preserved antennae, partial infilling of the alimentary canal, and intersegmental bars suggests new understanding of trilobite musculature and the role of enrolment in their protective reactions.
