tldr: The authors investigated the relationship between ionized calcium and cortical granule exocytosis in sea urchin eggs. They found that increasing ionized calcium concentrations led to a higher rate of cortical granule exocytosis. This process is essential for egg fertilization and the formation of a protective fertilization membrane around the egg. The study used a technique that made holes in the egg's plasma membrane to allow the rapid exchange of substances and better understand the role of calcium in exocytosis.
