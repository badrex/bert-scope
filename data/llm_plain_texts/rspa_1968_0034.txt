tldr: This article explores the behavior of wavetrains in inhomogeneous moving media, focusing on the changes in amplitude and frequency along the rays. The authors introduce the concept of wave action density and demonstrate how it can be used to calculate changes in amplitude in a slowly varying medium. They also discuss the connection between wave packets and the adiabatic invariant, which is analogous to the conservation of energy in a classical simple harmonic oscillator.
