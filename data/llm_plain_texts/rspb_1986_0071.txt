tldr: This study investigates how insects, such as mantids, perceive and detect objects using velocity parallax. Insects make peering movements to measure the range of objects and can estimate distance even when the background is moving. The research suggests that a two- or three-stage feedback mechanism, based on velocity parallax, helps insects perceive objects and navigate their environment.
