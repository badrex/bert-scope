tldr: The authors study the morphology and classification of coccospheres and rhabdospheres, which are calcareous structures produced by marine algae. They describe the overlapping arrangement of coccoliths in coccospheres, which provides a protective armor, and the structure of rhabdoliths in rhabdospheres. The authors also discuss the challenges in collecting and preserving these organisms and propose a new species, Coccosphera leptopora, based on their observations.
