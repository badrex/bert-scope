tldr: The article presents an analysis of two mineral substances, Rowleyrag-Stone and Toad-Stone, by William Withering. The Rowleyrag-Stone is found in Staffordshire and is used for road maintenance and paving. The Toad-Stone comes from Derbyshire and has a granulated texture. The author discovers that Rowleyrag-Stone consists of siliceous earth, clay, or earth of alum, and calx of iron, while Toad-Stone has a similar composition but lacks the calciform iron. The study suggests that Rowleyrag-Stone might be used as a flux for calcareous iron ores.
