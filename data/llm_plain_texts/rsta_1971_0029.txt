tldr: This article presents a theoretical study on the motion of space charge in dielectric media. The authors derive a general equation to describe the spatio-temporal behavior of space charge in an ideal dielectric medium and apply it to a parallel plate capacitor with space charges near its electrodes. They discuss symmetrical and asymmetrical charge distributions and their effects on the potential difference and external current.
