tldr: The author discusses the importance of understanding the true derivation of analytical expressions and the use of integral equations. They argue that relying on indirect methods, such as geometric considerations, can lead to confusion and incorrect notions. The author provides examples of how to derive expressions using a purely analytical approach, emphasizing the need to reverse the operations used to create the expressions.
