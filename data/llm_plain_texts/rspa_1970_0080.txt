tldr: This study investigates the thermoluminescence glow curves of various polyethylene samples and identifies five similar glow peaks. One peak is confirmed as electron trapping on molecular oxygen, while the remaining four peaks are associated with the polymer itself, specifically main chain unsaturation and defects in the folded and amorphous regions of the solid. The research also explores the effects of hexane treatment on glow curve shapes and the role of phosphorescence quenching in thermoluminescence measurements.
