tldr: This study examines the assumption that tree branching patterns are stationary and finds that they are not. The researchers analyzed four tree species and discovered two patterns of non-stationarity related to shoot development. They also found that average bifurcation ratios are not suitable for describing tree branching patterns, as they ignore important details of form and development. This challenges the widely held assumption that branching patterns in plants are stationary.
