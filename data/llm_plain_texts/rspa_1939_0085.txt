tldr: The authors studied the oxidation of carbon monoxide in the presence of small nitrogen peroxide concentrations and examined the influence of hydrogen on these mixtures. They found that the addition of hydrogen to carbon monoxide-oxygen-nitrogen peroxide mixtures can lead to explosions even at low temperatures. The results indicate that ignition in these mixtures is conditioned by a chain-branching mechanism similar to that responsible for nitrogen peroxide-sensitized ignition of oxy-hydrogen mixtures. The authors also discovered that adding water vapor to the sensitized gases introduces an ignition region similar to that found with traces of hydrogen, providing an example of ignition catalysis produced by the combined influence of two substances.
