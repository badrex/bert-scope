tldr: The author examines the concept of phyllotaxis, the arrangement of leaves on a plant stem, and its relation to growth in the plant's apex. They critique previous theories, such as Church's and Plantefol's, and propose a new method using polar coordinates to analyze the patterns found in plant apices. This method provides a more accurate and universal way to study phyllotaxis, regardless of the shapes of the primordia or whether they are in contact with one another.
