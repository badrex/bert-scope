tldr: The authors measured the thickness of liquid helium films using a new oscillation method. They found that the film thickness varied with height and studied the superfluid flow of the liquid helium film. This research aimed to understand the hydrodynamics of the mixture of normal and superfluid liquids in liquid helium.
