tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the physiological effects of various chinoline and pyridine bases on animals. They found that these bases primarily affect the nervous system, causing drowsiness, anesthesia, and weakening of reflex activity. The respiratory and circulatory systems are also affected, leading to decreased heart rate and respiratory movements. Additionally, the bases cause a drop in body temperature, which the authors believe is due to interference with nutritional changes between the blood and tissues.
