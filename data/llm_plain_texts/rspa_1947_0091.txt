tldr: The authors examine the accuracy of atomic co-ordinates in X-ray structure analysis using Fourier series, focusing on the two-dimensional projection of oxalic acid. They compare the results of Robertson and Woodward with those of Brill, Hermann, and Peters, and discuss the effectiveness of different methods for determining the structure. The study highlights the importance of using accurate techniques and considering the limitations of various methods in understanding the structure of molecules.
