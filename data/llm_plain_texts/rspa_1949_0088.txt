revised_title: 'Tidal Stream Effects on Wave Characteristics'
semantic_tags:
  - Wave mechanics
  - Tidal streams
  - Wave group velocity
  - Wave dispersion
  - Wave energy dissipation
tldr: The article discusses the behavior of waves in tidal streams, focusing on how waves change their characteristics as they pass through regions with streaming water. The authors provide experimental evidence to support their theory and explore the effects of tidal streams on wave group velocity, dispersion, and energy dissipation.
