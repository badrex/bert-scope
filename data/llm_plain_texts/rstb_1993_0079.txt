tldr: This article explores the aerodynamic properties of a bird's tail and how it contributes to flight and maneuverability. The author uses slender lifting surface theory to predict the lift and drag forces generated by the tail, and discusses the role of tail shape and tail spread in aerodynamic performance. The study also examines the evolution of elongated tails and how they may have evolved through sexual selection.
