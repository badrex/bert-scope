tldr: The authors studied the diseases caused by Trypanosoma capræ, a species of trypanosome, in domestic animals in Nyasaland. They found that the tsetse fly species G. morsitans is the carrier of this trypanosome, and it affects cattle, goats, and sheep. The trypanosome is part of the vivax group, which also includes Trypanosoma uniforme and Trypanosoma vivax. Monkeys, dogs, and smaller laboratory animals are immune to the disease. The authors also observed the development of the trypanosome in the tsetse fly and its impact on wild game living in the Nyasaland Sleeping-Sickness Area.
