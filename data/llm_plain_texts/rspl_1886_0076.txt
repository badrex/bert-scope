tldr: The author, William Crookes, discusses his research on the new elements found in gadolinite and samarskite through spectroscopic analysis. He discovered that didymium can be split into two new elements, praseodymium and neodymium, and identified a new element, dysprosium, based on its unique absorption spectrum. Additionally, he investigates the phosphorescent spectra of yttria and samaria, leading to the discovery of a new element associated with the orange line in their spectra.
