tldr: The author, Thomas Wharton Jones, studied the propulsion of lymph from the lymphatic hearts into veins in frogs. He observed that when the lymphatic heart contracts, a stream of lymph is propelled into a vein, pushing the blood in the vessel. This process is similar to the propulsion of lymph in eels. The author also noted that a large blackish vein, previously thought to be connected to the heart, is not directly related to it but is in close connection and moves with the heart's contractions.
