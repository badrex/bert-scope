tldr: This study investigates visual cues to age by using facial composites that blend shape and colour information from multiple faces. The research finds that perceived age of adult male faces is, on average, an accurate index of their chronological age. The techniques used provide an empirical definition of facial changes with age that are biologically consistent across a sample population. The perceived age of a blend of old faces is increased by exaggerating the RGB colour differences of each pixel relative to a blend of young faces.
