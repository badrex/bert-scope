tldr: The author, Charles Hutton, calculates the point on a hill where the gravitational attraction is the greatest. He uses mathematical models and various scenarios to determine the optimal location for measuring gravitational attraction on a hill. This research is essential for understanding the force of gravity and its effects on the Earth's surface.
