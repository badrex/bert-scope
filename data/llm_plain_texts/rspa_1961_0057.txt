tldr: The authors studied the lattice resonances of 16 ionic halides at extreme infra-red wavelengths using transmission and reflection experiments. They accurately determined the characteristic frequencies and degree of damping as a function of temperature, providing insights into dielectric behavior and refining the Born-Lorentz model. Their findings reveal discrepancies between theory and experiment, which have implications for calculating vibration spectra.
