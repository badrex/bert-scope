tldr: The authors investigate the influence of molecular constitution and temperature on magnetic susceptibility in crystalline media. They discuss the molecular field, its large intrinsic force, and its role in the rigidity of crystalline and gel-like materials. The study also explores the relationship between mechanical and molecular theory and its application to the understanding of ferromagnetic substances and crystallography.
