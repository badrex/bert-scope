revised_title: The Structure and Transformation of Quartz
semantic_tags:

  - Crystal transformation
  - Physical properties of quartz
tldr: The authors use X-ray analysis to study the structure of quartz and its transformation at 575°C. They discover that the hexagonal form of quartz has a simpler structure, which helps in determining the positions of atoms in the trigonal form. The study also examines the physical properties of quartz, such as its expansion coefficient, rotatory power, and refractive index, which change suddenly at the critical temperature.
