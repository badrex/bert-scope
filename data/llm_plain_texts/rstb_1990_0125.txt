tldr: The article discusses the 1986-1989 Desert Locust plague, which affected various regions in Africa, Arabia, and southwest Asia. The plague was caused by suitable breeding conditions and the movement of increasingly gregarious locust populations. Control efforts were hindered by inaccessible areas and restrictions on the use of persistent pesticides. The plague eventually declined due to a combination of adverse weather and control operations.
