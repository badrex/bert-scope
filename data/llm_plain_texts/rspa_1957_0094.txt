tldr: The authors studied the addition of methyl radicals to ethylene, propylene, and butenes. They found that the rate of addition is not affected by the length or shape of the hydrocarbon 'tail'. The results indicate that the increasing ease of addition for these olefines reflects the increasing stability of the produced radicals. The authors also determined the rates of abstraction of hydrogen atoms by methyl radicals and found that the rate constants for active hydrogen fall into three distinctive classes.
