tldr: This study investigates the weak chemiluminescence effects produced by the thermal decomposition of organic hydroperoxides in solution. Two types of emissions, a red form with a longer wavelength and a blue form from the liquid volume, are observed. The authors discuss the possible light-emitting processes and suggest that the red emission may be due to the catalytic decomposition of hydroperoxide, while the blue emission comes from a newly formed fluorescent product molecule.
