tldr: This study investigates the fluid loss and diuresis in newly emerged, unfed mosquitoes. The research shows that mosquitoes increase their preparedness for flight by losing water through enhanced excretion during the first day of their adult life. The findings suggest that a hormone from the head is involved in this process, as mosquitoes that are decapitated soon after emergence survive better than those decapitated later.
