tldr: This article explores the behavior of stellar winds and breezes, focusing on the mathematical and physical aspects of these phenomena. The authors discuss various types of solutions, including stellar winds and breezes, and examine how the base density and temperature of a star's corona determine the type of solution outside the star. They also consider the effects of stellar magnetism on plasma flow and the role of heat conduction and viscosity in these processes.
