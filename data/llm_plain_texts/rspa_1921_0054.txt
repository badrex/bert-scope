tldr: The author investigates the catalytic activity of copper in the decomposition of various alcohols. They find that the activity of the catalyst depends on the temperature of preparation from the oxide and the type of alcohol used. The results support the theory that metallic copper, produced by reduction of cuprous oxide, is the active agent in the catalytic process. The author also observes that the inactivity of "cupric" copper is due to its lack of adsorbing power for alcohol.
