tldr: The Earl of Morton and Dr. Wollaston observed a hybrid offspring resulting from breeding a quagga male with an Arabian mare. The offspring displayed a mix of characteristics from both parents, including stripes, coloration, and mane texture. This study highlights the complex inheritance of traits in hybrid animals and the potential for further research into animal breeding and genetics.
