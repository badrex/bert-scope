tldr: The author presents a method to derive asymptotic expansions for periodic Mathieu functions, which are solutions to the Mathieu differential equation. The expansions are valid for large values of the parameter h and can be used to study the behavior of Mathieu functions in various regions. The author also provides uniform expansions and discusses the special case of Mathieu functions of integer order.
