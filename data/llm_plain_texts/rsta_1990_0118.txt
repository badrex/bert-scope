tldr: The authors discuss the use of first principles variational calculations to study high-lying energy levels, wavefunctions, and transition intensities for triatomic molecules. They present theoretical developments and computational methods, including the use of generalized internal coordinates, two-step variational procedures, and the discrete variable representation. Illustrative calculations are shown for LiCN and a Van der Waals molecule. This research aims to understand large-amplitude motion and highly excited states of chemically bound systems.
