tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the resting oxygen intake while breathing concentrated oxygen mixtures. They found that even breathing nearly pure oxygen does not increase metabolism at rest, debunking previous theories that suggested increased oxygen pressure led to increased oxidation rates. The study used various techniques to measure oxygen consumption and concluded that there is no ground for believing that high percentage oxygen mixtures increase the rate of oxidation at rest.
