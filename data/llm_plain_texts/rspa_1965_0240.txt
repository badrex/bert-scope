tldr: This article discusses the observations of atmospheric ozone from an artificial Earth satellite. The authors found that the vertical distribution of ozone at heights between 40 and 70 km varies very little over a range of latitude up to 50 degrees from the equator. The results show that the vertical distribution of ozone is nearly constant over the range of heights, latitudes, and seasons sampled, indicating that ozone profiles remain stable in the stratosphere, mesosphere, and lower thermosphere.
