tldr: The author, Anthony van Lewenhoek, observed and described the movement and behavior of living creatures in the male reproductive fluid using a microscope. He found a vast number of these creatures, which he called "animalcula," swimming in the seminal vesicles and testicles. The author also discussed the differences between his observations and those of another scientist, who claimed to have discovered these creatures earlier.
