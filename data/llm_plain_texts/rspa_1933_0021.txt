tldr: 'The author introduces the concept of fiducial probability, a new approach to statistical inference that provides probability statements about unknown parameters without assuming a prior distribution. This method is contrasted with inverse probability, which relies on the assumption of a prior distribution. Fiducial probability offers a more robust and logical approach to making probability statements about unknown parameters, as it is based on the population of all possible random samples rather than a specific distribution assumption.'
