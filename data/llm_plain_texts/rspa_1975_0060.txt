tldr: The Arie14 experiment on the Ariel 4 satellite studied electromagnetic signals above the ionosphere, including man-made signals, impulsive noise from thunderstorms, and emissions from magnetospheric energetic charged particles. The satellite's orbit allowed for coverage of all geomagnetic latitudes and enabled the study of seasonal changes. Observations of the NAA wave field revealed complex and variable behavior, with significant amplification and absorption phenomena. The study provided insights into wave-particle interactions and the relationship between emissions and local energetic particle fluxes.
