tldr: This article discusses the phenomenon of supercooling in liquids and presents a theoretical explanation for it. The author reviews the recent advancements in understanding supercooling, particularly the work of Turnbull, and explains how the liquid state can be better understood through crystallography and thermodynamics. The article also explores the role of nucleation in the supercooling process and its implications for the behavior of different substances.
