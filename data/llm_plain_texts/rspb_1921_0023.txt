tldr: The author conducted experiments on mammalian nerve-muscle reflexes using break-shock stimulation. They discovered that a single break-shock can evoke a reflex contraction that surpasses the "maximal" twitch elicited by break-shock stimulation of the motor nerve in terms of tension and duration. The author also found differences in the contraction forms between break-shock reflexes and maximal twitches, suggesting that the centrifugal nervous impulses in the reflex are repetitive.
