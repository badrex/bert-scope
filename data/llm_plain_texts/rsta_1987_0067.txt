tldr: This study investigates the behavior of laminar pulsating flow through separation and into a separated region. It examines five interconnected regions, including the attached boundary layer, the neighborhood of separation, the separated shear layer, the wake, and the outer flow. The research uses flow visualizations, laser-Doppler velocimetry, and hot-wire anemometry to analyze the interaction of disturbing and natural frequencies in the flow. The findings challenge previous theoretical models of separation and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the complex phenomena involved.
