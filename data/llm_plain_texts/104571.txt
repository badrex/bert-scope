tldr: 'A letter from Dr. Doddridge describes two remarkable cases involving sheep and lambs. The first case is of a wether (castrated male sheep) that suckles a lamb, while the second case is of a monstrous lamb with two heads, four legs, and other unusual features. The letter provides a detailed account of the physical characteristics of the monstrous lamb and its anatomy.'
