tldr: The author presents new nonlinear virtual work equations for plane frames and applies them to analyze the stability and behavior of frames with inextensible members under axial and non-axial loading. The study establishes a stability discriminant, investigates eigenfunction critical modes, and discusses principles governing bifurcation and equilibrium paths of frames under general loading.
