tldr: The article describes the anatomy, ultrastructure, and electrophysiology of the labyrinth of Myxine, a type of hagfish. The labyrinth has a unique structure with only two ampullae and a single macula communis. The sensory cells in Myxine's labyrinth have a distinct kinocilium structure lacking the two central filaments. Electrophysiological analysis shows sensitive responses to angular acceleration and tilting, proving that the labyrinth has functional capabilities despite previous doubts.
