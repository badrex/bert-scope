tldr: This article explores the dynamics of host-parasite co-evolution using simple genetic models with varying numbers of genotypes in each species. The authors find that increasing the number of genotypes can lead to complex cycles and chaotic behavior, and that intermediate recombination rates may promote the accumulation of genetic variation involved in host-parasite interactions.
