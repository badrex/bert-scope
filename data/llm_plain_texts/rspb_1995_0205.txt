tldr: This study investigates the benefits of precocial maturity in male Soay sheep, focusing on the trade-offs between reproductive success and survival. The researchers found that hormonal castration reduced the time spent on mating activities, suggesting a cost of reproduction. They also used genetic paternity testing and a simulation model to understand the optimal age of maturity and the advantages of a precocial strategy in this species.
