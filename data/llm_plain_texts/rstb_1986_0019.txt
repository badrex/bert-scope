tldr: This study analyzes the flight behavior of free-flying houseflies, focusing on their visual control and performance. The research explores how houseflies navigate and interact with their environment, including their response to visual stimuli and the role of optomotor control in stabilizing their flight course. The findings provide insights into the complex mechanisms that govern insect flight and visual control systems.
