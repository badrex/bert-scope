tldr: The author, William Hyde Wollaston, discusses the duration of muscular action, the origin of sea-sickness, and the benefits of external motion. He observes that each muscle contraction consists of multiple contractions at short intervals and explains how the act of inspiration can help counteract the effects of sea-sickness. Wollaston also explores the role of external motion in assisting the circulation of blood and improving overall health.
