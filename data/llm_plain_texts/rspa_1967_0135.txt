tldr: The authors present a variational principle that leads to the March-Murray perturbation series, which relates the particle density to the one-body potential in an electron gas. They also derive an explicit form for the Hohenberg-Kohn universal functional, which is essentially the kinetic energy density. When the spatial variations of density and potential are slow, the usual Thomas-Fermi relation between kinetic energy density and particle density is regained. The approach also leads to a systematic formulation of the gradient expansion of the kinetic energy density.
