tldr: The author conducted experiments with various vegetable acids and the fossil or mineral alkali to create neutral salts. They discovered that different vegetable acids produce distinct neutral salts, indicating that these acids have unique properties and are not all the same. This research expanded the understanding of acid-base chemistry and the potential number of neutral salts.
