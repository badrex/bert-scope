tldr: The authors evaluate the atomic absorption and opacity coefficients in an enclosure containing free electrons with Fermi-Dirac statistics. They find that in a highly degenerate electron-gas, the atomic absorption and opacity coefficients are independent of electron concentration and density. This study has implications for understanding the structure of stars and the behavior of matter under extreme conditions.
