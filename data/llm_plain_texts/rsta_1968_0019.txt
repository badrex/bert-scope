tldr: This article discusses the impact of fluctuating noise levels on human perception and proposes methods for calculating the disturbance caused by varying noise amplitudes and durations in industrial environments. The author suggests that shorter noise durations allow for higher noise levels without causing the same level of annoyance, and provides examples of how different noise compositions affect human perception.
