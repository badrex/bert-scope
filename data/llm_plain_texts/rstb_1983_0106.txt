tldr: 'The authors investigate the biophysical mechanism of blue light suppression of plant growth, focusing on the effects of blue light on cell wall properties and hydraulic conductivity. They find that blue light inhibits stem elongation by influencing cell wall properties, and that the hydraulic conductivity of the growing tissue is large enough not to limit the rate of cell enlargement.'
