tldr: The article investigates properties of a congruence of time-like curves in general relativity using a projection technique. It focuses on rigid frames and their properties, such as curvature, rotation, and rate-of-strain. The authors also explore conditions for the extension of the Herglotz-Noether theorem and properties of isometric and irrotational rigid frames. The connection between rigid frames and certain types of motions is established.
