tldr: The author examines the tendinous intersection of the digastric muscle in various mammals, including humans. They observe that the tendinous intersection's form and function vary among species, but it is always present as a point of attachment for the tendinous raphe, which connects the digastric muscles of opposite sides. This study provides insight into the development and structure of the digastric muscle in mammals.
