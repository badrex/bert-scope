tldr: The author, George Gore, studied the molecular properties of antimony and its electrochemical deposition from different liquid solutions. He discovered two distinct varieties of antimony with different appearances, structures, and physical properties. The research also explored the electro-positive nature of amorphous antimony compared to the crystalline kind and their reduction of silver in a solution of nitrate of silver.
