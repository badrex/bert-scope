tldr: This study investigates the prevalence and importance of density dependence in tree populations in a species-rich neotropical forest in Panama. The authors analyze the static data on tree population density and dispersion from the primary census and map completed in 1982, as well as the short-term dynamic data on survival, growth, and recruitment obtained from the 1985 recensus. They conclude that density dependence plays a limited role in the maintenance of tree species diversity in the BCI forest, with only a few species experiencing strong density-dependent effects that prevent them from assuming complete dominance.
