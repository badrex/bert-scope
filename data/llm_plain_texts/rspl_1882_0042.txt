tldr: The authors discovered that the breath of persons affected with phthisis (tuberculosis) contains certain organized bodies, which are likely the bacillus of tubercle. They used a staining method to identify these bacilli in the condensed aqueous vapour of the breath. This finding suggests that particles contagious to susceptible individuals may be constantly breathed in, possibly leading to the spread of the disease.
