tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the phenomenon of acoustic reversibility and the failure of sound echoes in certain situations. They discovered that sound waves can only be effectively reflected and reversed when the source of sound is close to the object, and the object is far from the source. This finding helps explain the mystery of why some echoes were not heard during a famous experiment in 1822, and challenges the explanation given by Arago, a prominent French physicist.
