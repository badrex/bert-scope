  - Voltage-gated sodium channels
  - Voltage-gated potassium channels
tldr: Researchers discovered that rat astrocytes, a type of brain cell, have voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels similar to those found in neurons. These channels play a role in the spatial buffering of potassium, which helps maintain the balance of ions in the brain and supports neuronal function.
