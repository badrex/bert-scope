tldr: 'The study investigates the adsorption of bacteriophages by sensitive and resistant cells of Escherichia coli strain B. The adsorption isotherms of T2 and a tryptophan-requiring strain of T4 were measured on Escherichia coli B and mutant strains resistant to these bacteriophages. It was found that the susceptible host adsorbs the phages, while resistant strains do not adsorb any bacteriophage, indicating that resistance is due to external exclusion of the bacterial virus.'
