tldr: The article discusses the phytogeographical relationships of the northern islands of the New Hebrides, analyzing the distribution of major vegetation types and their structural classifications. The study reveals a disjunction at about 18Â° S latitude, dividing the island chain into northern and southern groups with an attenuation of complex vegetation types as latitude increases. The findings suggest that the New Hebrides cannot be compared as a whole with other geographic areas, and comparisons should be based on evaluations of the northern and southern islands as separate phytogeographic entities.
