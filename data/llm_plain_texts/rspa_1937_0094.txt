semantic_tags:
  - Quantum mechanics
  - Complex variables
  - Wave functions
  - Integration in quantum mechanics
  - Analytical continuation
tldr: The author explores the use of complex variables in quantum mechanics, showing that representing states and dynamical variables with complex variables can provide mathematical advantages and power for solving specific examples. The paper also discusses the integration process in quantum mechanics, including how to handle singularities and the role of analytical continuation.
