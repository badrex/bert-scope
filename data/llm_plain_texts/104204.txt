tldr: Dr. John Lining conducted daily statical experiments on himself for a year, recording his weight, urine, perspiration, and pulse rate. He aimed to discover the influences of different seasons on the human body and their connection to epidemic diseases. Lining's experiments provided insights into the changes in the human body during various seasons and the role of environmental factors in health.
