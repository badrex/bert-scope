tldr: The author examines the formation and reproduction of ova in different opossum tribes and the Ornithorhynchus. They discovered that the ova formation varies among these animals, with some having corpora lutea and others having yelk-bags. The author also found differences in the uterus, Fallopian tubes, and the process of impregnation and foetus development in these animals. This study helps to understand the links between different animal species in terms of their mode of generation.
