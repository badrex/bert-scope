tldr: The author describes a self-acting apparatus that can multiply and maintain electric charges, using water droplets to transfer charges between two Leyden jars. This device demonstrates the principles of electrostatics and can be used to illustrate the Voltaic Theory. The apparatus also shows an interesting analogy to self-sustaining electromagnetic systems.
