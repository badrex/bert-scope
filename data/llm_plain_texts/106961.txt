tldr: 'In 1795, William Herschel described his 40-feet reflecting telescope, a groundbreaking instrument that allowed for improved astronomical observations. The telescope's unique design and construction required significant investment and expertise in both mechanical and optical operations. Herschel's telescope enabled him to discover a sixth satellite of Saturn and observe the planet's spots more clearly than ever before.'
