tldr: 'The authors present a new method for measuring the double-refraction in strained glass by using a glass slab under flexure. This method allows for continuous observation of the double-refraction throughout the spectrum and provides a way to determine the absolute changes in the refractive indices of the polarized rays. The technique avoids the difficulties and delicate adjustments of previous methods, making it a more practical approach for studying the optical properties of strained glass.'
