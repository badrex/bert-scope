tldr: The author presents an analytical approach to Steiner's extension of Malfatti's problem, a geometric problem involving circles and triangles. The author provides a detailed analysis of the problem, including a lemma, geometrical construction, and equations for the solution. This work contributes to the understanding of analytical geometry and mathematical problem-solving techniques.
