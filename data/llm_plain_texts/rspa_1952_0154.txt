tldr: The authors study the noise generated by isotropic turbulence in a compressible fluid. They find that the noise is mainly produced by eddies that contribute little to the dissipation of kinetic energy by viscosity. The intensity of sound at large distances from the turbulence is the same as that due to a volume distribution of simple acoustic sources occupying the turbulent region. The local value of the acoustic power output per mass of turbulent fluid is given approximately by the formula S, where S is a numerical constant, u' is the mean-square velocity fluctuation, f is the frequency, and c is the velocity of sound in the fluid.
