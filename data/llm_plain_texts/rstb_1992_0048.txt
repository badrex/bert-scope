tldr: 'The article explores how nucleotide hydrolysis affects the dynamics of actin filaments and microtubules in eukaryotic cells. Nucleotide hydrolysis is linked to the destabilization of these structures and is uncoupled from polymerization. The study provides insights into the regulation of cytoskeletal assembly and the role of metal ions and nucleotide binding in the process.'
