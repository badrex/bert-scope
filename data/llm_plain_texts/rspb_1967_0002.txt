tldr: The study investigates the growth and chemical development of the pig's brain and spinal cord from 52 days of gestation to 3 years of age. The brain grows faster than the spinal cord, with the most rapid growth period lasting from 50 days before birth to 40 days after. The research provides insights into the effects of stress on the development of the central nervous system and has implications for understanding diseases affecting newborn piglets.
