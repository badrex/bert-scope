tldr: The author investigates the resistance to torsion of certain forms of shafting, particularly focusing on the effect of keyways. They extend previous work by De Saint-Venant and use conjugate functions to solve the torsion problem for shafts with sections bounded by confocal conics. The study includes sections that are general enough to encompass many of the cross-sections that Saint-Venant has worked out, such as rectangles and sectors of circles. The author also examines the position of the points of maximum strain and stress, and the changes in stresses for different sections.
