tldr: This study compares numerical and experimental results of oblique shock-wave reflections, demonstrating that numerical analysis of perfect inviscid compressible flow can now be placed on an equal footing with experimental methods. The research focuses on the interaction of shock waves with complex phenomena such as boundary layers, slipstreams, and non-equilibrium flow states. The findings provide a benchmark for validating computer codes and understanding the behavior of shock waves in various applications.
