tldr: The author presents a formal solution for the reflection of a spherical acoustic pulse by an infinite plane interface with an impedance that depends on frequency and angle of incidence. The study focuses on the behavior of the reflected pulse and the scattered wave, with potential applications in the reflection of blast waves, transient radiation by an electric dipole, and the propagation of acoustic pulses in rooms.
