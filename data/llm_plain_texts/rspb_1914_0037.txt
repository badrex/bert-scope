  - Tsetse flies
  - Nyasaland trypanosome
tldr: The authors studied the effects of the Zululand strain of Trypanosoma brucei on various animals, such as dogs, rabbits, monkeys, and goats. They found that the pathogenic action of this strain is similar to the trypanosome causing disease in man in Nyasaland, suggesting that the two trypanosomes are identical. The study also highlights the challenges in breeding and hatching tsetse flies for research purposes.
