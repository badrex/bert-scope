tldr: The authors studied the shapes and distribution of sensory and motor neurones in leech ganglia using intracellular injection of horseradish peroxidase. They discovered that sensory neurones have distinct branching patterns and receive inputs at specific regions, while motor neurones have spines that make synaptic contact with other cells. This research provides insights into the anatomical organization of the leech nervous system and its physiological activity.
