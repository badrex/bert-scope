tldr: This study focuses on lipid biomarkers as tracers of the biological carbon cycle in the North Atlantic. Biomarker concentrations and composition in water column particulates and bottom sediments show a strong correspondence to seasonal and interannual patterns of productivity. The research helps to unravel the processes that control the marine organic carbon cycle, providing valuable information for understanding the North Atlantic's biogeochemical and oceanographic systems.
