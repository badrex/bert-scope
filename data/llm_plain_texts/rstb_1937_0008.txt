tldr: The author studied the life history and culture methods of marine plankton diatoms, focusing on the Centricae group. They found that the cells grow in a longitudinal direction and eventually form auxospores to counteract the decrease of cell size. The author also discussed the culture methods used and observed the variability in diatom shapes within pure lines. This research contributes to our understanding of diatoms' importance as food in the sea and their role in marine biology.
