tldr: The author describes the Corpora lutea's role in forming ova and their connection to impregnation. Corpora lutea exist independently of sexual intercourse and are responsible for forming ova. After fulfilling their function, they are destroyed by absorption, regardless of whether the ova are impregnated or not. Impregnation likely occurs in the ovarium itself.
