tldr: The article is a biographical memoir of Sir Frederick William George White, a prominent figure in Australian science during and after World War II. White made significant contributions to the fields of wireless wave propagation, ionospheric reflections, and geophysics. He worked with J.A. Ratcliffe at the Cavendish Laboratory and later became a professor at King's College, London, where he studied diurnal variations in the amplitude of ionospheric reflections. White's work had a profound impact on the advancement of Australian science and the professional lives of the scientists involved.
