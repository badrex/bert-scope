tldr: The authors investigate the development of stereoscopic mechanisms in the visual cortex of cats, focusing on how neural systems develop and adapt during early visual experience. They found that binocularly driven neurons in kittens become modified in their synaptic organization, enhancing the specificity of binocular interaction and ensuring that the ranges of positional and orientational disparities match the actual stimulation encountered by the animal. This process is crucial for the development of stereopsis and understanding how the visual cortex analyzes retinal disparity.
