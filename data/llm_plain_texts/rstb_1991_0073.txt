revised_title: Herbivory and Plant Modularity: The Influence of Grazing on Plant Evolution
semantic_tags:
  - Plant-herbivore interactions

  - Plant physiology
  - Modular organisms
tldr: This article explores the influence of herbivory on the evolution, morphology, and physiology of plants as modular organisms. It discusses how the modular structure of plants allows for flexibility in response to herbivory and how herbivory can function as an evolutionary force modifying plant structure and function. The author presents a verbal model, the modular interaction model, to describe plant modular structure and functioning in relation to herbivory.
