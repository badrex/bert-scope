tldr: This article discusses the complexities of the meiotic process and chromosome synapsis, focusing on the mechanisms that govern homologous pairing and the impact of polyploidy on meiosis duration. The author highlights the importance of understanding these processes for the successful evolution of allopolyploids and the regulation of chromosome matching. The article also challenges the assumption that synapsis is a precondition for crossing over and proposes alternative models for the relationship between synapsis and crossover events.
