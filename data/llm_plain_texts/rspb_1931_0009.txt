tldr: This study investigates the pupillary mechanism and light reflex in the teleostean fish, Uranoscopus scaber. The research shows that the regulation of the pupil size is a nervous function, and not due to the direct incidence of light on the pigmented sphincter muscles. The findings also demonstrate that light entering one eye can cause narrowing of the opposite pupil, even in cases with a complete decussation of the optic nerve fibers. The study concludes that the regulation of the pupil size in fish, as in other vertebrates, is a nervous function.
