tldr: The article presents an approximate analytical solution for a growing steady-state mode III crack in an elastic perfectly plastic solid using an electrical analogy. The analysis utilizes the motion of non-redundant infinitesimal screw dislocations to calculate plastic strain and checks the analysis using dislocation crack tip shielding. The solution differs from previous solutions but contains key features of those solutions.
