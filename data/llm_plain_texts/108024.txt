tldr: Leonard Horner discovered an artificial substance resembling shells in a cotton factory's bleaching machinery. The substance was formed by a deposit of calcareous matter and gelatine, similar to the materials used by molluscs in shell formation. The substance exhibits properties such as iridescence, heat sensitivity, and solubility in muriatic acid, making it an interesting material for further study.
