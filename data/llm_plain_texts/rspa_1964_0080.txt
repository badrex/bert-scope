tldr: This study investigates the pyrolysis of diethyl ether inhibited by nitric oxide, finding that the reaction has a first-order molecular component and a three-halves-order free-radical component. The authors propose a chain mechanism involving nitric oxide in both initiation and termination, leading to a rate expression showing both first-order and three-halves-order dependence on ether pressure.
