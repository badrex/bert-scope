tldr: The authors conducted a detailed study of the annual cycle of temperature, algal cell numbers, and selected chemical variables in the North Basin of Windermere in 1947. They focused on the water column near the deepest point and found that phytoplankton growth was largely confined to the epilimnion, with diatom Asterionella being the dominant member. The study also explored the relationships between the biological situation and the physicochemical environment, including fluctuations in dissolved and total silica, oxygen consumption, alkalinity, and nitrate concentration.
