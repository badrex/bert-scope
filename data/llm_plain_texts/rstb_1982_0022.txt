tldr: This study investigates the nitrogen cycle in eutrophic freshwaters, focusing on the impact of agricultural and urban inputs. The authors found that increased use of chemical fertilizers and urban discharges are major causes of rising nitrate concentrations in freshwater ecosystems. They present data on nutrient inputs and the processes of the nitrogen cycle in two study areas in the UK, highlighting the importance of understanding these processes for water management and maintaining water quality.
