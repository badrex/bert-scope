tldr: This article discusses the early development of Cavia and the presence of placental remnants in the uterus. The author observed that these remnants can be found in the same uterus as normal embryos, which necessitates careful distinction between the two. The remnants are most frequent on the mesometric side of the uterus, where the placenta was attached, but can also be found lower down in the ante-mesometrium.
