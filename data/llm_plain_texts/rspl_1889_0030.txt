tldr: The authors, William Huggins and Mrs. Huggins, conducted photographic experiments on the spectra of Uranus and Saturn to determine if they shine by emitted or reflected light. They found that the spectra of both planets, from a little above F to beyond N in the ultra-violet, are due to reflected solar light, as they show all the chief Fraunhofer lines seen in the comparison spectra.
