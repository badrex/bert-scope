tldr: The authors analyzed the electrode potential distribution within a growing stress corrosion crack, which occurs when a material breaks down due to a combination of tensile stress and a corrosive environment. They found that the electrode potential within the crack is always less than the bulk equilibrium corrosion potential, leading to a reduced 'bare surface' dissolution current density. This research helps to better understand stress corrosion crack growth and improve the prediction of crack growth rates in materials.
