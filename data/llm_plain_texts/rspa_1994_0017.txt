tldr: This article presents a general numerical model for the diffusion and swelling of polymers, focusing on ultra-high molecular mass polyethylene. The model incorporates both Fickian and generalized Fickian diffusion, as well as the viscoelastic response of the polymer. The study demonstrates how this model can predict a broad range of swelling behaviors and diffusion profiles, depending on various parameters.
