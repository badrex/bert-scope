tldr: The author conducted extensive research on the veined structure of glaciers, examining various glaciers in the Alps. They observed that the veined structure, characterized by blue veins and a laminated appearance, is prevalent in vast portions of glaciers. The author discusses different theories for the origin of these veins, ultimately arguing that the veined structure corresponds to the pressure theory rather than stratification. The study also includes observations on air-bubbles, dirt-bands, and the problem of glacier motion.
