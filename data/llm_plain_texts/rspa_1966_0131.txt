  - Magnetic Properties
  - Temperature Dependence
  - Spectra Analysis
tldr: This article investigates spin wave resonance in iron films, examining their magnetic properties and the behavior of the spin wave coupling constant as a function of temperature. The authors discuss the observed spectra, comparing it to the itinerant electron model and the localized nature of the electrons in iron group ferromagnetic metals.
