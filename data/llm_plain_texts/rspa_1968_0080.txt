tldr: The authors present a theoretical technique for evaluating the time-dependent effects of general electrodynamic drifts in the F2 layer of the ionosphere. They develop a method to solve the full global diffusion equation, including electrodynamic drift, and apply it to a simple model atmosphere. The results confirm electrodynamic lifting as a significant factor controlling the dip equatorial layer and the associated ionization trough.
