  - Wave Equations
tldr: The author explores the magnetic moment of the electron using wave equations and shows how electromagnetic fields can be attributed to the convection of electricity and intrinsic magnetization. The formulae are generalized for high speeds, revealing electric and magnetic moments, and comparing the electron to a light-wave.
