tldr: The author conducted a study on the temperature classification of stars by comparing the spectra of various star types. They found that stars on the same temperature horizon have similar temperatures and absorption conditions, and observed differences in the spectra of stars on opposite sides of the temperature curve. This research helped refine the understanding of star properties and their classification.
