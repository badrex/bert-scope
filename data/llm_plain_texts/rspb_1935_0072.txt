revised_title: 'The Relationship between Methaemoglobin Formation and Oxygen Partial Pressure'

tldr: The author studied the oxidation of haemoglobin to methaemoglobin by oxygen and found that the rate of oxidation is maximal at a small partial pressure of oxygen. This discovery helps explain the effect of oxygen pressure on the rate of oxidation and provides insights into the relationship between methaemoglobin formation and oxygen partial pressure.
