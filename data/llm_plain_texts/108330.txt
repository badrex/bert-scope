tldr: The author, Francis Sibson, conducted extensive research on the respiratory system in various animals, focusing on the mechanics of respiration and the role of different muscles. The study included dissections and observations of live animals, as well as examining the respiratory apparatus in dead animals. The author discovered that the respiratory muscles and their functions are more complex than previously thought, and that different muscles act during inspiration and expiration. The research also provided insights into the respiratory system of snakes and the role of their ribs in respiration and locomotion.
