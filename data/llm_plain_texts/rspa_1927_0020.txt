tldr: The authors conducted a series of experiments to study the absorption spectra of nitrates in the 300 region. They investigated the effects of varying the positive ion, concentration, and solvent on the absorption curves. The results indicate that the nitrate ion or group has a standard band that extends from 270 to 330 nanometers with a maximum at 300 nanometers. The study also shows that Beer's law is not valid in its simple form for nitrate solutions, and that increasing concentration can bring about changes in the absorption curves due to the superposition of new absorption bands.
