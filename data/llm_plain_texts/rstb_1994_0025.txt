tldr: The authors develop a dynamic theory of Darwinian evolution in ecosystems, focusing on the stability of general attractors and the invasion exponent, which characterizes the evolutionary stability of an attractor to small mutant populations. They also introduce the concept of differential selective pressure and analyze the dynamics of phenotype distributions in populations. This theory applies to a broad class of biological and other dynamical systems, including chaotic and complex situations.
