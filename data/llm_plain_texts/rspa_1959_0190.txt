tldr: This study investigates the formation and growth of submarine sand-waves and tidal lee-waves in the ocean. The authors analyze the stability of these waves under deep, slow, and steady water flow, considering vertical variations in density and shear. They propose that stationary wave trains in the lee of obstacles and density gradients play a significant role in the growth of these waves. The findings are applied to a specific case study of sand-waves on La Chapelle Bank, providing insights into the mechanisms behind their formation and growth.
