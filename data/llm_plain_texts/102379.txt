tldr: The author explains the error caused by comparing surveys taken at different times due to the variation of the magnetic needle. He demonstrates the importance of accounting for this variation to avoid disputes between landowners. The author suggests that surveyors should use the true meridian for accurate mapmaking and that the variation should be considered when comparing old and new surveys.
