tldr: This article presents experiments conducted to determine the specific heats of metals and their relation to atomic weight. The author determined the specific heats of various elements and compounds over a range of temperatures and found that Neumann's law is approximately true at all temperatures. The results support the view that specific heat is determined by the nature of the atoms composing the molecules and is not a measure of the thermal work done.
