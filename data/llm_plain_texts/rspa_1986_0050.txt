tldr: This article investigates the effects of a steadily increasing ambient temperature on thermal explosions and times to ignition in systems with distributed temperatures. The authors develop a mathematical model to analyze the influence of external heating and cooling on the critical values for the Frank-Kamenetskii parameter and the ignition times for various geometries, such as spheres, cylinders, and slabs. The study provides insights into the behavior of exothermic reactions under different conditions and helps improve the understanding of thermal safety in industrial processes.
