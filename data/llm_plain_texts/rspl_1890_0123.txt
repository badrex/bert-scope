tldr: The author investigates the electrodynamics of non-circuital currents and dielectric polarization, expanding on Maxwell's theory. They explore the equations of the field and the propagation of electrical action in continuous media, considering the role of non-circuital currents and the function of dielectric polarization in the context of electrodynamics.
