tldr: The author describes two new vanadium minerals, Boscoelite and Mottramite, found in various locations. They provide detailed descriptions of the minerals' physical properties, behaviors under the blowpipe, and chemical compositions. The minerals are of interest due to their isomorphous group with other phosphates, arsenates, and vanadates.
