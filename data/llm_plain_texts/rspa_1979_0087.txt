tldr: The article presents a reduction of the problem of differentially rotating charged dust in general relativity to a single equation, which becomes determinate once an arbitrary function of one variable is specified. This approach simplifies the system of equations, making it easier to analyze and potentially find new solutions for rotating charged dust in the context of general relativity.
