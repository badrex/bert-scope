revised_title: 'Low Temperature Effects on Supersaturated Glauber Salt Solutions'
semantic_tags:
  - Supersaturated solutions
  - Glauber's salt
  - Hydrates
  - Low temperatures
  - Crystal formation
tldr: The author studied the effects of low temperatures on supersaturated solutions of Glauber's salt. They discovered the formation of two new hydrates and observed the unique crystal formations and temperature changes that occurred during the cooling process. This research expanded the understanding of supersaturated solutions and their behavior under various conditions.
