tldr: This study investigates the adhesion between solid surfaces and the effects of surface films and humidity. It shows that adhesion is negligible between clean, hard surfaces in dry air but increases in the presence of moisture due to the surface tension of adsorbed water. The research also demonstrates that certain surface films, such as lubricants, reduce adhesion and friction between surfaces.
