tldr: 'John F. W. Herschel observed nebulae and star clusters using a twenty-feet reflector at Slough between 1825 and 1833. He encountered various difficulties in observing these celestial objects due to their faintness and the challenges of the atmosphere. He noticed a peculiar atmospheric phenomenon that could be connected to the aurora borealis. Herschel also discussed the possibility of minute stars being part of planetary systems within nebulae.'
