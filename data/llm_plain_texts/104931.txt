tldr: Richard Brocklesby conducted experiments on animals to study the sensibility and irritability of their various parts. He found that only nerves were sensitive, while some parts were irritable without much sensibility. He also discovered that certain substances, like diluted spirit of vitriol, could cause pain and contractions in animal tissues. These findings supported the conclusions of other scientists like Drs. Haller, Castle, and Zimmerman.
