tldr: This article explores the Faraday effect in ferromagnetics using a simple model. The authors explain the origin of the enormous negative rotation in thin films of ferromagnetics and how it is proportional to the magnetization. They consider a single crystal of the metal and use the Heisenberg model to explain the phenomenon, providing a rough estimate of the rotation and its variation with the intensity of magnetization.
