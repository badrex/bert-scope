tldr: 'The authors analyze the transient decomposition-recombination dynamics of dissociating and ionizing gases using high activation energy asymptotic analysis. They describe the process in three distinct phases: initiation, major dissociation, and final relaxation. The study provides timescales for each phase and compares the analytical solution with numerical and experimental results.'
