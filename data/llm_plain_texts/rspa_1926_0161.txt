tldr: The author investigates the structure of the secondary hydrogen spectrum and identifies various band systems associated with Fulcher's bands. They propose a Rydberg-Ritz formula to connect the null lines of these band systems and explain the observed effects in terms of electron jumps and vibration jumps. The study provides a detailed analysis of the bands, their properties, and the relationships between them, contributing to a better understanding of atomic spectroscopy and quantum mechanics.
