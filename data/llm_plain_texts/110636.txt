tldr: The author conducted extensive research on the early stages of mammalian ovum development, focusing on the rabbit. They observed and documented various changes in the ovum during its journey through the female reproductive system, challenging some of the prevailing theories in embryology. The findings provide valuable insights into the development of mammals and may explain similar observations made in other animals.
