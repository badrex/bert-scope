tldr: This article investigates the electromotive properties of the skin in eels, specifically the current of rest and its relation to glandular processes. The author finds that the skin's E.M.F. undergoes excitatory variations due to electrical, thermic, and mechanical stimulation, supporting the hypothesis that both the E.M.F. of the current of rest and that of the current of action originate from a glandular source.
