tldr: The author, Henry James Brooke, discusses the geometrical isomorphism of crystals and introduces a new crystallographic notation system. He explains the six crystal systems, their elementary solids, and the angles between faces. The new notation system helps in denoting and distinguishing secondary faces based on the proportions they cut away from primary edges. This paper presents crystallography under a new aspect, offering unexpected results and a better understanding of crystal structures.
