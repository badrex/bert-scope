tldr: This article presents a case study of a rare skin condition where the cuticle separates from the skin, forming gloves-like structures on the hands and feet. The patient, Mr. William Wright, experiences recurring fevers and itching, leading to the cuticle's separation and eventual shedding of nails. The author, Mr. B. Gooch, shares this unique case with Mr. Joseph Warner, F.R.S., seeking their thoughts on this extraordinary phenomenon.
