tldr: This study investigates the possibility of regenerating mechanosensory nerves in salamanders having a preference for specific skin regions or populations of Merkel cells. The results show that regenerating and intact mechanosensory nerves do not have a preference for particular skin regions or Merkel cells. The nerves that arrive first at denervated skin establish a permanent association with the Merkel cells, preventing other axons from establishing a similar functional innervation.
