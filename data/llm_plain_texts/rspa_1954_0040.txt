tldr: The authors used radioactive carbon-14 labeled vinyl acetate to study the kinetics of the transfer to polymer process and self-branching in the polymerization of vinyl acetate. They found that the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from a dead polymer molecule by a polyvinylacetate radical occurs at a rate similar to that with which the radical abstracts a hydrogen atom from a small molecule. This research provides valuable information about the kinetics of transfer to polymer and the structure of branched polymers.
