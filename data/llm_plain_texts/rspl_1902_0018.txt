tldr: This article explores the similarities between the effects of electromagnetic radiation and mechanical strains on materials. The author demonstrates that both radiation and mechanical disturbances can cause conductivity and electromotive variations in substances. The study reveals that the responses to these stimuli are remarkably similar, suggesting a common molecular effect. The author also investigates the effects of varying stimulus intensity, duration, and type, comparing the response-curves of mechanical and radiation stimuli.
