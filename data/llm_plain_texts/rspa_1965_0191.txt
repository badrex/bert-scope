tldr: The author investigates the phase-change hypothesis of the Earth's structure, suggesting that the liquid core represents a phase-change at high pressure of the mantle material. Accurate machine-integrations and new series of three-zone models are used to refine calculations and better understand the Earth's internal mass distribution. The author also discusses the importance of considering the Earth's internal properties, which cannot be assumed to be the same as material at low pressures.
