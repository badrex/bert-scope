tldr: The authors conducted experiments on thermal diffusion in mixtures containing carbon dioxide to study the forces operating during intermolecular collisions. They found a sharp change in the value of the thermal diffusion coefficient at a specific temperature, suggesting a change in the nature of the forces involved. This led to a focus on understanding the behavior of carbon dioxide mixtures and the underlying intermolecular forces.
