tldr: This article discusses the results of lunar gravity determinations obtained from radio tracking data of Apollo spacecraft and subsatellites. The analysis reveals the presence of large positive gravity anomalies over circular maria basins, known as mascons, and negative anomalies in large impact craters. The findings suggest a relatively rigid surface layer on the Moon and provide insights into the Moon's crust, its formation, and its plasticity during different eras.
