tldr: The article discusses the implications of identifying a DNA restriction fragment length polymorphism closely linked to Huntington's disease on the short arm of chromosome 4. This allows for presymptomatic prediction in first-degree relatives at risk, aiding in genetic counseling. However, there are serious ethical reservations concerning predictive tests in the absence of effective therapy. The author examines the situation in a stable population in south Wales, where a genetic register for Huntington's disease has been developed, and discusses the implications of these new developments for prevention and prediction.
