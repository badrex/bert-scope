tldr: The authors develop a generalized theory of transformation strains in lattices, incorporating deformation twinning and martensite crystallography. They analyze transformation strains in two different lattices, considering various deformation processes and their combinations. The study examines six special cases of practical interest, including deformation twinning, martensite crystallography, and double deformation mechanisms.
