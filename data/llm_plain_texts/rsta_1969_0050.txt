tldr: This article discusses the properties of factors involved in the conventional formula for maximum hourly mean ground level concentration, focusing on wind speed and source strength. The analysis indicates that an upper bound exists for these factors, which is 20% above the classical result for the uniform unbounded atmosphere. The study also considers the effects of stable layers on the upper bound and provides practical implications for air pollution control.
