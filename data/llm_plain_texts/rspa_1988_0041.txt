tldr: This article examines two isothermal kinetic schemes, the quadratic autocatalytic scheme with complex termination and Yang's model for the oxidation of carbon monoxide. The authors use a recently developed qualitative technique to analyze the behavior of these systems over their entire parameter space, finding various phase portraits and bifurcation diagrams. The study provides a comprehensive understanding of the complex phenomena observed in isothermal chemical systems.
