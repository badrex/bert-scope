tldr: This article discusses the impact of air refraction on astronomical observations and provides a method to correct for it. Dr. Halley explains that the apparent position of celestial objects is affected by the refraction of light as it passes through the Earth's atmosphere. He presents a table to help astronomers calculate the necessary corrections for their observations, allowing for more accurate measurements of celestial distances and positions.
