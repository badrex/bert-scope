tldr: This article examines the evolution of the mammalian palate and the conflicting opinions on the homologies of the mammalian vomer. The authors reevaluate the evidence from embryology and paleontology, revisiting the parasphenoid-vomer hypothesis and the homologies of the mammalian pterygoids. They propose a new interpretation of the data, discussing the probable stages by which the mammalian palate was derived from reptilian predecessors and considering these changes from a functional perspective.
