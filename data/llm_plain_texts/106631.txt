tldr: Lieutenant William Paterson discovered a new species of electrical fish in the Comora Islands while on duty with the 98th Regiment. The fish, which seems to differ from previously known electrical fish, was found in coral rock cavities near the island. Upon touching the fish, Paterson and others experienced electrical shocks, confirming its electrical properties. The fish's unique characteristics and electrical organs make it an interesting subject for further study in natural history.
