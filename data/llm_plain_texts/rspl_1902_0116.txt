tldr: The author, Sir William Crookes, discovered that a solution of radium nitrate emits emanations that cause a screen to glow with a green light. These emanations create scintillations, which are flashes of light that appear on the screen. The scintillations are affected by the proximity of the radium and the type of screen used. The author also found that the emanations can be absorbed by certain materials, such as bismuth and platinum, which then become radioactive.
