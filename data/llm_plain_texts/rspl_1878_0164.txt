tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the effect of sugar on blood sugar levels and putrefaction. They found that sugar levels in the blood decrease rapidly in the first few days after withdrawal and then remain nearly constant. The author also discovered that there is another reducing substance in the blood that is not affected by putrefaction, which may influence blood sugar measurements.
