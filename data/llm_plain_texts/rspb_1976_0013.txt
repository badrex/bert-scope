tldr: The ommatidium of the lacewing insect, Chrysopa, has a complex structure with three types of rhabdomeres that allow the eye to adapt to different light conditions. In the light-adapted state, light enters the ommatidium through a crystalline tract surrounded by pigment grains. In the dark-adapted state, the retinula cell nuclei and distal rhabdomere move to the cone tip, and the crystalline tract is drawn into the cone. This structure allows the lacewing to have a wide visual field and improve the signal-to-noise ratio in its neural mechanisms.
