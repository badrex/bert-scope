tldr: This article presents a new method to measure the thermal conductivity of air by eliminating convection currents. The authors use a unique experimental setup with two horizontal copper discs and a guard ring to ensure that heat transfer occurs only through conduction and radiation. They find that the thermal conductivity of air is independent of pressure and varies slightly with temperature.
