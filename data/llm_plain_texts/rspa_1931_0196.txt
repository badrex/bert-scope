tldr: The authors extend the quantum theory of conduction to include the effect of impurities in electronic semi-conductors. They explain how impurities dominate the electrical properties of semi-conductors and provide a qualitative view of their effect. The paper also discusses the distribution of electrons between various energy levels and the modification of the temperature dependence of conductivity due to impurities.
