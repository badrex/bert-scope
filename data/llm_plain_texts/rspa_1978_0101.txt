tldr: This article challenges the concept of compressive strength in brittle materials and proposes a new approach based on the energy criterion of cracking. The author suggests that fracture surface energy, not compressive strength, is the fundamental material property dictating compression cracking. The article provides a detailed theoretical and experimental investigation of compression splitting in glassy materials, explaining how factors such as geometry, specimen size, and lateral forces affect the failure mode.
