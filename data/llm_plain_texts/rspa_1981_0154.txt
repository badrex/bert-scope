tldr: The authors conducted an experimental study of mercury condensation to improve the understanding of interphase matter transfer. They measured condensation rate, vapor and condenser surface temperatures, and used thermocouples to determine the temperature of the copper-nickel interface. The results support recent theoretical studies and indicate that the condensation coefficient exceeds 0.9. The study enhances the accuracy of measurements and provides valuable data for further research in interphase matter transfer.
