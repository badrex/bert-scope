tldr: The author, Professor L. Becker, observed the solar eclipse at Kalaa-es-Senam, Tunis, using two cameras and a series of correctly-timed photographs. The main goal was to determine the law according to which the light of the corona decreases with distance from the sun. The author designed mechanisms to automatically make exposures on one plate, and despite some damage to the apparatus during the journey, successful observations were made. The photographs captured the corona and provided valuable data for further analysis.
