tldr: The authors conducted experiments using the Cartesian diver ultramicromanometer to study the anaerobic glycolysis of different regions in the amphibian gastrula. They found that the dorsal lip of the gastrula had a higher rate of glycolysis and oxygen consumption compared to the ventral ectoderm, suggesting a connection between carbohydrate metabolism and organizer action in morphogenesis.
