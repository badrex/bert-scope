tldr: The author, John Thomas Graves, attempts to rectify inaccuracies in logarithmic formulae, focusing on the development of f0 and f-1 0. He provides a new method for developing y and x in terms of a and proposes a solution for the case when a is negative or impossible. This work contributes to the understanding of exponential theory and offers a more complete set of logarithmic formulae.
