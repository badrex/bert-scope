tldr: The article investigates the efficiency of emission of fluorescent radiation from xenon and krypton using an expansion chamber. It then explores a theory of electro-kinetic effects in solution, focusing on reactions between ions and polar molecules. The author provides a mathematical analysis of the factors involved in these reactions, including the velocity coefficient, and discusses the implications of their findings for understanding chemical reactions and the role of electrostatic interactions.
