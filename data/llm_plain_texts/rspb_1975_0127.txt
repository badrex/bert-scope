tldr: The authors discovered that increasing potassium ion concentration in the perfusion fluid of an isolated ox adrenal gland leads to the release of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) into the perfusate. The enzyme activity released is mainly AChE-5, which is identical to the soluble isoenzyme present in splanchnic nerve trunks and one of the five soluble isoenzymes in the adrenal medulla. The study demonstrates that the adrenal medulla can secrete AChE.
