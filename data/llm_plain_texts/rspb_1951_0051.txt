tldr: Researchers conducted electrical stimulation experiments on the medulla oblongata of sheep to localize respiratory regions. They discovered two distinct regions: an inspiratory region and an expiratory region, both within the reticular formation of the medulla oblongata. The study provides insights into the central nervous control of the respiratory act in ruminants.
