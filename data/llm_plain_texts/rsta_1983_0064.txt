tldr: This article discusses the relationship between the microstructure and chemistry of unhydrated cements, focusing on how factors such as clinker composition, burning temperature, and manufacturing processes affect cement quality. The authors explain how understanding these factors can help develop cements with specific properties and improve the overall performance of hydraulic cements.
