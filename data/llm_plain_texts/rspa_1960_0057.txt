tldr: The authors present a rapidly convergent procedure for solving the equations of subsonic potential flow, focusing on analytic solutions. They discuss various approximations and their accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of the method for two-dimensional bodies with low Mach numbers. The method can also be applied to three-dimensional bodies that are nearly axisymmetric.
