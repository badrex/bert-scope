tldr: This article presents the results of experiments conducted on the thermal expansion of pure nickel and cobalt. The authors determined the coefficients of linear expansion for both metals and compared their findings with previous research by Fizeau. The results show that the expansion coefficients for both nickel and cobalt increase with temperature, and the difference between the two metals' expansion rates also increases with temperature.
