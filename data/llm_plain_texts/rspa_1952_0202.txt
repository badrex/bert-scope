revised_title: Quantum Field Theory of Bound States: Weak Interaction Approximation
semantic_tags:
  - Quantum Field Theory
  - Weak Interaction
  - Bound States
  - Electrodynamics
  - Renormalization Theory
tldr: This article explores the mathematical theory of bound states in weak interaction using quantum field theory. It discusses the separation of interaction Hamiltonian into partial interactions and the modified interaction representation. The article also investigates the propagators for compound particles and their singularities, as well as the relativistic analogue of Dirac's theory of spontaneous emission.
