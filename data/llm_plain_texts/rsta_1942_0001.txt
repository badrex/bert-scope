tldr: The author provides a geometrical interpretation of classical matrix theory by using a systematic approach to higher dimensions. They introduce the concept of medial spaces and reflexion processes to explain the behavior of matrices and matrix pencils. The study covers topics such as latent roots, elementary divisors, and minimal indices, offering a new perspective on matrix theory.
