tldr: This article investigates the specific heat and other physical properties of mixtures of methylic alcohol and water. The authors found that certain properties, such as specific heat and heat evolved during mixing, reach a maximum deviation from the mean in mixtures of the same strength. The relationship between these properties is complex and likely interconnected, suggesting a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms is needed.
