tldr: This article discusses the international control of blackflies, the vectors of river blindness, caused by Onchocerca volvulus. The authors describe the Onchocerciasis Control Programme (OCP) of the World Health Organization (WHO), which uses insecticides and anti-helminthics to combat the disease. They also address the threat of reinvasions of blackflies from neighboring territories into the OCP area and the discovery of the blackflies' long-distance migration abilities.
