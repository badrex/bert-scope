tldr: This article explores the stability of superspheres, which are compact, three-dimensional spherical clumps of colloidal crystalites. The stability is explained by the existence of two opposing forces within the superspheres: long-range electrostatic repulsion and short-range attractive dispersion forces. The author provides a condition of stability that agrees with experimental observations and discusses the generality of the phenomenon. The study also applies the theory to diffusion-limited aggregates, which have a fractal dimension.
