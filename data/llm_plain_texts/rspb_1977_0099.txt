tldr: The study investigates the effects of lesions in the suprachiasmatic nuclei on female rats, leading to endocrine and behavioral abnormalities. These abnormalities include disrupted diurnal rhythms, altered adrenal and pineal activity, and changes in voluntary wheel-running activity, water, and food intake patterns. The results suggest that the suprachiasmatic nuclei play a crucial role in regulating various physiological processes influenced by the light-dark cycle.
