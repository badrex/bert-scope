tldr: The article investigates boundary layer interactions and upstream influence in supersonic flows without separation. It extends the author's method of perturbing a parallel flow and introduces a new boundary condition to analyze the behavior of each harmonic component outside the inner viscous sublayer. The study provides solutions for large and small disturbances, deducing the principal local features of wall-pressure distribution and flow outside the boundary layer, as well as the extent of upstream influence. The findings have implications for understanding the flow upstream of separation in interactions with laminar separation.
