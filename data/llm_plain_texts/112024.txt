tldr: The author, James Hicks, describes an improved mercurial barometer design with a unique graduation method. The barometer features a glass tube with a larger bore in the lower half, allowing for better compensation and a more accurate scale. The new design also incorporates a vernier for precise readings and Gay-Lussac's pipette to prevent air contamination. This innovation provides a more reliable and user-friendly barometer for measuring atmospheric pressure.
