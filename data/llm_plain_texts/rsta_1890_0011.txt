tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the ratio of the electromagnetic unit of electricity to the electrostatic unit. They used a condenser with two co-axial cylinders and a guard ring to measure the capacity in both electrostatic and electromagnetic measures. The results showed that the electromagnetic measure of the capacity was less than previous values, leading to a better understanding of the relationship between the two units.
