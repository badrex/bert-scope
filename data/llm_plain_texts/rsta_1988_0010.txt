tldr: The article presents a review of high-resolution autodetachment spectroscopy of negative ions, focusing on the coaxial laser-ion-beam technique used to study autodetachment dynamics in molecular negative ions. The authors discuss various autodetachment mechanisms and their implications, as well as the experimental methods and apparatus used in their research. The study provides insights into the structural characteristics of negative ions and the interactions between rotating-vibrating dipoles and detached electrons.
