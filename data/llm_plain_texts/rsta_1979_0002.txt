tldr: This article presents a study of the 5p excitation in atomic barium, focusing on the absorption spectra of Ba1 and Cs1. The authors analyze the complex structure of the spectra and compare their findings with other related elements. They use synchrotron radiation and other experimental techniques to observe and interpret the results, providing insights into the behavior of atomic structures and transitions.
