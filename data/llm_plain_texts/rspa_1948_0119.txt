tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the nuclear spectra of thorium B and C, focusing on gamma-ray transitions. They measured the intensities of several gamma-ray lines and analyzed the shapes of the spectra. Their findings provide insights into the nuclear decay processes of thorium isotopes and contribute to the understanding of nuclear physics.
