tldr: The authors study the secondary flow created when a straight pipe filled with a viscous fluid is rotated. They find that the fluid particles move in spirals along the pipe, similar to the motion in a stationary curved pipe. The research also provides an expression for the increase in resistance to the flow due to this secondary motion.
