tldr: The authors conducted a study on the effects of hypophysectomy on the growth and skeletal development of ferrets. They found that after the removal of the pituitary gland, the growth rate in both male and female ferrets was greatly reduced. The skeletal development was also affected, with bones showing stasis in growth and a general arrest of ossification. This research highlights the importance of the pituitary gland in controlling growth and skeletal development in mammals.
