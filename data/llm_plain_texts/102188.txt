tldr: The author presents methods for solving three problems related to finding distances and positions of objects at sea or surveying coastlines using triangulation. These methods can also be applied to creating accurate maps of a country by measuring the angles and distances between points. The solutions involve constructing triangles and using trigonometry to find the required distances and positions.
