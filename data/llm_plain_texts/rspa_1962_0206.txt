tldr: This article examines gravitational fields containing bounded sources and gravitational radiation by analyzing their properties at spatial infinity. The author presents a method for integrating the field equations and analyzes the asymptotic behavior of the metric and Riemann tensors for large spatial distances. The study reveals that gravitational waves appear to carry mass away from the interior and suggests a superposition principle for the radiation modes of the gravitational field.
