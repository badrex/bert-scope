tldr: The article investigates the non-linear torsional oscillation of a two-degree-of-freedom system incorporating a Hooke joint. The analysis uses a variant of Kryloff and Bogoliuboff's method and shows that each mode of the system can perform oscillations of large amplitude in critical speed ranges. Hysteresis effects and discontinuous jumps in amplitude are expected in these speed ranges when damping is light.
