tldr: 'The article discusses the diagnosis and analysis of chaotic dynamical systems with fluctuating parameters. It explains how some tools used for understanding chaotic dynamics can still be applied in this situation and introduces the concept of a family of attractors depending on fluctuating parameters. The article also explores the determination of higher characteristic exponents and short-term predictions for the time evolution of these systems.'
