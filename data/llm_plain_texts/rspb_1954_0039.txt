tldr: The authors conducted experiments on rat diaphragm muscles to measure the sodium and potassium fluxes using radioactive tracers. They found that the potassium content reached a steady state and remained constant for several hours, allowing for the measurement of ion fluxes and the analysis of cellular processes in the muscle tissue.
