tldr: The authors conducted experiments on cats to investigate the area of the brain responsible for cardiac irregularities under chloroform anesthesia. They discovered that the hypothalamus plays a crucial role in these irregularities and found evidence of nerve tracts connecting the hypothalamus with spinal sympathetic centers. This research provides insights into the complex relationship between the brain and the autonomic nervous system, particularly in the regulation of heart function.
