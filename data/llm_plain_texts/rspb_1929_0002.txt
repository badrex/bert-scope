tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the respiratory quotient of the excess metabolism during exercise. They discovered that the respiratory quotient is higher than unity during severe exercise, indicating that the body uses more oxygen and produces more carbon dioxide than during rest. This phenomenon helps explain the controversy surrounding the use of carbohydrates and other foodstuffs for energy during exercise. The authors emphasize the importance of strict experimental precautions and subject selection for accurate results.
