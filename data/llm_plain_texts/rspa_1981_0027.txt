tldr: The authors present a formal derivation of the general solution to a classical Boltzmann equation, which describes the evolution of a gas towards a Maxwellian equilibrium state. They construct a countable ensemble of particular solutions called pure solutions and combine them to form the general solution. The study focuses on the relaxation of non-equilibrium distribution functions to Maxwellian form and the formation of the high-energy tail of the velocity distribution.
