tldr: The author discusses the early predictions and history of hollow graphite molecules, also known as fullerenes, and their properties. The discovery of buckminsterfullerene in 1985 challenged some initial predictions about giant fullerenes and graphite nanotubes, but the idea of trapping smaller molecules inside these structures has been confirmed. The author also speculates on the potential properties of giant fullerenes, such as their volatility and interaction with other molecules.
