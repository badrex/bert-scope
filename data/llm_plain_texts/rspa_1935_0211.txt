  - Self-Consistent Field
tldr: The authors present a method to extend the self-consistent field theory to include both relativistic effects and exchange interactions in atomic systems. They derive the relativistic self-consistent field equations and demonstrate their application by deriving the equations for two types of wave functions for copper.
