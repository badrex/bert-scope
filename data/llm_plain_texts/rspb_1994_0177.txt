revised_title: 'Female Attraction to Central Males in Black Grouse Leks'

  - Animal behavior

  - Bird mating
  - Lekking behavior
tldr: 'This study examines the mating success of black grouse males in relation to their territory centrality and finds that females are more attracted to clustered males. Central males in black grouse leks achieve more copulations than peripheral males, and a choice experiment in an aviary supports the idea that females are attracted to densely clustered males. This preference for central males may explain the evolution of lekking behavior in black grouse species.'
