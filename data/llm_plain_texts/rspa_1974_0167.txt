tldr: This study investigates the adhesion between clean surfaces at light loads, focusing on the influence of factors such as surface topography, ductility, and adsorbed gas films. The research uses a crossed cylinder geometry to examine adhesion between metals, covalent and ionic solids, and the effect of adsorbed gas films on adhesion. The findings provide insights into the behavior of adhesive junctions and the role of surface energy and ductility in adhesion.
