tldr: This study presents a mathematical model that analyzes the transmission of HIV within heterosexual populations in Sub-Saharan Africa, considering age and sex dependency in rates of sexual partner change and sexual partner choice. The model suggests that AIDS can reverse population growth rates from positive to negative values over a few decades, highlighting the importance of understanding age-dependent sexual activity and contact patterns to predict the spread of the epidemic and its demographic impact.
