tldr: This study investigates a population of the snail Cepaea nemoralis over 23 years, focusing on its morph frequencies and population dynamics. The population experienced changes in habitat and size but maintained almost constant morph frequencies. The research suggests that variation in recruitment, rather than survival, is responsible for population fluctuations, and the lack of predators and changes in survival rates are consistent with invariant morph frequencies.
