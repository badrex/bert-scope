tldr: The authors isolated and sequenced two novel neuropeptides, SALMFamide 1 and SALMFamide 2, from the radial nerve cords of starfishes Asterias rubens and Asterias forbesi. These peptides belong to a new family of neuropeptides called SALMFamides and are the first to be identified in species belonging to the phylum Echinodermata. The discovery of these neuropeptides could provide insights into the control of locomotion and other physiological processes in echinoderms.
