tldr: The authors developed a model of sino-atrial node electrical activity based on a modification of the DiFrancesco-Noble equations. The model incorporates ion currents generated by the Na-K and Na-Ca exchange processes and reconstructs intracellular and extracellular ion concentration variations. The modified equations successfully reproduce action potential and pacemaker activity in the sino-atrial node, providing insights into the node's unique properties and potential mechanisms of overdrive suppression.
