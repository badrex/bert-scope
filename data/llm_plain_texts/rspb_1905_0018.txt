tldr: The author discovers two new species of Lagenostoma, a type of pteridospermous seed from the Coal Measures, and provides a detailed description of their morphology and structure. These findings contribute to the understanding of the habit of Lyginodendron and shed light on the phylogeny of the Cycads, a class of ancient Spermophytes that still have some surviving members today.
