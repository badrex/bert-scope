tldr: 'The article discusses the active site of the RuBP carboxylase enzyme, which plays a crucial role in photosynthesis. The authors identify two essential lysine residues in the enzyme and explore their functions. They also describe the use of affinity labeling to study the active site and its components, providing insights into the mechanism of RuBP carboxylase and its evolution.'
