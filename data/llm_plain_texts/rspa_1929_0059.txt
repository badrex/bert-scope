revised_title: 'Investigating Divergent Waves in Gravitational Theory'
semantic_tags:
  - Gravitational Waves

  - Einstein's Theory of General Relativity
  - Wave Propagation
tldr: The authors investigate the propagation of gravitational waves, specifically divergent waves, using Einstein's theory of general relativity. They focus on plane waves of small amplitude and provide a generalization of the solution for these waves. The study helps to understand the nature of waves at infinity and their physical reality.
