tldr: The authors developed a method to measure the blast pressures from various explosive charges and bombs using piezo-electric gauges and cathode-ray oscillographs. They found that the scale relationship of blast waves holds good over a wide range of charge weight, and the measured values of blast wave velocity and decay rates were in good agreement with theoretical calculations.
