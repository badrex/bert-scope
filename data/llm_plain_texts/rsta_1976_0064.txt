tldr: The authors propose a new criterion for determining the frictional conditions at the tool/chip interface in machining, using the average shear flow stress within the plastic zone adjacent to the tool/chip interface. This criterion is based on the concept of minimum work, which aims to minimize both the frictional and total work done in chip formation. The theory is applied to predict cutting forces and compared with experimental results, showing promising agreement.
