tldr: The authors develop a theory based on quasi-degenerate perturbation theory to study the effect of global-scale, steady-state convection and elastic-gravitational asphericities on helioseismic eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions. They present a formalism to apply this theory computationally and discuss its implications for understanding solar structure and dynamics.
