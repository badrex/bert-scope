tldr: This article documents weather observations and navigation details during a voyage to China in 1700. The author, James Cunningham, records temperature, barometric pressure, wind direction, and compass readings. He also notes the behavior of the dipping needle, which is used for determining the Earth's magnetic field. These observations provide valuable insights into the climate, weather patterns, and navigation techniques of the time.
