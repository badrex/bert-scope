tldr: This study investigates the survival of eggs in immature rat ovaries after freezing and thawing, and the effects of different freezing techniques. The researchers found that egg survival rates were generally low, with some improvements seen in certain freezing methods. The study aimed to improve freezing techniques to potentially be adapted for agricultural animals in the future.
