tldr: The authors present a method for detecting and exploiting symmetries in affine images to improve shape recognition and understanding. They demonstrate how local reflectional symmetries can be used for tasks such as image back-projection, slant and tilt determination, and coplanarity tests. This research contributes to the field of computer vision and shape representation.
