tldr: The author, Stephen Lee, discusses the impact of atmospheric dispersion on astronomical observations. He highlights the importance of considering different colored rays in corrections for mean refraction and suggests that this may explain discrepancies in observations of the solstices and between different observers. Lee also offers an explanation for the apparent projection of red stars like Aldebaran onto the moon's surface. He provides numerous observations on Mars, Venus, and fixed stars, inferring that the dispersion of light is between one sixtieth and one seventieth of the total atmospheric refraction. Lastly, he recommends precautions to improve the accuracy of atmospheric refraction measurements.
