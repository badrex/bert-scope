tldr: This article discusses the discovery and movement of a shallow subtropical subducting westward propagating eddy, known as Swesty. The eddy was observed to move across the eastern basin of the North Atlantic and was first detected by the movement and temperature of a drogued Argos buoy. The eddy's properties and kinematics were analyzed through hydrographic surveys and buoy movements, revealing important aspects of mixing and movement in the ocean.
