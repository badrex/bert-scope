tldr: This article analyzes the problem of partitioning the union of disks in plant competition models, focusing on the boundary curve between two disks. The authors prove that the partition is specified by a boundary curve with a very explicit form, which includes the Johnson-Mehl construction, the common chord, and the perimeter of the larger disk. The partition rules make severe restrictions on the three-dimensional crown shapes, leading to specific crown surface equations.
