tldr: This article reviews seasonal and diurnal variations of middle atmosphere winds observed from balloons, rockets, and satellites. It discusses the prevailing components, tidal motions, and gravity waves in upper atmosphere winds. The study combines rocket data with ground-based radio techniques to construct meridional cross-sections of mean W-E and S-N wind components at monthly intervals. The article also examines the impact of seasonal and longer-term effects on wind variations and the role of diurnal wind oscillations at heights between 25 and 60 km.
