tldr: This article describes the case of Grace Lowdell, a woman with a large tumour on her thigh. The tumour was examined by several physicians and surgeons, and eventually, it was decided to attempt its excision. The surgeon, John Chandler, used a ligature to constrict the tumour before removing it. The patient recovered well, and the tumour was successfully removed without any complications.
