semantic_tags:
  - Glycolysis
  - Phosphofructokinase
  - Enzyme kinetics
  - Allosteric regulation
  - Crystal structure
tldr: The article discusses the structure, activity, and evolution of phosphofructokinase, an enzyme that plays a key role in glycolysis. The author describes the crystal structure of the enzyme from Bacillus stearothermophilus and explains its allosteric regulation, including activation by ADP and inhibition by phosphoenolpyruvate. The enzyme's kinetics and its role in responding to the energy levels of the cell are also discussed.
