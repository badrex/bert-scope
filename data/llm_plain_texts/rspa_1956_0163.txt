tldr: The authors studied the changes in the absorption spectra of irradiated diamonds after heat treatment. They discovered that heating irradiated type I and type II diamonds at different temperatures led to various changes in the absorption spectra, which they attributed to the recombination of interstitials and vacancies, the formation of new defects, and the agglomeration of defects.
