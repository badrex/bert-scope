tldr: The author discusses the methods used in lunar theory and perturbation theory, comparing the methods of variation of constants and indeterminate coefficients. They argue for the importance of uniformity in methods and the need for independent verification of results. The author also demonstrates that certain coefficients in the development of the disturbing function equal zero, which has implications for the accuracy of lunar tables.
