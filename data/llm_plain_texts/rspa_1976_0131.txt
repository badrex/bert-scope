tldr: This article presents a mathematical analysis of the equilibrium and stability of two-dimensional pendent drops under the influence of gravity and surface tension forces. The authors calculate equilibrium profiles for drops hanging from horizontal apertures of varying widths and discuss the stability of these equilibria to different types of perturbations, including plane perturbations symmetric about the center plane and three-dimensional perturbations with sinuous variations along the drop's length.
