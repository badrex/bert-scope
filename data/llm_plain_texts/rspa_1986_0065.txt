tldr: This study evaluates the assumptions and criteria used in the analysis of oblique shock-wave reflections in pseudostationary flow. The authors examine the effects of internal degrees of freedom excitation, deviations from the assumption of a perpendicular Mach stem, and the agreement between experimental and numerical transition boundaries. The findings improve the understanding of shock-wave reflections and contribute to the development of more accurate analytical predictions.
