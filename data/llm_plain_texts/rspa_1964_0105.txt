tldr: The authors studied the decay of triplet states of naphthalene and anthracene in the gas phase using flash photolysis and kinetic spectrophotometry. They found that the decay is entirely due to second-order triplet-triplet quenching with nearly unit collision efficiency. The rate of decay is independent of pressure and temperature, and quenching by oxygen is about 100 times the collision rate. This research provides insights into the understanding of triplet kinetics in gases and helps in interpreting radiationless conversion processes.
