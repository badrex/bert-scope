tldr: The authors investigated the supersonic dispersion and vibrational activation of acetaldehyde molecules. They found that acetaldehyde exhibits a multiple dispersion region, which implies that certain intramolecular vibrations are activated independently. This study provides insights into the transfer of energy from translational to vibrational degrees of freedom in gas molecules.
