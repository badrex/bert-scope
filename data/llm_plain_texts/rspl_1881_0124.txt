tldr: This article presents a comparison between the diurnal ranges of magnetic declination recorded at Kew Observatory and the diurnal ranges of atmospheric temperature at Stonyhurst, Kew, and Falmouth observatories. The author suggests that both magnetic and meteorological changes are influenced by the sun and may take similar time to pass between different locations.
