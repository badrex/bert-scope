tldr: The authors conducted experiments and developed a mathematical model to study the performance of a catalytic monolith in controlling automobile exhaust emissions. They investigated chemical kinetics, mass transfer, and heat transfer effects using propane and air mixtures. The one-dimensional model predicted concentration and temperature responses better than the two-dimensional model, providing insights into improving catalytic monolith performance.
