tldr: The article discusses the United Kingdom's contribution to the International Biological Programme, focusing on the Meathop Wood and Pasoh rainforest projects. The Meathop Wood Project studied a deciduous broad-leafed forest in Lancashire, while the Pasoh rainforest project examined a virgin tropical lowland dipterocarp forest in central Malaya. The research aimed to understand energy balances, carbon and mineral cycling, and nutrient circulation within these ecosystems. The findings provide valuable insights into the dynamics of forest ecosystems and their complex interactions.
