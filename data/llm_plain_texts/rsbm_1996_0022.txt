tldr: This biographical memoir recounts the life of Claude Rimington, a notable biochemist and scientist, who made significant contributions to the fields of chemistry, natural history, and the humanities. Born in London in 1902, Rimington grew up in Hertfordshire and attended The Haberdasher Aske's Boys' School. His interests in literature, chemistry, and natural history led him to pursue a career in science. After a brief interruption due to health issues, Rimington attended Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he studied chemistry, physics, and botany. He later focused on biochemistry and worked on the phosphorylation of proteins and the structure of phosphoproteins. Rimington also had a passion for art, music, and literature, which he pursued alongside his scientific career. Throughout his life, he traveled extensively, including visits to Norway, Denmark, and South Africa, where he conducted research and made important connections in the scientific community.
