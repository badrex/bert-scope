tldr: The study investigates the mechanism of action of picrotoxinin, bicuculline, and penicillin-G on the GABA receptor system of lobster muscle. The researchers found that these convulsants have different effects on the GABA receptor, with picrotoxinin causing a lateral shift and depression in the GABA dose-conductance curve, while bicuculline and penicillin-G mainly cause depression. The study suggests that these convulsants may antagonize GABA responses by stabilizing the closed form of the activated channel or blocking it in the open state.
