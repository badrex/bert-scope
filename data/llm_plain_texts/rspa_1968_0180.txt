tldr: This article discusses the various factors that influence carbon formation in flames, such as flame front curvature, flow patterns, and the back diffusion of hydrogen. The authors analyze the role of these factors in the process of carbon formation and explain how they affect the limits of carbon formation in different types of flames.
