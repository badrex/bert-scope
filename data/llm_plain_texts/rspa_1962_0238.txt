tldr: The authors present a modified method for calculating the gravitational field of a rotating fluid mass in general relativity. They apply this method to a mass of perfect fluid, considering both homogeneous and heterogeneous cases. The study provides insights into the behavior of rotating fluid masses and has implications for understanding astronomical phenomena, such as the rotation of the sun with varying latitude.
