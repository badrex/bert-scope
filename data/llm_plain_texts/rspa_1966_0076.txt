tldr: The authors investigated grain growth in four close-packed hexagonal metals: magnesium, zinc, cadmium, and thallium. They found that maintaining a fixed temperature leads to a stable average grain diameter, and the relation between grain diameter and temperature is represented by a specific equation. The study provides quantitative laws for understanding grain growth in metals of this crystal structure.
