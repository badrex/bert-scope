tldr: This article compares magnetic declination changes at various British observatories, focusing on the diurnal inequalities and oscillations of the magnetic field. The study finds that the differences in magnetic changes between stations increase with the level of disturbance and that the variability in hourly values depends on whether the day is quiet or disturbed. The article also discusses the ratios of oscillation amplitudes at different stations and highlights the need for further investigation to understand the phenomena fully.
