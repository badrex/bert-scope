tldr: The authors re-interpret a method for obtaining non-separable, localized solutions of the homogeneous wave equation and the Klein-Gordon equation. They introduce a geometrical consideration of the algebraic constraint that the Fourier transforms of these solutions must satisfy in the transform domain. This approach allows them to design classes of solutions with better localization properties, including subluminal and superluminal waves.
