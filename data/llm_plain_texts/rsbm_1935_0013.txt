He returned to England and worked at Owens College before joining the Yorkshire College, Leeds, where he became a full professor of organic chemistry. Cohen was a dedicated teacher and researcher, and his work on the history of chemistry and antiseptic action of substances was well-regarded. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society and received honorary degrees from the University of Glasgow and the University of Leeds.
