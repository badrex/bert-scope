tldr: The author examines the relationship between the sun's magnetic field and the Earth's magnetic field. They explore the possibility that the sun acts as a magnet on the Earth, but conclude that this hypothesis cannot fully explain the diurnal variations of the Earth's magnetism. The author suggests that other unknown forces may be at play, and that the sun's direct influence on Earth's magnetism is likely small in comparison.
