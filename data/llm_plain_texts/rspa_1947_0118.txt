tldr: The authors study the application of the hodograph transformation to trans-sonic flow problems in symmetrical channels. They investigate the behavior of the flow near the sonic line, where singularities in the transformation arise, and explore the line of branch-points in the hodograph plane. The study provides insights into the design of channels for supersonic wind tunnels, where velocities increase steadily on every streamline.
