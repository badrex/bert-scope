tldr: The author conducted experiments to compare the elastic properties of Rochelle salt and Ammonium Seignette salt, which are isomorphous crystals. By replacing the potassium atom with the ammonium group, the author found that the elastic properties of the two salts differ, with the ammonium salt being less fragile and having a slightly smaller space-lattice in two directions. The study provides insights into the physical effects of chemical changes in complex molecules.
