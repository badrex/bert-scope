tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the angular distribution of beta-radiation from light nuclei, specifically focusing on proton capture. They used a parallel beam of protons and a target made of the material under investigation. The results provide insights into the properties of radiative transitions and the nuclear processes involved.
