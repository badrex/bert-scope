tldr: The authors explore the similarities between two cases of magnetic resonance in oscillating fields, case A and case B, and demonstrate how to transform them to make the problems more solvable. They discuss the conditions under which the zero-order approximation is dominant and present a method to calculate higher-order corrections. The study helps to understand the behavior of atoms in oscillating fields and improve the accuracy of magnetic resonance experiments.
