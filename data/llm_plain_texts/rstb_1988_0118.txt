tldr: The article discusses the role of autosomal genes in mammalian primary sex determination. It presents evidence supporting the hypothesis that the mammalian Y chromosome carries a gene that induces the undifferentiated foetal gonad in XY individuals to develop as a testis. The author also identifies autosomal genes, such as Tda-1, that interact with the Y-linked testis-determining gene to initiate testis formation or cause abnormal development, resulting in the formation of ovarian tissue in XY individuals.
