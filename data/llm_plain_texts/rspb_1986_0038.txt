tldr: This study investigates the biomineralization process of iron oxide in the radula teeth of the limpet Patella vulgata using Mossbauer spectroscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The results show that the teeth contain two iron-containing phases: a superparamagnetic, poorly ordered goethite-like component and well-ordered goethite crystals. The findings provide insights into the complexity and specificity of solid-state bioinorganic processes in organisms.
