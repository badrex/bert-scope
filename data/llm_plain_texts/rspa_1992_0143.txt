tldr: The author derives a meridional velocity equation, which is an inhomogeneous form of the spheroidal wave equation, to solve the frictionless Laplace's tidal equations for long-period zonal tides in a constant-depth global ocean. The solution is obtained by expanding the meridional velocity in associated Legendre functions, providing additional information on the structure of the tidal equations and allowing for simpler recurrence relations for the solution coefficients.
