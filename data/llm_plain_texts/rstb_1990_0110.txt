tldr: The study examines the bird colonization of Anak Krakatau, an emergent volcanic island, in the 1980s. It provides a model for the early colonization processes that occurred on the archipelago in the first two decades of the 20th century. The research focuses on the abundance, foraging ecology, and habitat use of the bird species that compose the avian community on Anak Krakatau.
