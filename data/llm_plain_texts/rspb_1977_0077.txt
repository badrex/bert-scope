tldr: The authors studied the mechanism of K cell (antibody-dependent) cell-mediated cytotoxicity by examining the release of different cell components during the process. They found that small molecules like chromium-51 and phosphoryl choline are released at a similar rate as macromolecules like protein and RNA, suggesting a sudden rupture of the cytoplasmic membrane. DNA release occurs more slowly, with a 30-45 min lag. These findings indicate that K cell cytotoxicity occurs rapidly after contact and may involve a similar type of explosive event as T cell cytotoxicity.
