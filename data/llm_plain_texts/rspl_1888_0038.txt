tldr: The author describes a method to find the minimum-point of change of potential in a voltaic couple without using a thermo-electric pile. The method involves balancing the electric potential of a couple with small quantities of a substance in water. The author also discusses the relationship between the minimum-point and the chemical composition of the liquid, the type of metals used, and the temperature. This research can be used to test the purity and uniformity of dissolved substances.
