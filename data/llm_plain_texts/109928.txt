tldr: Edward Sabine conducted observations on the dip and variation of the magnetic needle and the intensity of the magnetic force during a voyage in search of a North-West Passage. He used a dipping-needle similar to one described by Mr. Cavendish and focused on understanding the effects of the ship's iron on compasses in high latitudes. The results are presented in a series of tables.
