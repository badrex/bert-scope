tldr: Gideon Algernon Mantell presents his supplementary observations on the structure of the Belemnite and Belemnoteuthis, two genera of fossil Cephalopoda found in the Oxford clay of Wiltshire. He provides evidence to support the distinction between these two extinct forms of Cephalopoda and describes the various parts of their organization, such as the external capsule, osselet, and phragmocone. Mantell also discusses the differences between the Belemnite and Belemnoteuthis, as well as the soft parts of the animals, which are still unknown.
