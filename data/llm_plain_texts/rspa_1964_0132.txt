tldr: This article explores the diamagnetism of conduction electrons in dilute alloys and the magnetic field-dependent dielectric constant of a Fermi gas. The authors calculate the partition function and the free energy for complete degeneracy, considering the effects of impurity centers and a magnetic field. They also discuss the self-consistent determination of the impurity potential and its modification in the presence of a magnetic field. The results provide insights into the behavior of alloys and the dielectric constant of a Fermi gas under varying magnetic fields.
