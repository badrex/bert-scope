tldr: The authors studied the absorption spectrum of Cd\lt;sub\gt;I\lt;/sub\gt; below 30\#xC5; using synchrotron radiation. Their results confirmed the predictions of a one-electron model but also showed some discrepancies, indicating the need for refining the theory and considering the effects of electron-electron correlation and collective excitation.
