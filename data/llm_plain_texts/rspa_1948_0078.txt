tldr: The authors develop a general kinetic theory of liquids, focusing on liquid helium II, and explain the anomalous viscosity and thermal conduction phenomena. They propose a new interpretation of the superfluidity and provide a detailed analysis of the thermodynamics and elementary thermal processes in helium II.
