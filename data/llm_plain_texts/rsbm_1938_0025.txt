tldr: "The obituary of Lord Rutherford highlights his significant contributions to the fields of physics and radioactivity. Rutherford conducted pioneering experiments on wireless waves and magnetism, and his work on the conduction of electricity through gases led to new discoveries in physics. He later studied the radiations from uranium and discovered alpha and beta rays, as well as the emanation from thorium. Rutherford's research on radioactive change, alongside Soddy, laid the foundation for understanding atomic properties and radioactivity."
