tldr: The article discusses the geological history and evolution of Mount Kinabalu, a granodiorite body of early Pliocene age, which is part of the Western Cordillera in Borneo. The mountain's formation is attributed to folding and uplift of the north-west Borneo geosyncline, with significant events occurring in the Oligocene, Miocene, and Pliocene periods. The Kinabalu massif is composed of four main rock units, including sedimentary rocks, ultrabasic and basic rocks, granodiorite, and rock debris and alluvium. The article provides insights into the geological history and potential future research opportunities in the area.
