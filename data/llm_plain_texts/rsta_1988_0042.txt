tldr: This article examines water mass transport and ventilation in the Northeast Atlantic using tracer data. The authors collected a large dataset of 3He and tritium samples from 1977 to 1984, allowing them to create tracer distributions on isopycnal surfaces. They found a distinct southward increase in age, which helped them quantify the interior transport and determine the direction of water movement. The study concluded that the layers of the Northeast Atlantic are ventilated by advection from the subpolar region.
