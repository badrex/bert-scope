tldr: The Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell focuses on conducting research in chemistry, physics, metallurgy, and engineering for the atomic-energy program. They produce radioactive and stable isotopes, distribute them, and encourage their application in the country. The establishment also investigates the potentialities of nuclear energy as a source of power. Key research areas include nuclear constants measurement, neutron fission, capture, and scattering cross-sections, and the effects of neutron bombardment on solid-state properties.
