tldr: The author examines the structure of striped muscle fibers using new methods of investigation, such as creating impressions in collodion. They discover that the cross-striping of muscle fibers is an optical expression of their varicose nature and not due to internal structural differences. This finding challenges the widely held belief that alternating stripes in muscle fibers represent different structures and contributes to a better understanding of muscle contraction.
