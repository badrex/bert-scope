tldr: This study investigates the yield stress and flow stress of single crystals of Cu-Ni-Pd and Cu-Pd alloys. The researchers found that the concentration dependence of the critical resolved shear stress at the yield point for both alloy series can be described by a power law. The results establish the stress equivalence behavior of single crystals of these alloys and provide insights into solute hardening and the development of high-yield stress alloys.
