tldr: This article discusses the internal structures and rotation of the major planets in the Solar System, focusing on Uranus and Neptune. The authors use the Darwin-Radau relation to analyze the moment of inertia factor and determine the degree of central condensation of the planets. They also explore the influence of satellites on the precession rates of the Uranian rings and the effect on the determination of planetary parameters. The study concludes that Uranus is likely the most centrally condensed planet in the Solar System.
