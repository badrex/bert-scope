tldr: This article discusses the epidemiology and ecology of infectious disease agents, specifically focusing on human schistosomiasis. The author presents longitudinal studies conducted in Kenya and The Gambia to understand the existence and mechanisms of acquired immunity to schistosome infection. The studies examine the rate of reinfection following chemotherapeutic treatment and the impact of acquired immunity on limiting infection among older individuals. The article also explores the potential implications of these findings for immunological intervention through vaccination.
