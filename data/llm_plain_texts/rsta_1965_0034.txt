tldr: The author examines Icelandic geology to provide evidence of crustal drift and dilation. They measure visible dilation in active volcanic zones and dykes that fed Tertiary lavas, finding that a substantial amount of dilation could be achieved through dyke injection. The study suggests that Iceland's structure may involve an appreciable amount of crustal drifting, which could have implications for understanding the movement of continents.
