tldr: This article discusses the immune recognition of protein antigens and the structure of T-cell receptors. It explores the similarities between T-cell receptors and antibodies, as well as the differences in their diversities. The authors present a model for the interaction between T-cell receptors and a complex of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) plus antigen, suggesting that the geometry of the combining sites will be similar to that of antibodies.
