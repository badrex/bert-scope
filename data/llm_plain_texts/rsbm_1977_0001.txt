tldr: 'The article is a biographical memoir of Thomas Archibald Bennet-Clark, a notable botanist and chemist. Born in Edinburgh, Bennet-Clark was influenced by his family's history of distinguished careers and his father's interests in flora and botany. He attended Wells House School and Marlborough College, where he developed interests in mathematics and chemistry. Bennet-Clark went on to study at Cambridge University, where he earned a first-class degree in botany and conducted research on plant physiology and metabolism. He later worked as an assistant and collaborator to Professor H. H. Dixon in Dublin, and then as a lecturer in botany at Manchester. Bennet-Clark's research focused on geotropism and plant growth, and he was known for his enthusiastic and supportive nature, both professionally and personally.'
