tldr: The author revisits the Bennettitalean flower Williamsoniella, providing new insights into its floral structure and taxonomy. They describe the various floral organs, including the perianth, microsporophylls, and gynoecium, and reveal similarities between Williamsoniella and Cycadeoidea. The study concludes that Williamsoniella is more taxonomically related to Cycadeoidea than previously thought.
