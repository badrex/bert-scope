tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the ionization potentials of magnesium and other metals, focusing on their absorption spectra. They discovered that magnesium vapor absorbs light at specific wavelengths, and the absorption spectrum of magnesium exhibits bands at X = 2852.22 A.U. and X = 2026.46 A.U. These findings contribute to the understanding of the behavior of metals under different conditions.
