  - Asymptotic behavior
  - Radiation field
tldr: The authors explore the radiation field of pulse solutions of the wave equation, focusing on the behavior of the field at a great distance from the origin. They demonstrate that a solution of the wave equation is uniquely determined by its radiation field and can be expressed in terms of a simple integral representation when the solution is axially symmetric.
