tldr: The author conducted a cytochemical study on the distribution of enzymes in the cytoplasm of amoebae, specifically focusing on succinic dehydrogenase, dipeptidase, and catheptic proteinase. They compared two methods of enzyme distribution analysis: centrifugal stratification of living cells and homogenization of tissues. The study found that enzymes like succinic dehydrogenase and proteinase were more likely bound to mitochondria, while dipeptidase was predominantly localized in the hyaline cytoplasm. The results suggest that the centrifugal stratification method may be less prone to artifact formation than the homogenization method.
