tldr: This paper presents a complete classical theory of spinning particles moving in a Maxwell field, taking into account the effects of radiation reaction. The theory is consistent with the principle of relativity and includes equations for the motion of the particle, which are consistent with the conservation of energy, momentum, and angular momentum. The mass, angular momentum of the spin, and the moment of inertia perpendicular to the spin axis appear as arbitrary mechanical constants. The theory is applicable to particles with an explicit spin interaction with the Maxwell field, such as protons and neutrons.
