tldr: The article discusses the use of acoustic microscopy for non-destructive examination and validation of surface cracks. It explains how the technique works by using Rayleigh waves to image and detect fine surface cracks, and provides examples of its applications in analyzing metal fatigue and ceramic engineering. The authors also present a theoretical analysis of the contrast in acoustic micrographs and the role of Rayleigh waves in the imaging process.
