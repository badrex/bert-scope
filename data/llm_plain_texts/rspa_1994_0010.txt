tldr: This article investigates the swelling of shale around a cylindrical wellbore and how it can be inhibited. The authors apply a modified form of Biot's linear theory of poroelasticity to understand the phenomenon. They find that swelling can be prevented if the chemical potential of water within the shale equals that within the wellbore. The predictions of the analysis are compared with experimental results, showing that salt concentration in the wellbore fluid plays a crucial role in preventing shale swelling.
