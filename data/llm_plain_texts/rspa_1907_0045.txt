tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the spontaneous crystallization of binary mixtures, specifically salol and betol. They determined the temperature of spontaneous crystallization by tracing the supersolubility curve and observed multiple freezing points in the mixtures. The study provides insights into the process of crystallization in alloys and other mixtures, contributing to the understanding of their freezing points and solidification behavior.
