tldr: This article presents a general introduction to five papers discussing various problems of gravity waves in perfect liquids. The authors explore the diffraction theory of sea waves, the dispersion of fluid under gravity, and the collapse of liquid columns. They also describe experiments related to atomic bomb explosions and their aftermath, such as the "base surge." The papers provide insights into the behavior of sea waves, breakwaters, and the effects of large underwater explosions.
