tldr: This study investigates the microstructure and crystallography of aluminum-silicon eutectic alloys, focusing on the growth mechanisms and factors that influence their formation. The researchers describe three distinct growth processes and discuss the role of composition, freezing rate, and temperature gradient in shaping the microstructures. They also compare the microstructures of eutectic alloys in the aluminum-silicon and silver-silicon systems, highlighting similarities and differences in their formation mechanisms.
