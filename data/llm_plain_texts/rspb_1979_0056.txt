tldr: 'This article discusses the long-term hazards of polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) in Michigan. Inadvertent contamination of farm feed with PBBs occurred in 1973, leading to widespread distribution of contaminated food and most Michigan citizens having detectable levels of PBBs in their bodies. A clinical field survey showed an unusual prevalence of specific symptoms, particularly neuro-behavioural, in dairy farm residents exposed to PBBs compared to a control group in Wisconsin. The long-term significance of these observations is still being studied.'
