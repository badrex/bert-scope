tldr: 'This study investigates the fine structure of cell walls in fifteen species of red algae using X-ray diffraction analysis and electron microscopy. The authors found that all species have a similar wall structure made up of numerous lamellae containing random microfibrils in an amorphous matrix. They also discovered that none of the red algae species contain cellulose I and that the presence of crystalline floridean starch complicates the X-ray diagrams in some species.'
