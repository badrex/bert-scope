tldr: This article investigates chaotic motions in a periodically forced impacting system, similar to Duffing's equation with negative linear stiffness. The authors focus on predicting and manipulating cross-well chaos in the system. They develop a method to determine parameter conditions for homoclinic tangles and explore the effects of higher harmonics on the range of excitation amplitudes. The study also relates the rate of cross-well excursions to the rate of phase space flux in a Poincaré map, providing insights into how various system and input parameters influence chaotic properties.
