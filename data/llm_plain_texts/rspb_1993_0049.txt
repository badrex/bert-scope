tldr: The authors developed a mathematical model to determine the optimal measles vaccination strategy for populations with varying transmission rates and costs. They found that different strategies should be used for different groups within the population, with a smaller fraction of the minority group being vaccinated if the transmission rate is not much higher than the majority group. This non-uniform vaccination policy can result in fewer people being vaccinated overall compared to a uniform policy.
