tldr: The authors conducted electron microscope studies on evaporating liquid lead and solid silver particles to verify the Kelvin equation, which relates equilibrium vapor pressure to surface curvature. They confirmed the equation for liquid lead particles and used it to calculate the mean surface energy of solid silver particles.
