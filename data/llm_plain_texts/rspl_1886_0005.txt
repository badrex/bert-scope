tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of sunlight on microorganisms and found that sunlight has an oxidizing effect on many organic substances. They demonstrated that sunlight can destroy the properties of invertive diastase of yeast and confirmed that the action of sunlight on organisms is an oxidation process. This research has implications for understanding the impact of sunlight on microbial growth and the environment.
