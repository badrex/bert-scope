tldr: The authors study fractal colloid aggregates using static and dynamic light scattering. They find that the dynamic light scattering data for different colloids can be scaled onto a single master curve, which is sensitive to the structure of the aggregates and their mass distribution. The authors' predictions for the shape of the master curve for different cluster distributions match the experimental data for diffusion-limited and reaction-limited colloid aggregation. This provides convincing evidence of the universality of these two regimes of colloid aggregation.
