revised_title: The Law of Mass and Chemical Change in Gases: Equilibrium and Inflammability

tldr: The author conducted experiments with carbonic oxide, hydrogen, and oxygen gases to study chemical change and combustion. They discovered that the Law of Mass applies to these gaseous systems, and the division of oxygen depends on the relative affinity of the combustibles and the quantities present. The author also found that the presence of steam and other substances can make the gas mixtures explosive or inflammable. The experiments showed that the velocity of explosion increases with increasing quantities of steam, and the division of oxygen is independent of the shape of the vessel and the initial pressure above a "critical pressure."
