tldr: 'This article celebrates the life and work of Sir Charles Sherrington, a pioneering neuroscientist who revolutionized our understanding of the nervous system. Sherrington's research on the brain and nerves provided a new outlook on how sense organs, the brain, and muscles work together to control our movements and maintain balance. His work on feed-back mechanisms, now used in engineering, has had a lasting impact on the field of neuroscience. Sherrington's contributions earned him numerous awards, including the Nobel Prize and membership in the Order of Merit.'
