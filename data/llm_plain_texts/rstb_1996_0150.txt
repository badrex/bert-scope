tldr: The authors analyze measles outbreaks in the Faroe Islands, a small isolated community, and find that the distribution of epidemic sizes and durations follows a power-law behavior. This suggests the existence of an underlying scaling mechanism in the measles case returns, which is not purely stochastic. The study provides a novel way to consider the dynamics of other communicable diseases with frequent fade-out in case returns.
