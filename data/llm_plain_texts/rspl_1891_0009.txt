tldr: The author investigates the process of electrical evaporation, where the passage of an electric current stimulates the motion of gaseous molecules near the negative electrode. This process is similar to ordinary evaporation by heat. The author conducts experiments with water and metal cadmium, observing that evaporation is more rapid at the negative pole, and the metal deposits on the walls of the vacuum tube. This research contributes to the understanding of the effects of electricity on the evaporation and deposition of metals.
