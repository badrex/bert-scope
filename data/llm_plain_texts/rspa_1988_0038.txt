tldr: This article investigates the oscillatory behavior of simple exothermic reactions in a closed system using the exact Arrhenius kinetics. The authors find that oscillations emerge from points of Hopf bifurcation and can result in stable and unstable limit cycles. The study provides insights into the chemical and physical significance of the reactions' behavior and the conditions for the onset and disappearance of oscillations.
