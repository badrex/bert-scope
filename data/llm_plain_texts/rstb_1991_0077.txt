tldr: The article discusses the evolution of plant secondary chemical diversification and how it helps in plant defense mechanisms. It suggests that plants have a high number of inactive secondary compounds, which increases the probability of producing active compounds in the face of consumer adaptation. The author argues that plants with a high chemical diversity are better defended against potential threats, such as herbivores and pathogens, and that this diversification incurs costs but is advantageous for the plant's survival.
