tldr: The authors conducted a study on the effects of sex hormones on the hydatids of Morgagni in humans and monkeys. They found that male and female hormones had different effects on the hydatids, with male hormones causing regression and female hormones promoting growth. The study also provided insights into the embryological development and topography of the hydatids.
