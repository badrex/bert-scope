tldr: Researchers used X-ray crystallography to study the structure of ribonuclease, a protein that breaks down RNA. They found that the molecule contains six polypeptide chains and suggested that it might be made up of two half or short chains and four longer chains. The presence of a Pauling-Corey alpha-helix in the protein is questioned, and the possibility of flattened chains is considered instead. This research provides insights into the complex structure of proteins and the role of X-ray crystallography in understanding them.
