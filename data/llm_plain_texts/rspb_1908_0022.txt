tldr: The authors conducted a study on a dog to understand the origin and destiny of cholesterol in the animal organism. They found that cholesterol is not produced by the dog's metabolism but is derived from the food, specifically from grass-fed herbivorous animals. The study also showed that cholesterol is excreted in the faeces and that the dog's body does not modify it as it does in humans. The authors investigated the dog's cholesterol excretion while feeding it different diets, including oatmeal porridge, cooked beef and mutton, and sheep's brain.
