tldr: The authors apply Taylor's modified vorticity transport theory of turbulence to calculate the velocity and temperature distributions in the turbulent wake behind a heated body of revolution in a uniform stream. They assume geometrical and mechanical similarity and isotropy in turbulence, and compare their theoretical curve of velocity distribution with experimental observations of Schlichting and Simmons.
