tldr: This article discusses the dynamics of natural populations and the factors that contribute to rapid micro-evolution. It highlights the importance of ecological genetics, population fluctuations, and isolating mechanisms in the evolution of species. The author also mentions the potential for studying micro-evolution through the analysis of small, isolated populations and the role of polyploidy in species adaptation.
