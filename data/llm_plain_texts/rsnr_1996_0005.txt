tldr: This article examines the illness of Mary Darwin, wife of Dr. Erasmus Darwin, and provides a retrospective diagnosis based on new evidence.

The article also discusses the limited knowledge of liver and biliary tract diseases in the late 18th century and how it may have affected Mary's treatment.
