  - Methyl Alcohol
  - Ionic Association
tldr: This article investigates the conductivity of thiocyanates in methyl alcohol and compares it with Onsager's theory. The results show that the lithium thiocyanate has the least association, while the association increases with the atomic number of the metal. The study also discusses the possible reasons for ionic association, such as the Bjerrum and Fajans theories.
