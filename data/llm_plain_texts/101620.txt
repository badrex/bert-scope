tldr: The author reports on the discovery of an abundance of ancient oak and fir trees found underground in the Isle of Axholme, a region in Lincolnshire and Yorkshire. These trees, some reaching up to 36 yards in length, were buried due to the overflow of the fenlands caused by the muddiness of the tides. This discovery was confirmed by the historical accounts of Mr. Dugdale in his book on draining the fens in England.
