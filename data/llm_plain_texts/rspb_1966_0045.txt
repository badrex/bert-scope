tldr: The study investigates the rate-limiting step in the recovery of acetylcholine sensitivity in smooth muscle after exposure to atropine or hyoscine. The research compares two models, the dissociation-limited model and the biophase model, to understand the kinetics of action of acetylcholine antagonists. The findings support the dissociation-limited model and suggest that measurements of antagonist kinetics can be a valid guide to drug-receptor rate constants.
