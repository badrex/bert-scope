tldr: The study examines the accommodatory system in two teleost fish species, mackerel and bass. The lens muscle's structure and innervation are characterized, and the neural pathway controlling the lens muscle is analyzed. The lens muscle contains smooth muscle cells with numerous mitochondria and synaptic endings. The nerve controlling the lens muscle has less than 100 myelinated nerve fibers, and electrical stimulation demonstrates that it is controlled by postganglionic fibers of the oculomotor (parasympathetic) nerve. The ultrastructural features of the lens muscle and its nerve control resemble those of the mammalian ciliary muscle.
