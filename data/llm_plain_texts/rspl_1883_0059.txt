tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the influence of water in the atmosphere on the solar spectrum and solar temperature. They compared their findings with previous research and confirmed the correctness of Langley's wave-lengths. The study also explored the effect of different thicknesses of water on the absorption of solar radiation.
