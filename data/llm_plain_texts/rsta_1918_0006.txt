tldr: The author investigates the crystallographic properties of four double selenates in the nickel group, focusing on potassium, rubidium, cesium, and ammonium nickel selenates. They describe the crystal habits, cleavage, density, optical properties, and refractive indices of these compounds, providing valuable data for future research in the field of crystallography.
