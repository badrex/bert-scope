tldr: The authors studied the molecular mechanisms of cell locomotion in Acanthamoeba, focusing on the functions of actin and myosin. They determined the three-dimensional structure of actin, examined the mechanism of actin polymerization, and investigated the regulation of actin polymerization by binding proteins. They also tested the physiological functions of myosin-II using monoclonal antibodies, which inhibited amoeboid locomotion when microinjected into living cells.
