tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments to study the influence of temperature on the absorption of water by Hordeum Vulgare seeds. They found that the rate at which water is absorbed is an exponential function of temperature. The presence of ethylic acetate in the solution also accelerates the absorption rate. This suggests that the solute may simplify the molecular structure of water, allowing it to enter the seeds more quickly.'
