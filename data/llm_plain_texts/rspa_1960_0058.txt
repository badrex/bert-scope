tldr: This article investigates the reactions of oxygen on dark and irradiated zinc oxide surfaces. The authors discuss chemisorption, the development of a potential barrier, and the influence of the boundary layer on adsorption and desorption processes. They also explore the role of temperature and irradiation wavelength in photo-adsorption and negative photoconductivity.
