tldr: This study investigates the effect of different stress states on grain boundary cavitation in Nimonic material. The authors found that the number of cavities per unit volume was a function of shear strain and independent of the stress state. They also discovered that most cavities were on grain boundaries parallel to the maximum principal stress axis. During tensile creep, cavity growth occurred preferentially on these parallel boundaries, which affected the material's creep ductility.
