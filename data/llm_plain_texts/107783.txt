tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study how birds respire and the effects of different gases on their respiration. They found that when birds breathe in atmospheric air, they convert a portion of the oxygen into carbonic acid gas. When exposed to a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen, birds absorb hydrogen and release a proportionate amount of nitrogen. These findings support the conclusion that birds' respiration primarily involves the exchange of oxygen and carbonic acid, with little change in the nitrogen content of the air.
