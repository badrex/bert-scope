tldr: The authors investigated the insect fauna found in the organic deposits at Sugworth and analyzed their distribution and environmental implications. The insect remains, predominantly beetles, were not evenly distributed but formed distinct peaks, suggesting periodic flooding. The insect fauna indicates a climate at least as warm as, or possibly slightly warmer than, the present day. The authors concluded that the deposits' age and stratigraphy support a likely Cromerian age.
