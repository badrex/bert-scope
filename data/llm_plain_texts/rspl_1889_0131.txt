tldr: The author discusses the evolution of birds and the significance of peculiarities in the hyoid tongue-bone. They argue that the degraded character of the hyoid portion of the tongue-bone in certain bird species is not of fundamental importance in understanding their evolution. The author suggests that both Ratitae and Carinatae may have derived from an early group of typical flying birds or Proto-Garinatce.
