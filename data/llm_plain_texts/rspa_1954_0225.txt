tldr: This article revisits the theory of second-order effects caused by acoustic disturbances in fluids, focusing on vorticity and the ultrasonic wind. It discusses the role of solid boundaries and the fluid's thermodynamic relaxation properties in the generation of vorticity and the ultrasonic wind. The author concludes that ultrasonic wind speed measurements can be used to determine the second coefficient of viscosity or as a measurement of a relaxation process independent of this coefficient.
