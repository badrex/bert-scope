tldr: The authors present a theoretical approach to assess the Suess effect, which is the decrease in atmospheric carbon-14 concentrations caused by the combustion of large quantities of inactive fossil fuels. They calculate the reduction in carbon-14 specific activities and predict that the effect will become more significant in the future, reaching about -23% by 2000 and -50% by 2025. This study is important for understanding the impact of human activities on atmospheric carbon-14 concentrations and its potential consequences on climate change.
