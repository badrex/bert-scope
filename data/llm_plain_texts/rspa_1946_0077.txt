tldr: The authors study the distribution of stress around a crack in an elastic solid under the influence of internal pressure. They analyze both two-dimensional and circular cracks, providing stress components, tabulations, and graphical representations of stress distribution. The research contributes to understanding the conditions for rupture in non-ductile materials like glass.
