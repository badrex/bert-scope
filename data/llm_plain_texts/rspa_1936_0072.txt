tldr: This article presents the microtome method for measuring the absolute amount of adsorption at static air-water interfaces. The authors apply this method to solutions of hydrocinnamic acid, phenol, and sodium chloride, comparing the results with those postulated by the Gibbs adsorption theorem. The microtome method provides a more accurate and controlled way to study adsorption at interfaces, which is essential for understanding various chemical and physical processes.
