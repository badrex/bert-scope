tldr: This article presents an elementary theory of hydromagnetic turbulence, which is similar to Heisenberg's theory of ordinary turbulence. The author develops a scheme to understand the transformation of energy in hydromagnetic turbulence, considering the transition probabilities of kinetic and magnetic energy at different wave numbers. The theory suggests that there are two distinct modes of turbulence, the velocity mode and the magnetic mode, with different behaviors for smaller eddies. The results have implications for understanding interstellar magnetic fields.
