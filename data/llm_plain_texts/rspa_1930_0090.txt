tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the excitation of soft X-rays from a single crystal face of nickel. They discovered that the intensity of the soft X-ray inflections was dependent on the crystal face and the treatment of the target. The results showed that the intensity of the soft X-rays from the crystal was greater than from a polycrystalline nickel, and the curve of intensity versus applied potential differed significantly. The authors suggested that further experiments were needed to understand the phenomenon of soft X-ray excitation from metallic surfaces.
