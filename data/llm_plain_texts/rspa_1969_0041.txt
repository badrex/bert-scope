tldr: The authors conducted experiments on ultrasonic attenuation in superconducting tin and found that the attenuation decreases with increasing purity. They developed a simple model to explain the effect of elastic scattering in anisotropic superconductors, which accounts for the lack of orientational differences and the variation of attenuation with purity. This study contributes to the understanding of ultrasonic attenuation and thermal conductivity in anisotropic materials.
