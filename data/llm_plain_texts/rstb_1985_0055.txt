tldr: This study investigates the autonomic responses and analgesic effects of stimulating the periaqueductal grey matter (PAG) in rats. The researchers found that stimulation in the dorsal PAG evoked a defense reaction, including cardiovascular and respiratory changes, and increased the latency of the tail flick response. In contrast, stimulation in the ventral PAG produced analgesia without visceral alerting. Both autonomic and analgesic effects were blocked after bilateral lesions of the ventrolateral medulla. The study suggests that the analgesia from dorsal PAG stimulation is part of a stress response mediated through the ventrolateral medulla.
