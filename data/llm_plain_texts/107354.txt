tldr: The author conducted experiments on heated glass and unannealed glass drops to study their optical properties and structure. They discovered that the drops exhibit unique crystalline structures and behaviors when exposed to heat, which can affect their density and optical properties. The findings have implications for understanding the formation of our planet and the consolidation of various materials.
