revised_title: 'Interior Solution in General Relativity: A New Approach'
semantic_tags:
  - General Relativity
  - Gravitational Mass Density
  - Schwarzschild Interior Solution
  - Differential Equations
  - Cosmical Constant
tldr: The author presents a new interior solution in general relativity, focusing on the field of a sphere with constant gravitational mass density. The Schwarzschild interior solution is discussed, and new formulae are provided for the field of a fluid sphere with constant density. The author also considers the cosmical constant and its potential impact on the solution.
