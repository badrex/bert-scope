tldr: The article discusses the causes and consequences of eutrophication, a process where water bodies are enriched with plant nutrients, leading to excessive growth of algae and other aquatic plants. The main sources of enrichment are sewage, artificial fertilizers, and agricultural wastes. Eutrophication can cause difficulties in water supply, harm recreational activities, and threaten the conservation of aquatic ecosystems. The author highlights the need for increased research and understanding of the complex interactions between environmental factors to better predict and mitigate the effects of eutrophication.
