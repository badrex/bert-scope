tldr: The authors conducted an experiment to analyze the lighter constituents of the air using spectroscopy. They found that the neon spectrum is more complex than previously thought, and discovered a new spectrum of hydrogen that appears only under certain conditions. Although they did not find a new gas, they made significant progress in understanding the composition of air and the behavior of neon and hydrogen in the air.
