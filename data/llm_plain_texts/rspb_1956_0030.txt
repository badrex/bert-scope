tldr: The authors studied the breakdown of 14C-labelled glucose, pyruvate, and lactate in the blood of cats, rabbits, and dogs to understand the carbohydrate metabolism in blood cells. They found that the process is dependent on oxygen and is affected by temperature and enzyme poisons. The results support the idea that a direct oxidative pathway for glucose, called the 'hexose-monophosphate shunt,' operates in leucocytes.
