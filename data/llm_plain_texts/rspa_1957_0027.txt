tldr: This article examines the quantum-statistical ergodic and H-theorems, focusing on the assumptions and conditions required for their validity. The author critiques previous arguments and provides a more simplified approach to understanding the probability distribution of finding a non-thermodynamic observer. The study concludes that the ergodic theorem holds for most macroscopic observables, while acknowledging the possibility of violations in specific cases.
