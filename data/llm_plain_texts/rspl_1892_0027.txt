  - Magnetic disturbances
tldr: This study investigates the simultaneity of magnetic disturbances at different locations and their relation to earth currents. The author compares the times of initial magnetic movements at various observatories and finds that they are nearly simultaneous, suggesting a global magnetic impulse. The research also examines the connection between magnetic movements and earth currents, showing that earth currents often precede magnetic disturbances. The author emphasizes the importance of improving time scales for magnetical and meteorological phenomena to better understand these relationships.
