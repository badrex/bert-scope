tldr: This study investigates the uptake and re-use of sympathetic transmitter in the cat's spleen. The researchers found that the spleen takes up and re-uses the sympathetic transmitter, which is important for maintaining the level of transmitter liberation from the nerves. The study also shows that the artificial perfusion method used in the experiment closely resembles the behavior of the spleen in its natural state.
