tldr: The authors investigate the deformation of the Earth's lithosphere by continental ice sheets, focusing on the elastic-viscoplastic flexure beyond the ice sheet's point load. They propose a one-dimensional model to analyze the problem, considering the lithosphere as a semi-infinite beam on a frictionless elastic foundation. The study provides insights into the importance of a correct lithosphere rheology for assessing vertical displacements caused by glacial loading and unloading.
