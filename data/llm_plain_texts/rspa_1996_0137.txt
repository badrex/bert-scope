tldr: This study investigates the dynamical response of a driven beam and the onset of period-1 impacting motions. A simple mathematical model is used to capture the behavior of the beam, allowing the researchers to identify zones separating regular period-1 impacting solutions from irregular, chaotic, and non-impacting motions. The research focuses on understanding the bifurcations that lead to period-1 impacts and provides insight into the behavior of engineering structures during dynamic motions.
