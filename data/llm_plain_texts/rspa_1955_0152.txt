tldr: The author investigates the fluid motion and wave generation caused by a floating sphere making periodic oscillations. They derive the velocity potential and obtain expressions for the virtual inertia coefficient and the equivalent damping parameter. The study provides insights into the behavior of waves and pressure on the sphere, which can be useful for understanding ship dynamics and designing better ships.
