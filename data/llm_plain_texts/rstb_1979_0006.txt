tldr: This study examines the Middle Cambrian polychaetes found in the Burgess Shale of British Columbia, providing detailed descriptions and analysis of their anatomy, preservation, and possible behaviors. The polychaetes, despite their soft bodies, were well-preserved in the Burgess Shale, offering valuable insights into the evolution and diversification of early Palaeozoic marine life. The authors also discuss the significance of the Burgess Shale fauna in understanding the history of metazoan evolution and the importance of soft-bodied organisms in the Cambrian Period.
