tldr: The article examines the ultrastructure of the nucleolus during prophase of meiosis in three plants using electron microscopy. The study focuses on the fine structure of the nucleolar organizer, its relationship to the synaptonemal complex, and the presence of pseudonucleoli in pollen mother cells. The findings provide insights into the nucleolar organizing region and its role in meiosis.
