tldr: The article investigates wave propagation in monatomic lattices with anharmonic potential using Whitham's variational method. The nonlinear dispersion relation is obtained, which shows that the periodic dependence of frequency on wavenumber and the existence of a cutoff frequency are preserved. The expansion of the lattice is found to be positive, and the Gruneisen ratio is determined by wavenumber and force constants.
