tldr: In this 1942 Bakerian Lecture, P.A.M. Dirac discusses the physical interpretation of quantum mechanics and its challenges when extended to a relativistic framework. He highlights the principles of superposition and indeterminacy, and explores the mathematical formalism and its difficulties in aligning with the restricted principle of relativity.
