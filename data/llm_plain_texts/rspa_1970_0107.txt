tldr: The authors investigated the absorption of oxygen in silicon in the near and far infrared regions. They confirmed the origin of the 1136 band and disagreed with earlier assignments of the 517 and 1203 bands. The study also revealed additional absorption lines in the far infrared region, which were assigned to the bending mode of oxygen in silicon. The findings are relevant to organosiloxanes and provide insights into the properties of oxygen in silicon.
