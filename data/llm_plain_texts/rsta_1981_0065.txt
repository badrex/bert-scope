tldr: This article examines the geochemistry and timing of marginal basin and arc magmatism in the Philippine Sea. It identifies three periods of back-arc crustal generation and three pulses of volcanic activity along the associated island arcs. The geochemistry of basalts from the back-arc basins indicates that they are similar to mid-ocean ridge basalts, while the island arc rocks have variable compositions. The study provides important constraints on models of magmatism and extensional tectonics at convergent plate boundaries.
