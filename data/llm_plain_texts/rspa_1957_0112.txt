tldr: The authors developed an apparatus to measure the velocity of ultrasonic vibrations through molten electrolytes, such as alkali halides and nitrates, at high temperatures. They found that the compressibilities and free volumes of these liquids depend on the size of the particles and the temperature. The study led to a satisfactory equation of state and a proposed model for the ionic liquid, which agreed well with experimental data.
