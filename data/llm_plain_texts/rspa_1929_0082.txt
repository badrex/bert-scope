tldr: The authors conducted experiments on potassium vapour to study ionization and dissociation processes. They found that the majority of K2+ ions were formed by attachment rather than impact ionization. The authors also observed that high temperature and low voltage favored the dissociation process. The experiments provided insights into the collision and dissociation processes, as well as the momentum and angular momentum relations involved.
