tldr: The author, Peter Barlow, discusses the probable electric origin of all the phenomena of terrestrial magnetism. He explains how the discovery of Oersted revealed the relationship between electricity and magnetism, and how the effects of terrestrial magnetism can be imitated by distributing galvanic currents around the surface of an artificial globe. The Seebeck effect, which states that heat applied to a circuit of metallic conductors develops galvanism and gives rise to magnetic induction, further supports the idea that magnetism is a quality not essentially distinct from electricity.
