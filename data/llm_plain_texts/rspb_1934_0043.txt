tldr: This study investigates the impact of late premature beats on cardiac rhythm. The authors found that as the curtailed cycle shortens, the premature beat cycle lengthens, and there is a slight lengthening of the subsequent cycle. The disturbance of rhythm caused by late premature beats can lead to an altered phase of the cardiac rhythm, but the normal rhythm is eventually resumed. This research helps to understand the complex relationship between cardiac rhythm disturbances and the conduction system of the heart.
