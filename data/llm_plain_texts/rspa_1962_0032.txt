tldr: The authors investigated the isotope effect in radiation chemistry by comparing the yields of primary products in deuterium oxide (D2O) and ordinary water (H2O) when exposed to polonium alpha-particles and tritium beta-particles. They found that the isotope effect increases with higher energy radiation and that the distribution of deuterium atoms in D2O is more widespread than hydrogen atoms in water, leading to differences in radical and molecular yields.
