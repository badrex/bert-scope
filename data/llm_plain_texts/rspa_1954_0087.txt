tldr: The authors measured the vibration-rotation bands of methyl fluoride using a lead telluride photoconductive cell in a grating spectrometer. They analyzed three parallel bands and a perpendicular band, providing values for the rotational constants in the ground state. This study offers the first complete analysis of a perpendicular band in a symmetrical top molecule, contributing to the understanding of vibrational interactions in polyatomic molecules.
