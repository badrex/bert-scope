tldr: This article discusses the palaeomagnetic data from Precambrian and Early Palaeozoic rocks of Australia, focusing on the apparent polar wander path and its implications for global tectonics. The study reveals rapid polar motion between 750 and 400 million years ago and suggests that Gondwanaland was a unified landmass at least as far back as 750 million years ago. The findings support the view that Precambrian orogenic belts were of ensialic origin.
