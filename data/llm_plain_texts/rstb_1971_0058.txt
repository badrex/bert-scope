tldr: The study examines the morphological aspects of exocytosis in the adrenal medulla, specifically in hamster chromaffin cells. The researchers observed exocytosis profiles on all surfaces of the cells, near extracellular spaces and intercellular clefts. They also found differences in expelled granules' electron density between adrenaline and noradrenaline cells. The presence of bristle-coated pits associated with exocytosis suggests a role in cellular uptake of proteins.
