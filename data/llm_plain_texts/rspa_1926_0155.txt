tldr: The authors conducted experiments using a modified Robinson-Rawlinson apparatus to study the secondary and tertiary cathode rays produced by external and internal absorption of homogeneous X-rays. They used molybdenum K rays as primary X-radiation and observed the energies of the secondary cathode rays using the relativity formula. The results provide insights into the behavior of cathode rays and the atomic structure of elements.
