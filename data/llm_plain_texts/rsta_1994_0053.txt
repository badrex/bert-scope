tldr: This study investigates an impacting system and compares its dynamical behavior with a simple model system. The experiments demonstrate that the chaotic attractors exhibit certain geometric features, which are also present in more complex models. These features provide a diagnostic tool for impact studies, showing the influence of low-velocity impacts on chaotic dynamics.
