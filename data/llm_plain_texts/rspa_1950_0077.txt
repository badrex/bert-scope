tldr: This article investigates the electrical conductivity of thin wires, focusing on inelastic scattering and improved approximate methods. The authors develop a rigorous theory based on the electron theory of metals and improve previous theories by Lovell and Andrew. They also consider the Wiedemann-Franz law and its implications for thin specimens.
