tldr: The author investigates the alleged transmission of acquired characters, specifically focusing on the Brown-Sequard phenomenon in guinea pigs. They examine the experiments and findings of various researchers, including Brown-Sequard, and conclude that there is insufficient evidence to support the transmission of acquired characteristics through generations. The study highlights the importance of further research and critical analysis in understanding the mechanisms of inheritance and evolution.
