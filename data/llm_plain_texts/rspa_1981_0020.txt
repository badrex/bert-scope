tldr: The article discusses the use of nuclear-track analysis in meteoritic crystals to interpret and determine various phenomena and parameters related to meteorites. By examining latent and long-lived tracks in meteorites, researchers can decode their radiation and thermal histories, providing valuable information about the history of meteorites and the conditions in the Solar System. The study focuses on fission-track retention ages, cooling rates of meteoritic parent bodies, and the determination of pre-atmospheric sizes of meteorites.
