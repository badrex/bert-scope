tldr: The author presents a comprehensive method for the numerical solution of rectangular plate problems under various loadings and boundary conditions. The method involves obtaining a particular integral as a double Fourier sine series and summing it to a highly convergent single series. This approach is suitable for programming on an electronic computer and can be applied to various types of loads, including concentrated and distributed loads.
