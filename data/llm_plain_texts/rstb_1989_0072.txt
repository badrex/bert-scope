tldr: The article presents a new method for analyzing and comparing cleavage patterns in embryos using topological maps. The method, which is based on partitioning a sphere into polygons, allows for the identification of similarities and differences between cleavage patterns in various species. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by applying it to embryos of Nereis, Styela, and Xenopus, and suggest that cleavage patterns may have a mechanically stable form that preserves spatial information in the cytoplasm.
