tldr: The authors conducted experiments on cats to study the effects of hemisection of the spinal cord on movement, sensation, and reflexes. They found that hemisection led to immediate paralysis below and on the same side as the lesion, followed by gradual recovery. Sensation was always affected on the side of the lesion, with painful sensations felt on both sides but localized less precisely on the injured side. Reflexes were generally exaggerated below and on the same side as the lesion. The study aimed to understand the nature and origin of epileptiform convulsions and the paths in the spinal cord for afferent and efferent impulses.
