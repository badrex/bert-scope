tldr: The author, William Crookes, describes various experiments and apparatus used to study the effects of attraction and repulsion resulting from radiation. He discusses the action of heat and cold on suspended objects and the behavior of torsion balances in different environments. Crookes also explores the effects of different substances and gases on the apparatus and the role of various types of radiation in producing these phenomena.
