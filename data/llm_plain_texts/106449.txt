tldr: The author compares scoria from iron works to vitrified filaments described by Sir William Hamilton, who observed similar formations during volcanic eruptions. The author suggests that similar processes might occur in both cases, with wind and heat from iron furnaces drawing out the filaments, just as in volcanic eruptions. The author presents a specimen for the Royal Society's inspection.
