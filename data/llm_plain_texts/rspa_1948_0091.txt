tldr: This study investigates solar tides and their effects on the ionosphere, focusing on the diurnal magnetic variations. The research finds that the solar tide causes vertical ionic drift, leading to small disturbances in the ionosphere. The findings suggest that the currents producing the solar and lunar diurnal magnetic variations originate from specific regions in the ionosphere.
