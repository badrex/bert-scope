tldr: The author conducted experiments with electrical discharges in a Torricellian vacuum and observed the phenomenon of stratifications and dark bands. They discovered that the intensity of the light and the appearance of the bands depend on the energy of the battery and the nature of the metals used. The author also found that the negative terminal of the discharge gets heated and fused, while the positive terminal gets heated by the discharge in a vacuum.
