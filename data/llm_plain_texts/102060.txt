tldr: The author, Tankred Robinson, observed and described the design and construction of the Pont St. Esprit Bridge in France. The bridge, built by the Romans, has a unique and crooked design, with wide arches and uneven angles. Robinson discusses the potential use of this design in building bridges in Yorkshire, where streams are often torrents with rocky bottoms, making pile driving difficult.
