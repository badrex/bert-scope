tldr: The authors explore the process of internal conversion of beta-rays, where a beta-ray emitted from a radioactive atom's nucleus can be absorbed by an outer electron, resulting in the production of an electron and a positron. They provide a rigorous calculation of the matrix elements involved and discuss the experimental data related to this phenomenon.
