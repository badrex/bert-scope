tldr: The authors investigated how the tuning of human photopigments, specifically the L and M cones, may minimize red-green chromatic signals in natural conditions. They found that the naturally occurring L and M cone peaks may be set at a pair of points on the spectrum that, on average, minimizes the red-green chromatic signal. This observation supports the idea that red-green vision has evolved for a specific task, such as finding fruit, while minimizing interference by the chromatic signal in luminance vision.
