tldr: 'The study investigates the effects of Echis carinatus venom on various animals and its lethal dose. The venom causes local and distal hemorrhages, weakens the heart's contractions, and alters the quality of the blood. The lethal dose varies among different animals, with the most significant effects being blood changes and intravascular clotting. No direct action on the brain or spinal cord was observed.'
