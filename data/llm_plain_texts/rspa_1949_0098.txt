tldr: This study investigates the vapour pressures and rates of evaporation of straight-chain paraffin hydrocarbons. The researchers determined the physical constants, such as refractive index, density, and latent heats of vaporization and fusion, for these hydrocarbons. They used the Knudsen method to measure the vapour pressures and found that the rates of evaporation of drops and solid beads agreed with the previously published theory. The results provide insights into the size and shape of hydrocarbon molecules and have implications for further studies on branched-chain paraffin hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon mixtures.
