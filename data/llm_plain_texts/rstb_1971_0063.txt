tldr: This study examines the fine structure of noradrenaline storage vesicles in nerve terminals of the rat vas deferens. It identifies three types of vesicles: small dense-cored, large dense-cored, and flattened or elongated vesicles. The study discusses the possible functional implications of these vesicles' ultrastructural appearances and their role in noradrenaline storage and release in nerve terminals.
