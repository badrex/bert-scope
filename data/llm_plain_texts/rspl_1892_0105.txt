tldr: The author investigates the properties of numbers, particularly focusing on generators and complex moduli. They also explore the mathematical relationships between these concepts and their applications in real-world scenarios, such as transformers and electromagnetic induction. The work is presented in a series of propositions, with numerous examples to illustrate the concepts and maintain their arithmetical meaning.
