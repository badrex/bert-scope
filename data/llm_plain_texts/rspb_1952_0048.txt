tldr: Researchers used ultracentrifugation to study the infective and complement-fixing components in the virus system of foot-and-mouth disease. They found that the infective particle has a sedimentation constant of 70 Svedberg units and is associated with 50% of the initial complement-fixing activity. The remaining activity is associated with a slower sedimenting component with a sedimentation constant of 8 Svedberg units. This study helped establish a direct method for determining the partition of biological activities between components of a virus system.
