tldr: The author compares the intramolecular rearrangements promoted by transposons Tn5 and Tn10 in bacteria. They find that Tn5 promotes formation of adjacent deletions, deletions/inversions, and cointegrates, suggesting a replicative mechanism, while Tn10 promotes formation of adjacent deletions, deletions/inversions, and simple IS7 insertions, consistent with a conservative mechanism.
