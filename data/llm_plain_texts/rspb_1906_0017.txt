tldr: The authors investigate the development of the hepatomonas parasite responsible for Kala-Azar and cachexial fever. They discover a new stage in the parasite's life cycle and propose the stomach of blood-sucking insects as the natural place for its development. The study provides insights into the disease's transmission and potential prevention methods.
