tldr: The authors studied the formation of complex oxidation and condensation products of phenols, focusing on rearrangements of oxidation-reduction type in the diquinone group. They investigated the chemical properties and reactions of methoxyquinone and toluquinone, and discussed the mechanisms of oxidative coupling of phenols and quinones. The study provides insights into the formation of various phenolic compounds and their derivatives.
