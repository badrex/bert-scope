tldr: This article explores Heisenberg's S-matrix theory for a system of many particles, focusing on the properties of a many-particle system and the energy levels of bound states. The author demonstrates the extension of this theory to include singular eigenstates describing the scattering of one particle on a compound center made up of the other particle bound to the scatterer.
