tldr: The authors develop an approximate upper bound approach to analyze the growth of an elliptical void in a finite unit cell undergoing simple shearing combined with hydrostatic tension. The matrix material is assumed to be an incompressible nonlinear power-law viscous solid. The study provides relations between stress triaxiality, void growth rate, void volume fraction, void aspect ratio, and strain rate sensitivity exponent, offering insights into ductile failure mechanisms under shear deformation.
