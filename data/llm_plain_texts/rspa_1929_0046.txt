tldr: 'The authors analyze the pressure distribution in a fluid caused by the axial vibration of a rigid disc. They examine the effect of frequency and disc size on the pressure distribution and discuss the implications for sound reproduction in loudspeakers. The study provides insights into the design of loudspeakers to achieve better tonal balance and uniform pressure distribution.'
