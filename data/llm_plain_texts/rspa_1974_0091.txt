tldr: This study investigates the effect of uniaxial stress on the GR1 doublet in diamond. The authors demonstrate that the stress dependence of the energies of the GR1 lines can be understood by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian of the perturbed GR1 center, with good agreement between theory and experiment. The stress dependence of the intensities of the A to transition is also explained by the coupling of the ground states.
