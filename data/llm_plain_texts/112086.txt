tldr: The author's research on fetal liver and intestines demonstrates that digestion and absorption occur during fetal life, contrary to Harvey's belief. The liver is the source of the albuminous substance found in the intestines, and the placenta functions similarly to the combination of the chorion membrane, yolk, and white in adult life. This research also suggests that the liver's function continues to a great extent during adulthood.
