revised_title: 'Nitrogen Fixation in Legume Nodules: Carbon Substrates, Nitrogen Assimilation, and Metabolic Processes'
semantic_tags:
  - Nitrogen fixation
  - Legume nodules
  - Carbon substrate utilization
  - Nitrogen assimilation
  - Symbiotic association
tldr: This article discusses the processes related to nitrogen fixation in nodulated legumes, focusing on carbon substrate utilization provided by the host plant, assimilation of nitrogen by the host, and metabolic processes within the nodules. The importance of carbon substrates like C4 dicarboxylates in supporting nitrogenase activity is highlighted, as well as the role of the host legume in regulating nitrogen fixation. The article also touches upon the assimilation of fixed nitrogen, the glutamine synthetase-glutamate synthase cycle, and the regulation of nodule metabolism.
