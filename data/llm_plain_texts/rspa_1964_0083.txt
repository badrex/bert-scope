tldr: This study investigates the heat capacities and compressibilities of liquid piperidine, tetrahydropyran, and cyclohexane, as well as their binary mixtures. The authors found that molecular association, such as hydrogen bonding, significantly influences the thermodynamic properties of these systems. They also determined the temperature variation of the heats of mixing for the studied systems.
