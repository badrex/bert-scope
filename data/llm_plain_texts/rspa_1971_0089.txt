tldr: The authors develop a closed-form solution for the melting or solidification of a half-space under a general surface heat input. They use the embedding technique to show that the shape of the phase interface is a universal function, independent of the heat input distribution and material properties. The solution is useful for understanding the initial stages of melting and solidification processes in materials.
