tldr: The authors analyze the magnetic isotherms in the band model of ferromagnetism, focusing on the very weak itinerant ferromagnetism limit. They develop a simple formula for the magnetization and associated differential susceptibility, which is valid over a wide temperature range, including the Curie temperature. The theoretical results are applied to interpret recent isotherm measurements on a compound, showing good qualitative agreement but with some quantitative discrepancies.
