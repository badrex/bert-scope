tldr: This study investigates the role of the anterior hypothalamus in controlling gonadotrophin release in Japanese quail. The researchers found that lesions in the preoptic region of the hypothalamus blocked testicular growth, while deafferentation slightly more posterior or rostral to the preoptic area had no effect on gonadotrophin secretion. The results suggest a role for the anterior hypothalamus in the photoperiodic response.
