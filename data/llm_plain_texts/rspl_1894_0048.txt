tldr: The author investigates an anomaly in the density determinations of nitrogen gas and discusses the possible causes of the discrepancy between nitrogen prepared by Lupton's method and that derived from air. The author examines various methods of gas preparation and explores the influence of impurities and gas mixtures on the density of nitrogen gas.
