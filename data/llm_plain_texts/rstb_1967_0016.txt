tldr: This study investigates the terrestrial Antarctic ecosystem on Signy Island, focusing on the quantitative community analysis and bryophyte ecology. The research divides the vegetation into categories based on physiognomic criteria and floristic composition, supporting the classification system. The study also explores the ecological relationships of dominant species and their response to environmental factors, such as water supply, temperature, and soil conditions.
