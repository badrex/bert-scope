tldr: The author investigates the single-line spectra of magnesium, mercury, zinc, and cadmium to determine their ionizing potentials. They find that the ionizing potential can be calculated using the relation Ve = hv, where V is the potential fall and h is Planck's constant. The study confirms the ionizing potentials for these elements and provides a method for calculating ionizing potentials for other elements with single-line spectra.
