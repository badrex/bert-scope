tldr: John Hunter conducted experiments on the crystalline humor of the eye, suggesting that it has a muscular structure that allows the eye to adjust to different distances. He discovered a fibrous structure in the crystalline humor, which had been observed before by Leuwenhoek, but Hunter's contribution was to provide a detailed description of its structure and its potential role in the eye's ability to adjust focus.
