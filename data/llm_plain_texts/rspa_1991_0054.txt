tldr: The authors present a continuum damage mechanics model to analyze the high-temperature deformation and failure of a pipe weldment. They use a combination of experimental data and finite element analysis to predict the behavior of the weldment under multi-axial stress states. The study focuses on the materials used in power-generating plants and provides insights into the design and maintenance of pressurized pipes.
