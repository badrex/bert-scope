tldr: The author investigates the structure and mechanism of action of papain, a proteolytic enzyme found in papaya latex. Papain is a thiol-dependent enzyme that forms a cleft with seven subsites for binding amino acid residues in a peptide substrate. The author discusses the enzyme's activation, inactivation, and the role of the essential thiol group in its catalytic mechanism.
