tldr: The author discusses the advancements in understanding ocean currents and the importance of studying their dynamics. A mid-ocean experiment, known as m.o.d.e. 1, is proposed to investigate geostrophic eddies and their role in the general ocean circulation. This experiment will use various instruments and approaches to gather data for mapping and diagnosing the dynamics of these eddies.
