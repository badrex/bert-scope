tldr: 'This article examines memory disorders resulting from focal neocortical damage, focusing on selective impairments involving specific categories of stimuli or mnestic abilities. It also explores the relationship between the hemisphere side of the lesion and memory of non-verbal visual material. The study highlights the importance of discrete cortical areas in engram storage and the impact of focalized brain lesions on memory functions.'
