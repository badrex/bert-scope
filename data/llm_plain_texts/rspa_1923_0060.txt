tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the spectra of elements in the aluminium sub-group (aluminium, gallium, indium, and thallium). They found that the normal state of the atoms in this group corresponds to an l7r orbit, not a l<r orbit as previously thought. This discovery aligns with the latest developments of Bohr's theory.
