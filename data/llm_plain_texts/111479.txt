tldr: The author, A. Claudet, invented a new instrument called the Stereomonoscope, which creates a stereoscopic illusion using a single picture. The Stereomonoscope works by using two lenses and a ground glass to refract and combine images from a slide, creating an illusion of relief similar to natural vision. This instrument challenges the traditional understanding of the camera obscura and offers a new perspective in the field of optics.
