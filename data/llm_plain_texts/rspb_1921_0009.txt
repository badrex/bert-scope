tldr: The author conducted experiments on a spinal cat to compare the reflex contraction of a muscle evoked by a single induction shock with the contraction evoked when the same stimulus is applied directly to the muscle's motor nerve. They found that reflex contractions were generally longer in duration, had a later tension crest, and had a different steepness of ascent compared to neuromyal twitch contractions. The author also discovered that a single break-shock stimulus could evoke a succession of contraction waves in some muscle fibers, suggesting a possible role for proprioceptive reflexes in the reflex contraction.
