tldr: The article is a biography of James Franck, a pioneering physicist who made significant contributions to the field of atomic physics. Franck worked with Gustav Hertz to study the kinetics of electrons and ions, leading to the discovery of excitation potentials and the quantized energy transfer from kinetic to light energy. Their experiments provided a new method of measuring Planck's constant and supported the reality of energy quanta, which was a crucial aspect of quantum theory. Franck's work had a profound impact on the development of atomic physics and quantum mechanics.
