tldr: The author discovered tubular and vesicular structures in the spermatic cord, which he named "Corps Innomine." These structures are remnants of the Wolffian body from the embryo and can be found in both males and females. The author explains their location, appearance, and function, as well as their potential connection to cysts in the spermatic cord. The paper includes illustrations of these structures in their natural state and under the microscope.
