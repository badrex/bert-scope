tldr: This study investigates the enzymes and decay mechanisms of eight wood-rotting polypore fungi species. The researchers found that these fungi produce different enzymes that break down cellulose and lignin, causing various types of decay in wood. The study also examines the cultural characteristics, fruit production, and pH changes in the growth medium of these fungi.
