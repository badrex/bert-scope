tldr: The author discusses how interferon, initially known as an antiviral substance, can also inhibit tumor growth in experimental animals and patients with benign and malignant tumors. Interferon may act directly on tumor cells or indirectly via the host, and its effects on tumor growth are multifaceted. The author reviews the development of the concept of interferon's diverse biological effects and its potential applications in cancer treatment.
