tldr: The authors present a numerical solution for the trailing edge flow problem, focusing on the triple-deck structure. They discuss the mathematical problem, boundary conditions, and provide relevant formulas for comparison with the numerical solution. The study aims to resolve the discontinuity in transverse velocity and pressure gradient near the trailing edge of an airfoil, contributing to a better understanding of the flow dynamics in this region.
