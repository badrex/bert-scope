tldr: The author, Dr. Andrew Ure, discusses the limitations of previous methods for analyzing organic substances and introduces new methods to improve accuracy. He uses oxide of copper in a specific humidity and dries organic bodies in a vacuum with a surface of sulfuric acid. He also describes a furnace and other implements for decomposition and examines the results of his analyses, including the composition of sulfuric ether and diabetic sugar.
