tldr: The authors study the role of peroxidases, radical cations, and oxygen in the degradation of lignin. They find that ligninase, an extracellular peroxidase produced by white-rot fungi, can oxidize methoxylated substrates to radical cation intermediates, which can break C-H or C-C bonds. This process is essential for the oxidation of veratryl alcohol and the degradation of lignin model compounds. The authors propose that oxygen binds to these radicals, generating active oxygen species, which could lead to lignin auto-oxidation at a distance from the enzyme.
