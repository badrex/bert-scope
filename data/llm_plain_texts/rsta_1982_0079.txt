tldr: This article presents a normal vector model to study the geomagnetic secular variation during the Late Tertiary period. The model considers the Earth's core structure, evolution, and magnetic field, and it helps to understand the distribution of the dipole and non-dipole field vectors. The findings can be useful for estimating the Earth's core dynamics and the history of its magnetic field.
