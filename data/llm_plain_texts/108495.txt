tldr: The author explores a class of differential equations, including those that occur in dynamical problems, and demonstrates how to find the remaining integrals of the system using the concept of "normal elements" and "principal functions." This work contributes to the understanding of Hamiltonian mechanics and the application of Jacobi's theorem.
