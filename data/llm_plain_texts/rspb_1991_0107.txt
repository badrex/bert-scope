tldr: 'Homing pigeons were found to home faster when they could view the local landscape at familiar release sites before release. This suggests that pigeons may use visual information when available, and that viewing familiar landscapes could play a role in pigeon homing. Further research is needed to determine the precise nature of the visual inputs and how they affect orientation.'
