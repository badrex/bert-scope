tldr: This study investigates the development of the labyrinth of the lamprey (Lampetra fluviatilis) on three levels: gross morphology, hair cell orientation within sensory areas, and subcellular development of sensory cells. The findings reveal unique developmental processes and provide insights into the functioning of the mature lamprey labyrinth, comparing its development to that of gnathostomes.
