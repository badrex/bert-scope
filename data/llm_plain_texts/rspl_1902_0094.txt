tldr: The author investigates the bending of electric waves, including light waves, around a perfectly conducting obstacle. They find that when the wave-length is small compared to the obstacle's size, there is no true shadow near the surface. The study also reveals that the condition for the formation of a distinct shadow near the surface of a convex conducting body is when there is a line on that part of the surface inside the geometrical shadow where the radius of curvature is small compared to the wave-length.
