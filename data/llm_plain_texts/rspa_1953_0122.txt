tldr: The article discusses recent laboratory measurements on the motions of slow electrons in air, suggesting alternative developments in the theory of radio wave interaction. The existing theory, based on the relationship between the collisional frequency and power supplied by the disturbing wave, is questioned, and a new formulation is presented. This new approach predicts the same formal dependence of the absorption coefficient on the parameters but with different values, leading to inconsistencies between laboratory and ionospheric behavior.
