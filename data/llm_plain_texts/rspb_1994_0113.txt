tldr: The study investigates the spatial correlation of suppressive and excitatory receptive fields with direction selectivity in complex cells of cat striate cortex. The researchers found that direction selectivity can be explained by a positional mismatch between excitatory and suppressive influences on each neuron, with the suppressive receptive field ahead of the excitatory receptive field for stimuli moving in the non-preferred direction. This mismatch may provide the basis for direction selectivity and the emergence of null suppression.
