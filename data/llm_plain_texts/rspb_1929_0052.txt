tldr: The authors studied the properties of monomolecular surface films of various sterols, including cholesterol, ergosterol, and sitosterol. They found that the structure and stability of these films depend on the position and nature of the water-attracting groups in the sterol molecules. The study also revealed that changes in molecular tilt can significantly affect the properties of the surface films.
