tldr: 'This article explores the phenomenon of patchiness in marine and terrestrial systems, focusing on how individuals respond to their environments and how these responses contribute to the development of aggregations and non-uniform patterns of distribution. The authors discuss the importance of understanding individual responses to patchiness and how they lead to diverse ecological and evolutionary outcomes. They also examine the role of physical environment heterogeneity and organismal adaptations in shaping patchiness and its effects on species distribution and coexistence.'
