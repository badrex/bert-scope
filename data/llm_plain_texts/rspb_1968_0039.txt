tldr: The authors conducted a detailed examination of the lipids in Rhodopseudomonas spheroides, a photosynthetic microorganism. They found that the major lipids in the organism are phospholipids, consisting of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, and phosphatidylcholine. Additionally, they discovered a sulpholipid and a new lipid containing ornithine. The study concluded that there is no specific lipid associated with chromatophores in the organism.
