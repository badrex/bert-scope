tldr: The authors investigated the addition of methyl radicals to isolated, conjugated, and cumulated dienes. They found that isolated dienes behave like mono-olefins, while conjugated dienes exhibit high reactivity due to resonance stabilization. Methyl substituents affect reactivity through hyperconjugation and steric 'blocking' effects. The reactivity of cumulated dienes is extremely low, with a low A factor contributing to their low reactivity.
