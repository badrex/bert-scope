tldr: The author investigates the slow combustion of various aromatic and alicyclic hydrocarbons, including benzene, toluene, and their derivatives. They find that chain mechanisms are involved in the combustion process, with different hydrocarbons showing distinct characteristics. The study also examines the influence of concentration factors, temperature, and surface effects on the combustion rates and product compositions. The energy of activation and the dependence of reaction velocity on concentration factors are determined for each hydrocarbon.
