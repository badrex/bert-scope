tldr: The authors develop a numerical algorithm using repeated diagonalization techniques to estimate the Titchmarsh-Weyl coefficient in the second-order differential equation. This algorithm is effective for small values of the integer and functions with large negative real parts as the solutions of the equation are highly oscillatory.
