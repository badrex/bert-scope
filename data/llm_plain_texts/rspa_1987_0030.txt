tldr: The article discusses the concept of valid randomization in experimental designs, focusing on combinatorial structures and sufficient conditions for weak and strong validity. It explores different types of valid randomization schemes, such as complete block designs, resolvable incomplete block designs, and other block structures. The article also highlights the importance of characterizing structures with a valid randomization theory and the challenges in doing so.
