tldr: The authors investigated the effects of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) on glial cells in the octopus brain. They found that after administering 6-OHDA, glial cells in the median frontal and superior buccal lobes showed degenerative changes, while no changes were observed in neuronal cells. This study provides insights into the specificity of 6-OHDA's action in an invertebrate model.
