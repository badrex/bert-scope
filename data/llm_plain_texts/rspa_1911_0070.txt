tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate Gibbs' equation and capillary adsorption at the air-water interface using nonylic acid as the test substance. They found that the concentration of the substance at the interface was significantly higher than in the bulk solution, and the surface tension decreased with increasing concentration. The results provide insights into the behavior of substances at the interface of different phases and the role of surface concentration in various phenomena.
