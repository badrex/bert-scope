tldr: The authors present a formally convergent method for calculating the thermodynamic properties of solutions using the cluster-integral approach of the theory of imperfect gases. They introduce the concept of a reference fluid and express the difference between the free energy of the solution and the reference fluid in terms of cluster integrals containing the distribution functions of the reference fluid. This approach provides a unified and formally exact basis for existing approximate theories of solutions and a method for obtaining more accurate results.
