  - Pendulum Motion
  - Viscous Forces
tldr: The author discusses the concept of kinetic stability in rotating systems, presenting examples of rotating particles, pendulums, and fluid masses. They explore the differences between ordinary and permanent stability, considering the effects of friction and viscous forces on the systems' behavior.
