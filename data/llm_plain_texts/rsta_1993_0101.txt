tldr: The authors describe a new concept for synthesizing GaAs quantum wire and dot structures in an AlAs matrix using molecular beam epitaxy. They exploit the evolution of surface and interface structures on non-(100)-oriented GaAs substrates during epitaxy to create periodic arrays of macrosteps and facets, which form symmetric and asymmetric quantum-dot and wire arrays. The existence of lateral quantum-size effects in these structures is confirmed by reflection high-energy electron diffraction, atomic force microscopy, high-resolution electron microscopy, and distinct electronic properties.
