tldr: This article investigates the relationship between the viscosity and chemical nature of liquids, focusing on esters and ethers. The authors found that both ethers and esters show no evidence of molecular aggregation and follow certain rules regarding molecular weight, isomers, and symmetry. They also discovered that ether-oxygen has a different effect on viscosity compared to hydroxyl-oxygen and carbonyl-oxygen.
