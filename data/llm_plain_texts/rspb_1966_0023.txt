tldr: The author investigates the genetic organization in higher organisms, focusing on the rosy locus in Drosophila melanogaster. They identify a single cistron responsible for xanthine dehydrogenase enzyme activity and eye pigment production. The study provides insights into understanding gene organization and function in higher organisms, using the microbial model as a reference.
