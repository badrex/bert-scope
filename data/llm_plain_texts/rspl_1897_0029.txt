tldr: The authors explain the flight of boomerangs and the condensation of aqueous vapour through theoretical equations and experiments. They found that the direction of the boomerang's axis of rotation depends on its angular velocities, and the discrepancies in the theoretical results are not larger than expected. The study also provides an explanation for the returning and non-returning boomerang flights, as well as the long, straight trajectories of some native implements. Additionally, they discuss the critical expansion of air and other gases, leading to condensation in the form of drops throughout the moist air.
