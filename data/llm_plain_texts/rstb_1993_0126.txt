tldr: The authors discovered five types of colloblasts in the ctenophore Minictena luteola, which differ in size and structure. They studied the colloblasts at different stages of differentiation using electron microscopy, leading to a better understanding of the axial filament, spheroidal body, and their relationship with the nucleus. This research questions the axonemal nature of the spiral filament and provides insights into the function and organization of colloblasts in ctenophores.
