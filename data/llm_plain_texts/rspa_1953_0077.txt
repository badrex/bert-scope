tldr: This study investigates the vapor pressure and evaporation rates of potassium chloride, providing a theoretical and experimental analysis. The authors use the Debye theory to explain the evaporation process and consider the role of a mobile surface layer in the rate of evaporation. The results support the theory and provide insights into the factors affecting evaporation rates in ionic solids.
