tldr: The study examines the effect of increased hydrostatic pressure on the tension developed in glycerinated rabbit muscle fibers. It found that increasing pressure caused a reversible depression of isometric tension when the fiber was maximally calcium-activated or in rigor, with a 15% depression for active tension and 30% for rigor tension for an increase of pressure of 10 MPa. This research provides insights into the molecular events in the cross-bridge cycle of muscle contraction.
