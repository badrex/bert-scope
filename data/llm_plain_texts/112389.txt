tldr: This paper discusses the fossil teeth of extinct equine species found in Central and South America. The author, Professor Owen, describes and analyzes the teeth of three species: Equus conversidens, Equus tau, and Equus arcidens. He compares these species to existing horses and other extinct animals, suggesting that they may have formed a distinct group within the Equidae family. The paper includes illustrations of the specimens described.
