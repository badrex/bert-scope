tldr: The authors conducted experiments on a motored compression-ignition engine to study the blue flames in the auto-ignition of methane. They found that a blue pre-ignition glow occurs with weak methane mixtures, and analyzed the exhaust products, pressure, and luminosity. The spectrum of the glow showed formaldehyde bands, which are associated with cool flames. The results suggest that low-temperature oxidation processes may contribute to engine knock in methane combustion.
