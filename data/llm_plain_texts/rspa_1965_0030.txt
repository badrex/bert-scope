tldr: The authors studied the electronic spectrum of nitrosomethane and found that the complex spectrum is due to torsional motion. They analyzed the vibrational and torsional frequencies and estimated the changes in the molecule's equilibrium geometry upon electronic excitation. The study provides insights into the molecular structure and behavior of nitrosomethane.
