tldr: The author presents a summary of his previous observations on the properties of the Dionoea leaf in the excited and unexcited state. He concludes that the property that makes the leaf respond to stimulation is similar to that found in animal structures. The main purpose of his subsequent investigations is to determine the relationship between the resting current and the action of the leaf.
