tldr: This article explores the role of Hox and Pax gene products in controlling the expression of the neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) during development. The authors found that these transcription factors bind to specific DNA sequences in the N-CAM promoter, activating it and influencing cell adhesion and tissue patterning. This connection between gene products and pattern-forming genes highlights the importance of understanding how these factors regulate tissue architecture during development.
