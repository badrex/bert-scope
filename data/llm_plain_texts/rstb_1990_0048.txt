tldr: The article investigates the role of interleukin-3 (IL-3) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) in the differentiation of lymphocytes, specifically focusing on B-cell development. The researchers found that an IL-3-dependent precursor B-cell line, LyD9, can differentiate into mature B cells and myeloid cells when co-cultured with bone marrow stromal cells. Additionally, an IL-4-dependent clone, K-4, was established, which serves as an intermediate in the differentiation process from LyD9 to B cells and myeloid cells.
