tldr: This article discusses an experiment conducted to study the difference in potential at the surface of the ground above and near a buried metal charge from a high-pressure electric light supply. The authors found that a significant potential difference could be established, which could potentially cause electrical accidents. The experiment also observed the effect of soil moisture and the presence of worms on the potential difference.
