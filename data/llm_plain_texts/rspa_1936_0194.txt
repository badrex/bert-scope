tldr: This article presents experiments on the effect of pressure on natural convection in air. The authors found that natural convection is proportional to the slope of a curve in dimensionless coordinates, and it appears to have a minimum and maximum value at specific points. The results show that natural convection is not significantly affected by increasing pressure up to 1000 atmospheres.
