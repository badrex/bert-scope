tldr: Researchers monitored the development of infant color vision by measuring chromatic contrast sensitivity and acuity in eight young infants over six months. They found that both contrast sensitivity and acuity for chromatic stimuli increased steadily, more rapidly than for luminance stimuli. The difference in the rate of development of luminance and chromatic contrast sensitivity and acuity probably reflects the neural development of the infant color system.
