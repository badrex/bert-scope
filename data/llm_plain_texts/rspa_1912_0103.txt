tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the similarity in nature of X- and primary beta-rays. They discovered that the more "soft" the beta-rays, the more their properties, including absorption and scattering, approach those of X-rays. The primary beta-rays of radium E were found to excite characteristic X-radiations of silver, tin, and other metals, further supporting the similarity between the two types of radiation.
