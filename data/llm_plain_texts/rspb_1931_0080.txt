tldr: The authors discovered that certain potato virus diseases, part of the mosaic group, are composed of multiple viruses. They developed a technique using plant indicators and selective transmission methods to isolate and study these viruses separately. This research helps in understanding the complexity of potato virus diseases and provides a basis for future classification and study of plant viruses.
