tldr: 'C. W. Siemens discovered that it is possible to convert mechanical force into electrical force without the need for permanent magnetism. He demonstrated this through an experiment using an electromagnetic machine with a rotating keeper. This finding showed that powerful electrical effects could be produced without relying on steel magnets, which can lose their magnetism during use.'
