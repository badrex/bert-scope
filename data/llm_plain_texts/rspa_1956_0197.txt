tldr: This article investigates the impact of dust particles on the contact between solids, focusing on the behavior of surfaces contaminated with particulate matter. The authors develop a simple physical model to explain how the probability of direct contact between surfaces is affected by the number and size of contaminating particles, load between the solids, and the nature of the contacting surfaces. The experimental results are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions, indicating that increasing surface roughness can help prevent the effectiveness of contamination in preventing direct contact.
