tldr: This article presents an extensive series of experiments aimed at determining the material functions for viscometric flows of a given polymer solution. The experiments were conducted on various instruments and by different experimenters to isolate discrepancies and sources of error. The results provide a detailed and comprehensive set of measurements for the rheological properties of the fluid, contributing to the understanding of non-Newtonian fluids.
