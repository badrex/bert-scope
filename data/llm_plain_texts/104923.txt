tldr: The author, Mons. Daviel, discusses the treatment of cancer in the eye-lids, nose, and surrounding areas, which was previously considered incurable. He argues that cancer is treatable and shares his experience with successful surgeries. Daviel emphasizes the importance of removing the cancer entirely, including the periosteum and perichondrium, to ensure a thorough cure. He also shares two case studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of his surgical methods.
