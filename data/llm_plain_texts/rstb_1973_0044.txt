tldr: This study investigates temperature regulation in Yemenite and Kurdish Jews living in Israel, focusing on the differences between the two ethnic groups and the effects of seasonal variations. The research found no significant differences in thermoregulatory function between the two groups, but did reveal that women of both ethnicities had lower sweat rates, stored more heat before sweating, and had higher skin temperatures at sweat onset compared to men. The study also showed that both males and females sweated less in the winter than in the summer, with the level of heat acclimatization in the Israeli subjects being significantly lower than that of European controls tested in cooler climates.
