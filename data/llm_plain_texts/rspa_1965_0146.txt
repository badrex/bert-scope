revised_title: 'Critique of Hoyle-Narlikar Theory of Gravitation'

tldr: The authors analyze the Hoyle-Narlikar theory of gravitation, derived from a direct-particle action principle, and show that it is incompatible with an expanding universe. They argue that the advanced field would be infinite, and suggest that allowing negative mass might be a way to overcome this difficulty. However, they also note that introducing negative masses would likely raise more problems than it would solve.
