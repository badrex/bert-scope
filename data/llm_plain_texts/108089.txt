tldr: The author, Thomas Graham, investigates the constitution of various salts, including oxalates, nitrates, phosphates, sulphates, and chlorides. He examines the properties and compositions of these salts, focusing on their water content and the way they interact with other substances. His findings contribute to a better understanding of the chemistry of these compounds and their potential applications.
