tldr: The authors study the vibrations of an atom of different mass in a cubic crystal using the Green function method of Lifshitz. They find that localized modes appear with frequencies above the range of the unperturbed modes for light masses, while heavy masses have resonant frequencies near which these modes are considerably affected. The results are evaluated for a Debye spectrum of lattice modes, and the mean-square amplitude and velocity of the defect atom are computed at various temperatures.
