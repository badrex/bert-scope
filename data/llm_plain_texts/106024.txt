tldr: 'M. de Stehlin reports on the discovery of a large mass of native iron in Siberia by academician PALLAS. The iron is soft, flexible, and can be shaped into tools. It is found in a region with no evidence of previous ironworking, suggesting it may have been formed by natural processes. The existence of native iron, previously doubted, is now considered established.'
