tldr: Researchers successfully crystallized chlorocruorin, a respiratory pigment closely related to hemoglobin, from the blood of certain polychaete worms. They analyzed the absorption spectrum of the crystals and compared its composition to that of hemoglobin, finding differences in iron and sulfur content. This study provides insight into the molecular structure and function of chlorocruorin.
