tldr: The authors conducted experiments on giant trophoblast cells of the mouse, analyzing the effects of actinomycin D treatment. They found that the treatment caused the nuclear contents to condense, revealing chromosome-like structures. The number of these structures in the nuclei was close to the diploid number of 40 chromosomes, indicating that they might represent chromosomes or parts of chromosomes. The results suggest that a considerable degree of polyteny is involved in the high DNA values found in giant trophoblast cells.
