tldr: A.W. Hofmann describes the discovery and synthesis of methylic aldehyde, a compound of interest due to its position in the monocarbon series and its potential for further study. He details a method for producing methylic aldehyde through the slow combustion of methylic alcohol and discusses its properties and reactions, including the formation of a crystalline derivative. Further research is proposed to isolate the compound in a pure state and better understand its properties.
