tldr: The authors discovered organic sediments beneath the Ilford brickearth, which is famous for its rich mammalian fauna. Pollen analysis shows that these organic sediments and the lower part of the overlying brickearth were deposited during the Ipswichian (Last) Interglacial. The pollen diagrams reveal the vegetational succession typical of the first half of the interglacial, with a climate warmer than present. The rich flora of macroscopic plant remains indicates that a climate with warmer summers prevailed in the area. The organic deposits were formed in a large pond or a small stream, tributary to the Thames at that time. The authors correlate the Ilford temperate deposits with other temperate fossiliferous deposits in the lower Thames valley.
