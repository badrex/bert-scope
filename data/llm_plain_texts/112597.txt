tldr: The author, Charles Chambers, discusses his work as the Acting Superintendent of the Bombay Magnetic Observatory. He shares the progress made in reducing the old observations and the results of the magnetic disturbances from 1845 to 1865. The study reveals a minimum in magnetic disturbances in early 1864 and a probable maximum in 1859, confirming the decennial period. Chambers also requests improvements for the observatory, such as magnetographs, a suitable room, and a team of computers to process the old observations.
