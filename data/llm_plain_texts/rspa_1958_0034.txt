tldr: The authors present a general derivation of the electron energy distribution function in a uniform electric field, considering both elastic and inelastic collisions with gas molecules. They use the Jeffreys method to solve the equilibrium equation for the electron population and derive an equation relating the Townsend ionization coefficient to the properties of the gas. The theory is illustrated with calculations for hydrogen, showing good agreement with experimental observations.
