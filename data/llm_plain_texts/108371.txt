tldr: 'Michael Faraday conducted experiments to study the electricity generated by the friction of water and steam against other bodies. He discovered that the excitation of electricity is independent of evaporation or change of state and is due to the friction of water particles carried by steam against surrounding solid matter. Faraday found that increasing pressure and the shape of the exciting passage significantly influence the evolution of electricity.'
