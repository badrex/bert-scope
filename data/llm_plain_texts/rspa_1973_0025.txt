tldr: This study investigates annular hydraulic jumps in a horizontal tube using a convergent-divergent nozzle. The experiments confirm the inviscid theory's predictions of the radial thickness of the stream and the Froude number. The results show that the stream's thickness remains constant, and the angle of the striations remains unchanged. The study also measures the radial thickness of the stream and compares it with theoretical values, finding a discrepancy that can be explained by the influence of the boundary layer on the wall and the effects of gravity.
