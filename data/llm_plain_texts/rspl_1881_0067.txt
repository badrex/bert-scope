tldr: The article discusses the production of transient electric currents in iron and steel conductors when subjected to torsion and magnetisation. The author, J. A. Ewing, and Professor H. C. Fleeming Jenkin, observed that twisting a magnetised iron or steel wire produced a current along its length. They also discovered that the effects of torsion and magnetisation could be explained by a state called "polarisation" in the wire, which persisted even when the magnetising force was removed. The phenomenon of hysteresis, which is the persistence of previous states due to molecular friction, was observed in the relationship between polarisation and torsion. The authors also found that the effects of hysteresis could be eliminated by subjecting the wire to mechanical vibration or by changing its magnetisation.
