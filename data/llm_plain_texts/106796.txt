tldr: The author, John Andrew de Luc, explains his theory of evaporation and steam formation. He states that an expansive fluid composed of water and fire is produced during evaporation. The author connects hygrometry with hygrology and demonstrates how the hygrometer and barometer are affected by evaporation in a closed vessel. He also discusses the role of pressure and temperature in the formation and decomposition of steam.
