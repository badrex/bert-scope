tldr: The study investigates the unique structure and function of the dorsal eye of male mayflies, focusing on their sensitivity to ultraviolet light. The researchers discovered that the dorsal eye acts as a light guide, allowing the mayfly to have a reduced facet size while maintaining good vision. The clear zone in the eye plays a crucial role in the light guide mechanism, and the eye's structure is essential for the mayfly to find a mate.
