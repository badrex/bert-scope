tldr: The author, John Theophilus Desaguliers, conducted experiments to prove that the force of moving bodies is proportional to their mass multiplied by their velocity, contrary to the opinion of some who believed the force was proportional to the square of the velocity. Desaguliers used various experiments and examples to demonstrate his findings, which supported the principles of classical mechanics and the work of Sir Isaac Newton.
