tldr: The authors conducted a detailed spectral analysis of the arc spectrum of arsenic, extending it to a wavelength of 1563 Angstroms. They identified new lines and combinations due to electron transitions from the deepest 4 state to higher 5s, 4p, and 4d states. The study provides a comprehensive classification of the arsenic arc spectrum and contributes to the understanding of atomic structure and spectral analysis.
