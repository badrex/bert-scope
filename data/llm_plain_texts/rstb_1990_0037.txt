tldr: 'This article discusses the various adaptations and resistance mechanisms that marine organisms exhibit to survive in low-temperature environments. These adaptations include the production of antifreeze proteins, changes in membrane properties, and capacity adaptations that increase the rate of some physiological processes. The article also highlights the differences in development rates and neuromuscular function between polar and temperate species.'
