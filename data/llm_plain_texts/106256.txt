tldr: The author conducted experiments with Edward Nairne's air pump on Mr. Smeaton's principle to measure the expansion of air. They used different types of barometers and found that the long barometer-gage was more accurate in determining the actual diminution of pressure. The experiments helped improve the understanding of air pressure and the development of barometers.
