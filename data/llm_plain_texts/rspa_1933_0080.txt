revised_title: 'Effect of Water Vapour on Diffusion Coefficients of Ions in Nitrogen and Oxygen'

  - Water vapor
  - Gas purity
tldr: The authors investigated the effect of water vapor on the diffusion coefficients of ions in nitrogen and oxygen. They found that oscillations previously observed in air were absent in nitrogen, while they reappeared in oxygen. The results support the idea that the oscillations in air are caused by the formation of ozone and oxides of nitrogen due to the action of alpha particles.
