tldr: This study investigates the use of a computer-aided system to assist in surgical diagnosis, specifically in patients with abdominal pain. The system uses a variant of Bayes Theorem to compare new cases with a database of 600 patients and produce a diagnostic prediction. The overall diagnostic accuracy of the computer-aided system was 91.5%, significantly higher than the clinicians' accuracy, and the system performed well in differentiating between common conditions like appendicitis and non-specific abdominal pain. The results suggest that computer-aided systems can be a valuable tool in improving diagnostic accuracy in surgical cases.
