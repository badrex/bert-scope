tldr: This article investigates air currents and acoustical phenomena in Kundt's tubes, which are responsible for the formation of dust figures. The author considers three problems related to these phenomena, including the currents generated over a vibrating plate, the color phenomena observed by Sedley Taylor on liquid films, and the air currents observed by Dvorak in a Kundt's tube. The study takes into account the compressibility of the fluid and the influence of friction on the motion of the fluid.
