tldr: The authors conducted a nuclear magnetic resonance investigation of three solid benzenes, measuring the absorption spectrum and spin-lattice relaxation time between 75 and 27 K. They found that the spectrum narrowed considerably at about 11 K, and developed a method to separate the intra- and intermolecular contributions to the second moment of the spectrum without needing to know the crystal structure. This study provided insights into the molecular structure and behavior of benzene in a solid state.
