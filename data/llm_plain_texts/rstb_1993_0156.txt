tldr: This article discusses the role of chitinase enzymes in plant defense mechanisms and how their expression can be enhanced in transgenic plants. The authors focus on the regulation of chitinase gene expression in response to ethylene treatment and the role of chitinase in plant defense against fungal pathogens. They also describe the production of transgenic plants with increased resistance to the fungal pathogen Rhizodoniasolani.
