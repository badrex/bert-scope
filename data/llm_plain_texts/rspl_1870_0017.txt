tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of red Bordeaux wine (claret) on a healthy man's body. They found that the wine increased the frequency of the man's heartbeats and caused mild emetic effects. The study also showed that the wine's influence on the body was more pronounced than that of pure alcohol.
