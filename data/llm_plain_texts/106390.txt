tldr: In this article, Patrick Wilson describes an extraordinary degree of cold experienced in Glasgow and conducts experiments to study the temperature of hoar-frost and the air near it. He observes that the air temperature at a higher elevation is warmer than at ground level and that hoar-frost has a significantly lower temperature than the surrounding air. This research contributes to the understanding of temperature variations and the effects of frost on the environment.
