tldr: The author presents a method for determining the velocities of saponification using electrical conductivity measurements. The method involves monitoring the change in conductivity of a solution containing caustic soda and an ester during the saponification process. The author demonstrates the method using the saponification of methyl acetate by caustic soda and discusses the advantages of this method over the titration method.
