tldr: The authors present a general theoretical solution for stress distributions in isotropic and aeolotropic plates containing various types of holes. The solution includes previously known results for isotropic materials and provides new results for both isotropic and aeolotropic plates. Numerical results are given for stress distributions around holes with different shapes, such as elliptical, rectangular, and square with rounded corners. The study focuses on stress systems that produce zero force resultants at the edge of the hole.
