tldr: This article investigates the propagation of very low-frequency waves in magnetospheric ducts, focusing on the phenomenon of leakage due to transverse gradients of refractive index. The author uses the WKBJ approximation and phase integral methods to study how waves are trapped by ducts and propagate to conjugate points. A new type of mode called a quasi-trapped mode is discussed, which selectively traps certain components of a wave packet, allowing them to travel considerable distances before leaking from the duct.
