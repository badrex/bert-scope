tldr: 'This study investigates the dynamic plastic behavior of clamped circular plates subjected to impact by a cylindrical projectile. The authors develop a theoretical analysis based on a rigid viscoplastic material obeying the von Mises yield condition and associated flow rule. The results are compared with experimental data, demonstrating good agreement and providing insights into the dynamic behavior of the system.'
