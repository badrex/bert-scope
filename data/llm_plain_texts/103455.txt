tldr: A person was killed by lightning during a thunderstorm in Worcester. The lightning struck through a window pane and caused a hole in it. The victim, an officer's lady, was seated near her husband when the lightning struck. She survived for 6-7 minutes after the strike, with visible copper-colored streaks and spots on her body. The husband and others in the room experienced temporary numbness, pain, and reddish wheals on their bodies. The author discusses the possible causes of the injuries and the unusual intensity of the lightning and thunder during that time.
