tldr: This article discusses the methods of making steel and tempering tools in ancient times. The author explores the differences between steel and iron and explains how steel was made by melting and purging iron. The author also describes the process of tempering tools, particularly picks and anvils, by boiling them in molten iron and quenching them in cold water. This technique was used to create a strong and hard surface on the tools, which were then finished on the grindstone and hone.
