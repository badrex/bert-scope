tldr: This article examines the mineral composition and structure of both sedimentary and crystalline pearls. It explores the similarities between pearls and other mineral concretions, such as carbonate of lime calculi and pisolite concretions. The author also discusses the various types of nuclei found in pearls and the concentric layers of mineral matter that form their structure. The article highlights the ongoing debate about whether pearls belong to the animal or mineral kingdom and presents evidence for both sides of the argument.
