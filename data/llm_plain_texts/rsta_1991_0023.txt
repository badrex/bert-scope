tldr: This article discusses the theory and examples of incommensurate structures in solids, focusing on their origin, general theory, and the role of incommensurate structures in mineral solid solutions. The author reviews formal theories and provides examples of incommensurate structures in simple compounds like biphenyl and quartz, as well as in mineral examples like plagioclase feldspar solid solutions.
