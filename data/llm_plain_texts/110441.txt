tldr: 'Michael Faraday conducted experiments on electricity and discovered that a powerful electric current can be generated when a conductor, such as a long wire, is broken. He also found that this effect is enhanced when the wire is coiled into a helix or used as the helix of an electro-magnet. This discovery led to the development of electromagnets and electromagnetic machines.'
