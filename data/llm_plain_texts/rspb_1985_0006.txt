tldr: The authors studied the effects of acetylcholine on primary pacemaker cells in the rabbit sino-atrial node. They found that the first detectable effect of acetylcholine is a decrease in the slope of the pacemaker potential without a detectable hyperpolarization or change in action potential duration. This negative chronotropic effect is blocked by atropine and is mimicked by low doses of acetylcholine or muscarine chloride.
