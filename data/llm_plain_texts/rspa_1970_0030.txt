tldr: This article investigates trapped holes and excitons in alkaline earth fluorides using electron paramagnetic resonance and optical absorption spectra. The authors study the self-trapped hole centers and other hole center types, including the center involving interstitial fluorine ions. They also discuss the kinetics of reorientation and decay of these centers and the properties of hole centers in alkaline earth fluorides.
