tldr: The authors used dielectric data to calculate the Lifshitz-van der Waals force for interacting mica and quartz plates. They compared their results with previous calculations and experimental values, finding better agreement for distances of less than 5 nm. The study highlights the importance of using complete dielectric data for accurate van der Waals force calculations.
