tldr: This paper reexamines the basic postulates and constitutive equations of thermomechanics, providing a different approach to the development of the subject. It discusses the kinematics of a deformable medium, the principles of conservation laws, and the thermomechanical theory of deformable media. The paper also explores the implications of invariance under superposed rigid body motions and the role of surface and body forces in the mechanical theory.
