tldr: This study examines the fine structure of chordotonal organs in the legs of the shore crab, Carcinus maenas. These organs consist of scolopidia embedded in elastic connective tissue strands. The anatomy and histology of chordotonal organs in various leg joints are described using light and electron microscopy. The organs are found to have two types of scolopidia: isodynal, with similar sensory cells, and heterodynal, with dissimilar sensory cells. The study provides insights into the structure and function of these proprioceptive organs in crustaceans.
