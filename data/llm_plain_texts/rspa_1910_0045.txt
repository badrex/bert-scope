tldr: The author investigates how small cylindrical and spherical obstacles affect sound extinction in a viscous atmosphere. The results show that when the dimensions of the obstacles are small compared to the sound wave length, the obstacles can significantly dampen sound. The study also considers the impact of fog on sound propagation, concluding that very small water droplets in fog do not interfere with sound.
