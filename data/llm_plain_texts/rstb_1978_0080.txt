tldr: This article discusses the discovery and history of cytokinins, their distribution in plants, and their biosynthesis and metabolism. Cytokinins are compounds that promote cell division in plants, and they have been identified in various plant sources. The article also highlights the challenges in isolating and identifying these compounds due to their low levels in plants. The presence of cytokinins in transfer RNA (tRNA) is also discussed, but its significance remains unclear.
