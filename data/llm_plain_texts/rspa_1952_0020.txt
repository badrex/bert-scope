tldr: The authors measured the second virial coefficients of binary mixtures of organic vapours, focusing on chloroform and diethyl ether. They found that at higher temperatures, the mixtures showed a linear relation, while at lower temperatures, there was curvature. This behavior was interpreted as being due to association by hydrogen bonding, with an energy of 6020 cal/mol. The results provide insights into the behavior of mixed organic vapours and the role of intermolecular forces in their properties.
