tldr: Researchers have identified mutations that disrupt the differentiation of specific cell types in maize leaves, specifically the bundle sheath cells. These mutations help in understanding the regulation of bundle sheath cell development in maize, which is crucial for photosynthesis. The study provides insights into the mechanisms controlling photosynthetic cell-type differentiation and the role of genes in normal development.
