tldr: The authors introduce a coordinate system based on the intrinsic properties of a twisting null geodesic congruence. They demonstrate how to choose a coordinate system that simplifies the form of the vectors of the congruence and discuss the freedom in the choice of the coordinate system. This coordinate system does not generally admit a physical interpretation.
