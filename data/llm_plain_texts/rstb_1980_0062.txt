tldr: The article discusses the use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to study the biochemistry of contracting and relaxing muscles. The authors observed changes in phosphocreatine, ATP, inorganic phosphate, and other biochemical intermediates during muscle contraction and recovery. They also studied the control of glycolysis and the relationship between muscle force development, relaxation, and substrate levels. NMR provided valuable insights into muscle fatigue and the underlying biochemical processes.
