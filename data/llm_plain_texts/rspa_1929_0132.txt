tldr: The authors investigated the catalytic properties of silver in the union of hydrogen and oxygen. They discovered that silver forms two types of oxide films, with the low-temperature oxide being a more effective catalyst. The mechanism of catalysis involves alternate oxidation and reduction of the surface, with the active oxide being more easily reduced to silver by hydrogen.
