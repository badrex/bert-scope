tldr: John Ingenhousz, a body physician to the Imperial family, made significant improvements in the field of electricity. He invented a flat glass plate machine that could generate more electricity than previous globe or cylinder models. He also discovered that old, warm glasses were better for electrical machines due to their increased hardness and resistance to moisture. Additionally, Ingenhousz experimented with pasteboard disks coated in amber varnish to generate electricity, creating a more cost-effective and durable option.
