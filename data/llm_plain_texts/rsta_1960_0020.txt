tldr: The authors provide a general theoretical treatment of the linearized Boltzmann equation for flow in a bounded medium, considering various types of particles such as gas molecules, electrons, and phonons. They focus on elucidating results for a specimen of general cross-section and discuss boundary conditions related to particle scattering by the specimen surfaces. The study covers different types of particle collisions and their effects on particle flow, providing a comprehensive understanding of the Boltzmann equation for various situations.
