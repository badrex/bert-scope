tldr: The author, Joseph Jopling, demonstrates the relationship between cardioids and ellipses, showing that both are related to and can be derived from the cone. He also explains how various curves, such as hyperbolas, conchoids, and parabolas, are connected and can be derived using a double scale applied to a cone. This method allows for easy creation of projections of curved sections of cones, spheres, and other shapes.
