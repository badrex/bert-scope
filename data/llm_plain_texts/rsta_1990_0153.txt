tldr: This article presents a novel method for determining enantiometric purity at the 1% level using a laser-based polarimetric HPLC detector. The technique can be used for chiral agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals, offering improved limits of detection and precision compared to conventional polarimetry. The method does not require chemically pure samples and can be more economical in material.
