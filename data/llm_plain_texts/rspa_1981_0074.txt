tldr: This study explores how individuals perceive risks and benefits of various energy systems, such as coal, oil, hydro, solar, and nuclear energy. It focuses on understanding the beliefs and attitudes of the general public in Austria during a time of increasing concern about energy strategies and the controversy surrounding the country's first nuclear energy plant. The research uses a convergence between risk perception and attitude theory to provide a technique for describing and comparing risk perception across different energy systems and between various social groups.
