tldr: The authors analyze a model for the spread of Dutch elm disease and its impact on elm populations in the UK. They demonstrate that the model, using biologically plausible parameterizations, can mirror observed data over short timescales but also shows a wide variety of outcomes over century-long timescales. The study emphasizes the need for a better understanding of elm population dynamics and the epidemiology of the causal fungus to predict the future of the elm and the effect of human interventions.
