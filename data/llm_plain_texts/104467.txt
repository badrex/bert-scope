tldr: The author examines two dates in Arabian figures found on stones in Ireland and concludes that they are not as old as previously thought. The author provides reasons for this conclusion, such as the style of the letters and the images on the stones, which are more consistent with the 16th century. The author also discusses the evolution of writing styles and fashion during this period.
