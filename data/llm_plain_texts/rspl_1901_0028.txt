tldr: The author examines the pelvic plexus in Acanthias vulgaris, a species of ray, and finds significant variations in the number and position of nerves. These variations are used to evaluate theories of limb origin and development. The study also reveals differences between male and female specimens and provides insights into the correlation between the position of the girdle and the number of collector and post-girdle nerves.
