scientific_discipline: Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry
tldr: The authors, Henry E. Armstrong and E. Frankland Armstrong, discuss the study of enzyme action and the importance of understanding their specific activity. They focus on the enzymes maltase and emulsin, which have specific actions on a-glucosides and /3-glucosides, respectively. The authors also explore the relationship between enzyme and hydrolyte, the inhibiting effects of glucose and fructose on the action of invertase, and the nature of enzymes in relation to cane sugar.
