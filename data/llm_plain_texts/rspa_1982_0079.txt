tldr: The authors study the large-time solution of a class of initial-boundary-value problems for the nonlinear diffusion equation. They construct a consistent and rational asymptotic expansion of the solution, with the leading term being the appropriate similarity solution. The expansion involves solving a two-point eigenvalue problem and produces an infinite sequence of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. This approach is useful for understanding the behavior of solutions in the large-time limit and has implications for various physical situations.
