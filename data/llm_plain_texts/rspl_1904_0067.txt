tldr: The author, E. Rutherford, discusses the succession of changes in radioactive substances and their decay. He explains that the decay of activity in these products follows an exponential law and is accompanied by the production of new substances with distinctive physical and chemical properties. Rutherford also explores the complex decay of excited activity in radium and thorium, as well as the different types of rays emitted during the radioactive changes.
