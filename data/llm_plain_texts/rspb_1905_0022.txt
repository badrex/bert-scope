tldr: The authors discovered Anopheles (Myzomyia) Listoni, a malaria-carrying mosquito, in Calcutta for the first time. This finding challenges previous beliefs that Calcutta had no endemic malaria due to the absence of known malaria carriers. The presence of Anopheles (Myzomyia) Listoni in Calcutta suggests that the previous observations of no endemic malaria might have coincided with a dormant endemic curve. This discovery is important for understanding malaria distribution and public health efforts in the region.
