tldr: This article investigates the propagation of elastic surface waves guided by ridges using the finite element method. The technique is applied to various problems with cylindrical geometry, such as wave propagation along bars and plates. The study focuses on the lowest mode that can propagate unattenuated and shows that only the lowest antisymmetric mode is properly trapped by the ridge. The findings have implications for seismology and microwave electronics, as ridges can guide surface waves in these fields.
