tldr: 'This article presents an investigation into the conductivity of various heat insulators, such as air, sawdust, charcoal, and paper. The authors developed a method to measure the specific conductivity of these materials at lower temperatures and smaller ranges than previous experiments. They found that hair felt was the best insulator among the tested materials, and they also observed indications that the conductivity might be a function of temperature.'
