tldr: This study investigates the development of the auditory apparatus in the New Zealand Tuatara, a reptile on the verge of extinction. The research focuses on the development of the pharynx, head cavities, blood vessels, cranial nerves, and the inner ear. The findings reveal several primitive features in the development of the auditory region, which is similar but more primitive than that found in Lacertilia. The study provides a detailed account of the development of the inner ear, including the formation of the utriculus, semicircular canals, and macular areas.
