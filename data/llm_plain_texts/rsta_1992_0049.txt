tldr: This study investigates the diffusion of carbon dioxide in nitrile rubbers under varying pressure and concentration conditions. The researchers found that the diffusion coefficient increases with increasing pressure, but eventually decreases at high pressures. They attribute this to gas-induced plasticization and the hydrostatic pressure effect. The results indicate that the diffusion process is not simply Fickian, and a complex parametric function is necessary to describe the sensitivity of the diffusion coefficient to time, concentration, and pressure.
