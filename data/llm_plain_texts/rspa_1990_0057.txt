tldr: The article investigates the interaction of fluid and structure noise generated by turbulent flow over surface inhomogeneities on an elastic half-space. The author develops a canonical problem to estimate the scattered radiations produced by a point source near a surface inhomogeneity and applies it to predict the acoustic and structural noise. The study focuses on the excitation of different wave modes, their power spectra, and the scattering cross-section of the inhomogeneity.
