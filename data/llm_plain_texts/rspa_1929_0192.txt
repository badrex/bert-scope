tldr: The authors studied the decomposition of potassium hydrogen oxalate hemihydrate crystals and found that the reaction occurs at the interface between the solid phases. They observed that the rate of advance of the interface is constant for any given edge and is not affected by the presence of water vapor. The reaction has a high temperature coefficient, and the energy of activation varies depending on the crystal's habit and edges. The authors also investigated the effect of adsorption and occlusion of reactants during crystal growth.
