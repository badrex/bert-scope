tldr: The authors study the adiabatic flash photolysis of NO2 and SO2 and debunk the misconception that a high-temperature isomer of SO2 causes the temporary disappearance of its spectrum. They find that the phenomenon is due to temperature broadening of the molecular structure. The authors also observe a similar effect in NO2 and discover two new triplet systems of SO.
