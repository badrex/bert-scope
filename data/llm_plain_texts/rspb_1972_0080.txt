tldr: The authors conducted experiments with mevalonic acid and isopentenyl pyrophosphate isomerase to study the stereochemistry of isopentenyl pyrophosphate isomerase. They found that the enzyme adds a deuteron from the medium to the 3R or 4R face of the double bond in isopentenyl pyrophosphate, creating chiral methyl groups. This discovery helped establish the stereochemical relationship between added and abstracted hydrogen in the enzyme-mediated prototropic isomerization.
