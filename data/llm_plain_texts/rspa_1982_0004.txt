tldr: The authors discuss exponential transformation models, a type of parametric models in mathematical statistics. They show that these models possess an explicit exponential representation in terms of a -dimensional, real affine representation of the group generating the model. The models have important properties and can be extended to larger (composite) exponential transformation models for various purposes, such as model control. The inference for these models is described in general terms, and examples of such models are discussed.
