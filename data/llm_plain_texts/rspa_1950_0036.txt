tldr: The authors present a general method for calculating electronic wave functions for stationary states of atoms and molecules using Gaussian functions. They demonstrate that this method can be used with the molecular orbital and localized bond methods, providing a way to evaluate wave functions for more complex systems. The authors also discuss the potential for applying this method to atoms and its implications for atomic and molecular structure.
