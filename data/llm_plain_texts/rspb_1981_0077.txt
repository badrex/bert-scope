tldr: Researchers discovered that botulinum toxin, a potent neurotoxin, blocks the release of acetylcholine from motor nerve endings. They found that even when the toxin reduces the endplate responses to a very low level, the release continues to be dispersed along the terminal arborization. This suggests that the toxin molecules interfere with the sites of transmitter release through a more graded and indirect mechanism rather than an all-or-none fashion.
