tldr: The article discusses the inositol trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R), a protein that releases calcium ions from intracellular stores in response to various extracellular stimuli. The receptor's structure, function, and localization are explored, as well as its role in calcium signaling and its importance in cell biology and molecular neurobiology.
