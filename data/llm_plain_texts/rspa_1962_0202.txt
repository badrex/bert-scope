tldr: The authors developed a method to measure the transport of sand in water flows using radioactive tracers. They introduced a small amount of radioactive sand into the flow and tracked its movement downstream. By analyzing the time it takes for the tracer to pass a fixed section, they could determine the rate of sand transport. This method can be applied to study the movement of sand in rivers, estuaries, and other environments.
