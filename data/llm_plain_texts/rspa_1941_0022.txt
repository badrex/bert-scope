tldr: The article discusses the morphological and histological changes in the cuticle of cyclorrhophous flies during puparium formation. It also explores the natural frequencies of vibrating systems with restricted freedom and the determination of dielectric constants of conducting liquids. Additionally, the article presents X-ray spectroscopy techniques for analyzing the level systems of substances in the solid state.
