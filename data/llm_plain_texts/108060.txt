tldr: The author, George Dollond, describes the development of a concave achromatic lens that can be used in wired micrometers for telescopes. This lens increases the magnifying power of the telescope without increasing the diameter of the micrometer wires, providing a significant advantage when observing minute double stars. The lens also improves the field of view and reduces the strain on the observer's eye.
