tldr: The article discusses the mechanics of transformation toughening in ceramics, focusing on the phenomenon of stress-induced transformation in zirconia-toughened ceramics. The authors present a continuous distribution of strain centers to represent the inelastic strain due to stress-induced transformation and explore the relation between theoretical and experimental measures of toughness. They also analyze the factors that limit the maximum toughness achievable through this mechanism.
