semantic_tags:
  - Thin films

  - Boundary lubrication
  - Contact resistance
tldr: This article investigates the electrical conductivity of thin oil films and their role in lubrication and contact resistance. The authors find that the thickness of the film has a significant impact on its conductivity, and that the films consist of air with minute globules that do not wet the surface. This research has implications for understanding the behavior of materials in electrical contacts and machinery.
