tldr: The author presents a method for dealing with definite integrals in spherical harmonic analysis and expands the potentials of ellipsoids and ellipses in series. The method is applied to various cases, including the potentials of an ellipsoidal shell and the forces between two solid ellipsoids or magnetized ellipsoids. The author also discusses the limitations and applications of the method.
