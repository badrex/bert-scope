tldr: This study examines the ecological characteristics of the primary trophic level in a secondary succession, focusing on primary production, reproductive strategies, and recruitment of young stages. The research finds that although standing crop and litter biomass increase through succession, primary production remains within a specific range. The study also reveals trends in leaf life expectancy, reproductive allocation, and seedling survival, as well as the role of non-native species in the succession process.
