tldr: The authors conducted an X-ray study on the dissociation of a copper, iron, and nickel alloy. They discovered unusual diffraction effects and explained that the original cubic lattice was deformed by the segregation of different atoms. This study provided insights into the structure and properties of the alloy during the dissociation process.
