tldr: The article investigates the role of space-time topology in constructing spinor fields and demonstrates the existence of inequivalent spinor structures in four-dimensional space-time. This leads to the existence of inequivalent Dirac lagrangians with interaction terms arising only in topologically non-trivial space-times. These findings have implications for quantum gravity and other subjects involving fields in non-trivial space configurations.
