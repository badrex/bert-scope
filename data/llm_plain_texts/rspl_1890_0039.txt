tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand how an increase in intracranial pressure affects the circulation and respiration. They found that increased pressure influences these processes by reducing the activity of the medulla. The results showed that the changes caused by pressure depend on the degree of medulla's activity impairment. The study provides insights into the effects of brain injuries on the body's systems.
