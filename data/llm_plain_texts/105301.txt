tldr: This article describes a case where four rough stones were discovered in a human urinary bladder, contrary to the common belief that a smooth stone surface indicates the presence of only one stone. The author, Joseph Warner, successfully extracted the stones using a lateral method of cutting for the stone. This case study highlights the importance of carefully examining the bladder during surgery to avoid leaving stones behind and causing further complications.
