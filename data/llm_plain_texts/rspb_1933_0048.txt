tldr: The authors investigated the antiseptic and trypanocidal properties of benzoylamino quinoline anil and styryl compounds. They found that some of these compounds have significant antiseptic and trypanocidal activity, with varying degrees of effectiveness and toxicity. The compounds with a dimethylamino group in the benzene nucleus were found to be inactive against trypanosomes, while others showed promising results. The authors also observed that these substances can have a prolonged prophylactic effect due to their persistence in the subcutaneous tissues.
