revised_title: 'Neurotransmitter Receptor Expression in Xenopus Oocytes: GABA, Glycine, and P-Alanine'

  - Glycine Receptors
  - P-Alanine Receptors
tldr: The authors studied the responses of Xenopus oocytes to GABA, glycine, and P-alanine induced by messenger RNA from rat and chick brains. They discovered that different species of mRNA code for receptors to GABA and glycine, and possibly separate P-alanine receptors. The pharmacological properties of the three amino acid responses also differed, suggesting distinct receptor types.
