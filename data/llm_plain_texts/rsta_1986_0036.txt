tldr: 'This article discusses the geological history of the Malvern Lineament, a major north-south trending crustal structure in the United Kingdom. The authors use a combination of techniques, including mapping, seismic-reflection profiling, deep drilling, and geochronology, to study the tectonic activity and evolution of the area. They describe the uplift, thrusting, and erosion that occurred in early Palaeozoic and late Carboniferous times, as well as the extensional lithospheric stress field in Permian and Triassic times, which led to the reactivation of earlier thrusts as major normal faults.'
