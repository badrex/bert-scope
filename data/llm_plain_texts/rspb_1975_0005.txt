tldr: The oviducal gland in octopods plays a crucial role in the storage of sperm and production of egg-laying cement. The gland consists of two main parts: the central gland, which produces a sulfonated mucopolysaccharide, and the peripheral gland, which produces a mucoprotein. These substances mix together and coat the eggs as they pass through the gland, forming a cement that helps fix the eggs to a suitable substrate. The gland also stores spermatozoa, which are attached to the wall of the spermathecae using their acrosome, and can remain there for several months before the female reaches maturity.
