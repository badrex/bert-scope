tldr: 'Ralph Thoresby, a Fellow of the Royal Society, discovered a collection of Norman coins in York. The coins were found during the construction of a new building and were preserved in an oak box. Thoresby analyzed the coins and identified them as some of the rarest and most valuable coins from the Norman era. The coins were minted in various locations, including London, Lincoln, and possibly Lorn or Lancaster. Thoresby shared some of the coins with Dr. Hans Sloane, hoping that they would be of interest and value to him.'
