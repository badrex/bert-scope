tldr: The article is a biographical memoir of Cyril Norman Hinshelwood, a renowned chemist who made significant contributions to the field of chemical kinetics. Hinshelwood's research focused on the study of homogeneous gas reactions, chain reactions, and the mechanisms behind them. His work led to the development of the concept of quasi-unimolecular reactions and the understanding of the role of chain processes in various reactions. Hinshelwood shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with N. N. Semenov for their work on chain reactions.
