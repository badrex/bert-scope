tldr: The authors investigated the velocity of pulse waves in the human body and found that a lower pulse wave velocity indicates a more efficient and continuous circulation and economical functioning of the heart. They also discovered that pulse wave velocity is dependent on pressure and arterial elasticity, which can be used as a criterion for the general efficiency of the circulation.
