tldr: The article discusses the importance of meteorological factors in the transmission of airborne diseases in livestock. It emphasizes the need for collaboration between meteorologists and veterinarians to provide appropriate advice and control measures during disease outbreaks. The authors suggest considering environmental factors, such as thermal environment, ventilation, and air hygiene, to reduce the risk of infection.
