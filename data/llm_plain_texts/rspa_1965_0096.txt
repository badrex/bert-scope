tldr: This article discusses the reasons for conducting high energy neutrino experiments and the potential questions they aim to answer. It explains the concept of an intermediate boson and its possible effects on weak interactions. The article also explores the two types of neutrinos, their decay processes, and the possibility of investigating the structure of nucleons, hyperons, and isobars through neutrino experiments.
