tldr: This article discusses the long-range dispersal of plant viruses by arthropod vectors, focusing on the ecological context and the role of active migrant forms of species in colonizing new habitats. The author concludes that distant spread occurs more frequently than generally supposed and is an extreme expression of dispersive processes that occur repeatedly over shorter distances.
