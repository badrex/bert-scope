tldr: The authors conducted experiments to find ways to increase the sensitivity of animal tumours to X-rays, which could improve cancer treatment. They discovered that injecting trypan blue or thorotrast into the tumours made them more sensitive to X-rays, leading to better results in treating the tumours. Other substances, like vital new red and isamine blue, did not have the same effect.
