tldr: In 1821, a collection of fossilized teeth and bones of various animals was discovered in a cave at Kirkdale, Yorkshire. The author, William Buckland, investigated the geological position and relations of the rock in which the cave is situated and provided a detailed account of the animal remains found in the cave. This discovery sheds light on the state of the Earth during a period before the last great geological event that affected its surface.
