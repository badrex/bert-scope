tldr: This article investigates the behavior of laminar boundary-layer flow near separation with and without suction. The authors extend the work of Goldstein and Stewartson, developing an asymptotic solution that is independent of any integral condition. They provide numerical solutions for the skin friction and velocity distribution near separation, confirming the existence of a singularity at the separation point. The study also compares the results with the equation of similar profiles and offers insights into the fluid dynamics of boundary layers.
