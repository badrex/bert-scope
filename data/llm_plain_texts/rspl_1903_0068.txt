tldr: The authors prove that the maximum order of an irreducible covariant of a system of binary forms is determined by the highest order of the quantic in the system. They also show that if no quantic of the system is of order exceeding a certain value, the maximum order of an irreducible covariant is the test of the herc S is an, in fact, the in the coefficient of the quantic in question.
