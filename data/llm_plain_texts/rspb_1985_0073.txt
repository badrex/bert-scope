tldr: The study investigates how the electrical activity of sheep cardiac Purkinje fibres changes with varying stimulation rates. It found that the action potential duration is sensitive to rate changes, with a peak at around 60 beats per minute. The research also discovered that rapid stimulation of sheep Purkinje fibres leads to overdrive excitation, where spontaneous activity is accelerated when stimulation ceases.
