tldr: This article describes a magnetic survey of the West of France conducted by Stephen J. Perry and W. Sidgreaves. They used various instruments to measure the dip, declination, and horizontal intensity at multiple stations. The results were used to create maps of isodynamic, isoclinal, and isogonic lines. The authors also discussed the secular variation of the magnetic field and the probable errors of their observations.
