tldr: The authors conducted a detailed study of the chromosome cycle in Coccidia and Gregarines, two types of protozoa. They found that the nuclear divisions in these organisms are mitotic, and the chromosome numbers remain constant throughout their life cycles. The researchers also discovered that reduction occurs immediately after fertilization, rather than during gametogenesis, and that there is no differentiation in chromosome number between the sexual and asexual cycles.
