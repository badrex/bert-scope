tldr: The author examines the state of hybernation in animals, comparing it to ordinary sleep and exploring its effects on respiration, temperature, and sensitivity. The study focuses on hedgehogs, dormice, and bats, observing their respiration rates, temperature changes, and ability to withstand the absence of air during different stages of sleep. The author also discusses the connection between the different levels of sleep and the animal's overall health and well-being.
