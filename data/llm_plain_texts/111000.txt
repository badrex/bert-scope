tldr: The author, William John Hay, discovered a varnish made of pitch, naphtha, and copper sub- and per-oxides that effectively protects iron from oxidation and foulness when exposed to sea and other waters. This varnish forms a barrier against electro-chemical action between copper oxide and iron, and multiple coats provide optimal protection. Trials on ships have shown promising results.
