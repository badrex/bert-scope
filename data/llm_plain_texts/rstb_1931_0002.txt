tldr: The author studies the inheritance of sinistrality in Limnaea peregra, a common British freshwater snail. They discover that the twist of an individual snail is determined by the nuclear composition of its parent, and not by its own chromosomes. This phenomenon is an example of "delayed inheritance," where the twist of an individual is predetermined in the unfertilized egg and is not affected by the sperm. The study provides insights into the genetic and developmental processes of gastropod molluscs.
