tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effects of ozone on the activity of oils and charcoal. They found that oils become active when mixed with ozone, while charcoal's activity depends on the air contained within its pores. This challenges the absorption theory of gas activity. The author also discovered that oxidation of the photographic image is accelerated by the least refrangible end of the spectrum.
