tldr: The author analyzes the interstellar lines in the rocket spectrum of 6 Scorpii, studying the physical conditions in the interstellar medium. They find that certain elements, such as silicon and iron, have slightly higher abundances compared to solar values, while others are underabundant. The results provide insights into the composition and behavior of interstellar clouds.
