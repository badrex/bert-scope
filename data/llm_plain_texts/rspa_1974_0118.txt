tldr: This article describes a method for determining integrated band intensities from experimentally measured peak band intensities using computer-generated synthetic spectra. The authors apply this method to the Swan band system and find that peak band intensities are not proportional to integrated band intensities. They also discuss the importance of accurate instrumental line width and correlation factors in calculating integrated band intensities.
