tldr: The article presents a unified theory of surface roughness, focusing on the properties of peaks and summits of a rough surface. The authors predict the heights of maxima and the frequency of excursions above a particular level using the correlation function. They also discuss the impact of the sampling interval on the surface properties and propose a new random surface theory that accounts for a finite sampling interval and an arbitrary correlation function.
