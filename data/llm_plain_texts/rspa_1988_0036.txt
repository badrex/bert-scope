revised_title: Electromagnetic Suspension and Levitation Techniques: Applications and Limitations
semantic_tags:
  - Electromagnetic suspension
  - Levitation techniques
  - Maglev technology
  - High-speed trains
  - Magnetic bearings
tldr: This article discusses electromagnetic suspension and levitation techniques, their principles, and applications. It explains the limitations of these methods, such as Earnshaw's theorem, which states that stable suspension is impossible with permanent magnets in a static field. The article also covers various methods of suspension and levitation, including using diamagnetic materials and superconductors, and their potential applications in high-speed trains, magnetic bearings, and other transportation systems.
