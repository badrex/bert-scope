tldr: The Exxon Donor Solvent (EDS) coal liquefaction process is a direct liquefaction method developed by Exxon Corporation. It involves chemically reacting coal with a hydrogenated recycle, converting coal into liquid hydrocarbons. The process has been tested in a 250-ton pilot plant and offers ease of operability and flexibility. The EDS process uses a hydrogen donor vehicle, which contributes to the stabilization of free radicals formed during coal decomposition, resulting in low molecular mass products and synthetic crude oil.
