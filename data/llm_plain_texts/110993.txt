tldr: The author describes and compares the fossils of Belemnites and Belemnoteuthis found in the Oxford Clay near Trowbridge, Wiltshire. The study reveals essential differences in the form and structure of their chambered calcareous cones, such as the presence of two flat longitudinal ridges in Belemnoteuthis and a smooth surface in Belemnites. The author also demonstrates the calcareous shelly periosteum or capsule that surrounds the guard and expands into a horny sheath or receptacle, which was previously unknown. This research helps to clarify the distinctions between the three genera of naked Cephalopoda found in the argillaceous deposits of the oolite in Wiltshire.
