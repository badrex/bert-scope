tldr: The authors analyzed the hyperfine structure in the arc spectrum of xenon, confirming the nuclear spin of some isotopes and providing insights into the behavior of nuclear moments in odd isotopes. They also compared the xenon line structures to those of mercury, finding a striking similarity, which supports the correctness of their interpretation.
