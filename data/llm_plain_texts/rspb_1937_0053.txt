tldr: The author investigates protein catabolism in starving barley leaves and discovers that protein breakdown plays a significant role in the respiration process. They analyze the transformation of proteins and other nitrogenous compounds during progressive starvation and find that loss of protein occurs in plants under conditions of carbohydrate shortage. The study provides insights into the importance of protein catabolism in the respiration of highly starved and yellow leaves.
