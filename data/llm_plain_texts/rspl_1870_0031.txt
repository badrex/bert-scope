tldr: The author examines the development and structure of the frog skull in ten different stages, from the unhatched embryo to the adult frog. They conclude that the adult frog's skull is highly compound, made up of a posterior part, laminar growth from facial arches, and various cartilages and bones that form the mouth, palate, face, and throat. The study also highlights the significant metamorphosis that occurs in the hyoid arch during the transformation from tadpole to frog.
