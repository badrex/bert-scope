tldr: The authors conducted experiments on a wide range of materials to study wear mechanisms under unlubricated conditions. They discovered two contrasting forms of wear: mild and severe. Mild wear is usually observed at light loads, while severe wear occurs at heavier loads. The wear rate is found to be independent of the apparent area of contact and often increases roughly proportionally with the load. The authors propose general rules of wear based on their experimental results and theoretical considerations.
