tldr: The authors study a spatially extended, individual-based model of a generic host-pathogen system and find that it exhibits new dynamical and evolutionary phenomena compared to mean-field models. They discover that selective pressure is reduced, and the pathogen population can evolve to criticality, leading to faster evolution and reduced stability.
