tldr: The authors investigate the oscillations and stability of a rotating ellipsoidal shell containing fluid. They derive a frequency equation of the 6th degree and find two fundamental modes of oscillation. The study concludes that the hypothesis of a fluid interior does not explain the observed variations in latitude, contrary to a previous suggestion by M. Folie.
