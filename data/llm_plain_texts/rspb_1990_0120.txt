tldr: The authors conducted a study on the bodies and flukes of nine different cetacean species, including the harbor porpoise, white-sided dolphin, white-beaked dolphin, common dolphin, white whale, Sowerby's beaked whale, minke whale, fin whale, and sperm whale. They measured various parameters such as body volume, mass, wetted-surface area, and fluke area, comparing these values between species to identify correlations with swimming performance. This research can help improve our understanding of cetacean propulsion, energetics, and locomotion, as well as inform the design of man-made oscillating propellers.
