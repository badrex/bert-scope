tldr: This study investigates the response of a bad cavity bistable system to the rapid switch-on of an injected light field. The system consists of a linear array of sodium atomic beams in a low finesse Fabry-Perot etalon. Although preliminary results show low branch to high branch switching, there is no evidence of the expected nutational oscillations. The most plausible reason for the non-appearance of Rabi oscillations is that the light field inside the cavity is not switching on fast enough to obtain a coherent transient.
