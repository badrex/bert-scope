tldr: The study investigates the effects of innervation and muscle activity on the development of skeletal muscles in rat embryos. By comparing muscles from embryos with destroyed motoneurons and chronically paralyzed muscles with normal embryos, the researchers found that the development of secondary myotubes, which form the majority of muscle cells in adults, is dependent on innervation. New muscle fibers cannot be generated without muscle contraction.
