tldr: This article examines the seismicity, geomorphology, and structural evolution of the Corinth area in Greece. The authors study the relationship between seismicity and landforms in space and time, tracing the area's evolution over the last 40,000 years. They discuss processes that occurred in the 1981 earthquakes and propose that surface faulting appears only above linear faults at depth that move in earthquakes with magnitudes greater than six. The study provides evidence for the evolution of the fault systems through eyewitness accounts, historical and archaeological data, and radiocarbon dating of molluscs collected from fossil shorelines.
