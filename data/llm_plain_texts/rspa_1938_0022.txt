revised_title: 'Aerofoil Hydrodynamics: Moving Aerofoils and Vortex Interactions'
semantic_tags:
  - Fluid Dynamics
  - Aerofoil Design
  - Vortex Theory
  - Aerodynamics
  - Moving Aerofoils
tldr: The authors extend the hydrodynamical theory of moving aerofoils to include the effects of surfaces of discontinuity and discuss the implications of their findings on the formulae used in aerodynamics. They also analyze the motion of a liquid surrounding a cylinder when a vortex is outside the cylinder and explore the forces and couples on the general cylinder under various conditions.
