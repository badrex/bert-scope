tldr: This paper presents an analysis of fringe anemometers, Doppler-shift anemometers, and combined systems for measuring local mean and fluctuating components of velocity in turbulent flows. The authors describe different optical geometries and evaluate the signal imposed on the photodetector. They demonstrate the relative merits of various arrangements for measuring mean and fluctuating velocity in two directions, providing insights into optimizing optical anemometers.
