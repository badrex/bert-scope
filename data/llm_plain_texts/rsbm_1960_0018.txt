tldr: The article is a biographical memoir of John Lionel Simonsen, a prominent chemist born in 1884. Simonsen made significant contributions to the field of organic chemistry, particularly in the synthesis of norpinic acid and the study of essential oils. He also played a crucial role in the development of Indian science, serving as a founder member of the Indian Science Congress Association and working as a chemical adviser to the Indian Munitions Board during World War I. Simonsen's research on Indian turpentine led to the discovery that it consisted largely of d2-carene, replacing the isomeric pinenes found in other turpentine oils.
