  - Thunderclouds
tldr: Isham Baggs investigates the disruptive discharge of accumulated electricity and its relation to lightning. He describes two instruments for regulating the discharges of a Leyden jar and explains how the tension of electricities in a series of jars can be greatly augmented, leading to violent explosions. Baggs applies his findings to the understanding of thunderclouds, considering them analogous to a battery with varying electric tensions.
