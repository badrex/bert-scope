tldr: The authors analyzed the infra-red and Raman spectra of alkyl substituted ethylenes to study deformation vibrations of hydrogen atoms attached to a double bond. They found characteristic frequencies for different types of substitution and assigned these frequencies to specific modes of vibration. The study provides a theoretical explanation for the persistence of these frequencies in alkyl substituted ethylenes and helps in understanding the structure and properties of hydrocarbons.
