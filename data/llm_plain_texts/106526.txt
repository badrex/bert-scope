tldr: In 1781, Tiberius Cavallo observed a luminous arch in the sky that was different from the aurora borealis. The arch was white, dense, and extended from east to west, reaching the horizon on the west side and about 50-60 degrees above the horizon on the east side. It did not pass through the zenith and was not a cloud, as stars were visible through it. The arch gradually lost its brightness and vanished by eleven o'clock. This phenomenon was unique and distinct from the aurora borealis due to its density, star-eclipsing ability, stationary nature, and east-west direction.
