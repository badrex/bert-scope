tldr: The author presents a method to derive full matrix representations for all space groups and double space groups using ray representations. This method is efficient and provides a way to obtain matrix representations without using extensive tables. The theory is applicable to point groups and space groups, and the author discusses the relationship of their method to recent treatments by Slater and Kovalev.
