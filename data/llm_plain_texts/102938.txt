tldr: A young girl in Yorkshire passed three stone-like objects through her stool. The objects were smooth and glossy, with rough and gritty parts. They were composed of a mix of downy and gritty substances, with a central glassy particle. The girl's green sickness and tobacco pipe use may have contributed to the formation of these objects. This case study provides insight into the variety of substances that can be found in the human body.
