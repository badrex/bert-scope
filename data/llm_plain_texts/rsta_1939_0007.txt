tldr: This article presents an investigation of the specific heat of gases at high temperatures, focusing on gases used in internal combustion engines. The authors conducted explosion experiments to measure the heat loss and used spectroscopic data to determine the molecular heat at constant pressure. They found that at high temperatures, the perfect gas state is attained, and their results can be used to improve the understanding of internal combustion engines' performance.
