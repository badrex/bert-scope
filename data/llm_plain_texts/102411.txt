tldr: This article describes a unique case of a young negro-boy from Virginia who, starting at the age of three, began developing white spots on his skin. The spots increased in number and size over time, and the boy remained healthy and active. The author discusses the boy's physical appearance, comparing the color and texture of the spots to that of white skin, and speculates about the potential future development of the boy's pigmentation.
