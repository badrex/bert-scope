tldr: The author investigates the presence of bright carbon flutings in the spectra of celestial bodies, such as nebulae, stars, and the aurora. They find that these spectra closely resemble those of comets and suggest that both nebulae and stars may be groups of meteorites. The study provides further evidence for the meteoritic nature of these celestial bodies.
