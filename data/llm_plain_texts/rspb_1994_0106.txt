tldr: This study investigates the differences in cuticular hydrocarbon composition between male and female grasshoppers of the species Chorthippus parallelus. The research also examines how these compositions change across a hybrid zone where two subspecies of the grasshopper interact. The findings show that there is a clear separation between male and female hydrocarbon compositions, and the transition from one blend to another occurs in a clinical fashion across the hybrid zone. This suggests that cuticular hydrocarbons may play a role in sexual communication and mate selection in this species.
