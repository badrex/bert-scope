tldr: The author, Edward Sabine, conducted observations on the dip of the magnetic needle in London in 1821 and 1828. He found a decrease in the dip of 17 minutes and 5 seconds over seven years, indicating a possible change in the Earth's magnetic field. He suggests that further observations could provide more insight into this phenomenon.
