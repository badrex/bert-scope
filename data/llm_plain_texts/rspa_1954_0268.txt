tldr: The authors investigated a self-sustained reaction between solid iron and potassium permanganate, studying the reaction rates and mechanisms. They found that the thermal conduction theory of propagation accurately describes the reaction, and the reaction rates can be calculated using this theory. The authors also discussed the products of the reaction and the role of temperature and reaction on the thermal conductivity of the materials.
