tldr: The authors describe a method for accurately measuring the positions of X-ray sources using the Copernicus satellite. They discuss the limitations of the accuracy, which is mainly affected by the uncertainty in the experiment pointing direction and statistical fluctuations in counting rates. The authors successfully measured the positions of several sources and examined the proposed associations between sources and bright stars, finding them unlikely.
