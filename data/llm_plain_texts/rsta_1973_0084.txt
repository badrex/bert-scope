tldr: This article discusses recent advancements in homopolar machines, which generate a steady electromotive force in a moving conductor. The authors explore the challenges of current collection, heat management, and torque provision, and present a solution using an all-steel construction and a liquid metal alloy of indium and gallium. They also describe potential applications in electrolytic processes, marine propulsion, and liquid metal fast breeder reactors.
