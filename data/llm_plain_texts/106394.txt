tldr: The author discusses the phenomenon of sexual dimorphism and hermaphroditism in animals, focusing on pheasants. They describe cases of pheasants changing their secondary sexual characteristics, such as feathers and spurs, later in life. This change is not due to a mix of male and female parts but rather a shift in secondary properties, which may be influenced by age and certain constitutional factors.
