tldr: This article investigates the effects of tidal friction on a planet with multiple satellites and its implications for the evolution of the solar system. The author demonstrates that tidal friction has a minimal impact on the expansion of planetary orbits and suggests that the distribution of satellites in the solar system is influenced by the efficiency of solar tidal friction.
