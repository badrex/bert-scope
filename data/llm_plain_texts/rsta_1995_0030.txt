tldr: This article discusses the role of soil microbial processes in the exchange of trace gases between land and the atmosphere. It reviews the cycling of atmospheric trace gases such as methane, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbonyl sulfide, nitrous oxide, and nitric oxide in soil. The article highlights the importance of understanding these processes to predict changes in the source and sink strengths of trace gases and their impact on climate and global change.
