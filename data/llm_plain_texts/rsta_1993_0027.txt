tldr: 'The author presents a numerical method for solving the nonlinear Boltzmann equation applicable to gases with chemical reactions. The method considers the effects of activation energy and heat of reaction on the velocity distribution of reacting particles, leading to an increase in the rate of chemical reactions. The study focuses on a chemical reaction with high activation energy and large heat release, such as combustion reactions, and provides a solution to the Boltzmann equation for this scenario.'
