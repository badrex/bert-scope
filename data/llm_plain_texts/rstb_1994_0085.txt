tldr: 'This article explores the potential of phylogenetic patterns to quantify and estimate organismal biodiversity at a level below species. It discusses the use of phylogenetic information to prioritize and weight species for conservation, focusing on the concept of option value at the feature-level. The author presents a framework for using pattern to quantify feature-diversity and evaluates alternative strategies for quantification and estimation. The article highlights the importance of considering assumptions when prioritizing or weighting species for conservation.'
