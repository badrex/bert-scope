tldr: This article discusses the radiative balance in the atmosphere, focusing on thermal radiation in the upper atmosphere. The authors develop a method for computing heating rates for a vibration-rotation band without using Kirchhoff's law, considering the effects of departures from a Boltzmann distribution. They apply this method to a model of the carbon dioxide band and analyze the heating rate per unit volume at different heights.
