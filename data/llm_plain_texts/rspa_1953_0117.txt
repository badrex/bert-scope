tldr: This study investigates the influence of nitric oxide on the opposing reactions of the equilibrium between ethylene and ethane. The results show that nitric oxide inhibits both reactions, and the forms of the inhibition curves are similar for both. The findings support the thermodynamic requirements for the equilibrium constant, demonstrating how opposing reactions combine to maintain the correct form of the equilibrium constant.
