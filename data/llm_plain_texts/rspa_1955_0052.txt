tldr: This article investigates the stability of plane shock waves using a corrugated piston model. The study finds that the stability decreases as the shock Mach number increases above and decreases below 1.14. The research provides insights into shock wave behavior and can be useful in understanding the more complex problem of cylindrical shock waves.
