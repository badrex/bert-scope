tldr: The author investigates the development of the mammalian sympathetic nervous system in embryos, focusing on its origin, morphology, and connections with the spinal nerves. They conclude that the sympathetic system is mesoblastic, formed in situ, and initially independent of the cerebro-spinal nervous system. It becomes connected with certain spinal nerves through the growth of white rami communicantes, leading to irregular gangliation. The main cord also gives rise to peripheral non-medullated nerves, plexuses, and ganglia, as well as the medullary portions of the suprarenal bodies.
