tldr: This article discusses the genetic approaches to attenuate influenza A viruses for vaccine development. The authors describe their experience with mutant genes that affect viral RNA transcription or synthesis, resulting in a reproducible level of attenuation in wild-type influenza A virus. They emphasize the importance of identifying stable mutant genes that confer a satisfactory level of attenuation for the production of live virus vaccines.
