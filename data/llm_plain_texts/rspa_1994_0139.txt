tldr: The authors explore the generalized Burgers and Zabolotskaya-Khokhlov equations, focusing on their applications and transformations. They discuss the equivalence of different forms of the equations and present new exact solutions for the exponential horn and cylindrical far-field cases. The study has implications for understanding shock and caustic formation in acoustic wave propagation.
