tldr: The study investigates changes in inositol lipids and phosphates during the differentiation of HL60 promyelocytic cells into neutrophils or monocytes. Significant changes were observed in the levels of inositol polyphosphates, suggesting that they may play a role in the processes of hematopoietic differentiation or the expression of differentiated cell character in myeloid cells.
