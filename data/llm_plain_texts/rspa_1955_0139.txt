tldr: The authors conducted a neutron-diffraction study of the ferroelectric transition in potassium dihydrogen phosphate, confirming Slater's theory that the protons in the ferroelectric phase are in ordered positions. They also observed the movement of hydrogen atoms when an electric field is applied, demonstrating the maintenance of a crystal as a single ferroelectric domain.
