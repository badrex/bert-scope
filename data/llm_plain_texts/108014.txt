tldr: The author examines the development of mollusk embryos and the structure of their shells. They observe that shells form during embryonic development and provide insights into the shell's structure, including the nucleus and periostracum. The study also discusses the differences in shell structure between various mollusk species and the role of the shell in the animal's life cycle.
