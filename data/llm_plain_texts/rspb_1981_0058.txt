tldr: This article presents a hypothetical stochastic model of radiation effects on single living cells. The model incorporates two important details of the radiation mechanism overlooked in previous studies: the generation of secondary particles by primary radiation particles and the difference in time scales between radiation damage and subsequent processes in the damaged cell. The authors discuss the mathematical details of the model and compare its implications with empirical findings in the literature.
