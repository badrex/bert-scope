tldr: This article discusses the use of two-liquid phase biocatalytic reactors for industrial applications, where a large proportion of the reaction volume is occupied by the organic phase. The reactors have been investigated for steroid transformations, modification of oils and fats, and other organic reactions. Immobilized cells and enzymes have reasonable operational stabilities in these reactors, and some commercial processes are being developed. The choice of organic solvent and catalyst form can influence reaction kinetics and equilibria, and the reactors offer advantages in terms of product recovery and catalyst separation.
