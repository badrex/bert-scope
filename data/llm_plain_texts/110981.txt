tldr: The author conducted experiments on board an iron steam vessel to determine if steam's effect on the vessel's hull and keeling could impact a compass's accuracy. The results showed that keeling does significantly affect compass deviations, emphasizing the importance of measuring compass deviations throughout a ship's voyage.
