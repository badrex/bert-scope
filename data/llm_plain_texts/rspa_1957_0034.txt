tldr: The authors studied the reactions between polymer radicals and ferric chloride in non-aqueous media, specifically in -dimethylformamide solution. They found that the rate of polymerization of acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, and styrene is inversely proportional to the ferric chloride concentration. The results allow for the calculation of kinetic constants for the radical-salt reactions and provide a method for determining the rates of chain starting in the polymerizations. The authors also discuss the influence of structural features on the reactivity of the radicals and the behavior of the system under various conditions.
