tldr: The author discusses the impact of dredging operations on the tidal regime of the River Mersey, specifically the effects on the tidal curves and the overall improvement of the port of Liverpool. The dredging operations increased the depth and width of the channel, allowing larger ships to navigate the river more easily. The study compares tidal curves from 1893 and 1903, showing little to no difference in the range of the tide and the form of the curve, indicating the success of the dredging efforts.
