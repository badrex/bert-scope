tldr: This article explores the stress produced in a semi-infinite solid when pressure is applied to part of its boundary. The author develops a potential method to analyze the displacement and stress in the solid, focusing on rectangular and circular areas under uniform pressure. The study provides a foundation for understanding the safety of structures and estimating their strength.
