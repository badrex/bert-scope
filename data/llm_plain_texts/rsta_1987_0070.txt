tldr: The article discusses the impact of radiocarbon dating by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) on archaeology. AMS allows for smaller sample sizes and potentially doubles the datable time span compared to conventional techniques. This has led to a significant impact on archaeology by extending the range of organic remains that can be dated and allowing for more selective sampling strategies. The author reviews recent archaeological applications of the technique and outlines its potential future applications.
