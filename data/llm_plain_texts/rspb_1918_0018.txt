tldr: The author investigates the mechanism and control of fibrillation in the mammalian heart, focusing on the changes in the manner of conduction of the excitation process in the cardiac musculature. They discover that fibrillation is a condition of "fasciculation" rather than "fibrillation," and that it can be induced by depressing agencies or excessive rapidity of excitation. The study establishes the importance of depression of conductivity in the occurrence of fibrillar beats and the relationship between the rate of succession and the degree of dissociation in fibrillation.
