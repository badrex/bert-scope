tldr: Bruno Mendel was a German-born scientist and physician who made significant contributions to the fields of cholinesterase research and cancer treatment. He discovered that cholinesterase consists of two different enzymes, the 'true' and the 'pseudo' cholinesterase, and that only the 'true' cholinesterase plays a role in the physiological destruction of acetylcholine. Mendel's work on cholinesterase, along with his research on cancer cell metabolism, led to advancements in understanding the chemical transmission of nerve impulses and potential treatments for malignant growth.
