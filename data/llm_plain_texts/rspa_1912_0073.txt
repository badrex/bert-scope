tldr: This article discusses the causes of apparent changes in the total mass of chemically reacting substances. The authors review the work of Prof. Landolt, describe their experimental setup, and outline methods for calculating results. They identify and address potential sources of error, such as air streams, differences in reaction vessel areas, and temperature variations. The authors also introduce new devices and precautions to improve the accuracy of their weighings, ultimately reducing the limit of error to + O006 mgrm.
