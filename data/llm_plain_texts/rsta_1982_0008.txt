tldr: This article discusses the relationship between particle physics and cosmology, focusing on the early universe as a cosmic accelerator for testing grand unified theories. It explores constraints on models of particle physics through cosmological and astrophysical observations, including baryon non-conservation, free quarks, heavy hadrons, and primordial nucleosynthesis. The article also examines the implications of these findings for the understanding of the universe's evolution and composition.
