tldr: The author shares two intriguing discoveries: a Capricorn beetle found alive inside a sound piece of wood and a fish horn that penetrated 8.5 inches into a ship's timber. The beetle is likely a type of Scarabaeus, while the fish's forceful intrusion into the ship's structure raises questions about the strength of marine life.
