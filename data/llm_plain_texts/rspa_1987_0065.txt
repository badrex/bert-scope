  - Stroh eigenvalues
tldr: The authors explore the existence of type-6 transonic states in linear elastic media of cubic symmetry. They demonstrate that these states occur in 21 out of 25 cubic media studied and provide a method to find these states using inverse type and Stroh's method. The study helps in understanding surface-wave propagation and the behavior of elastic materials.
