tldr: The authors investigate the stability of large amplitude ion acoustic waves and solitons in two-component plasmas. They find that solitons are stable, while nonlinear waves are unstable, except for a significant range of parameters where they are only unstable to fully three-dimensional perturbations. The study provides insights into the behavior of ion-acoustic waves and their potential applications in plasma physics.
