tldr: This study examines the effects of high calcium solutions on frog neuromuscular junctions. It shows that prolonged exposure to high calcium causes structural changes, such as aggregation of synaptic vesicles and swelling of mitochondria, which lead to impaired muscle function. The findings suggest that calcium ions play a crucial role in the disorganization of nerve endings and the subsequent loss of function.
