tldr: The author discusses the membrane of chromaffin granules in the adrenal medulla, focusing on their morphological and biochemical properties. The membranes have a high content of lysolecithin and specific proteins, and the enzymes Mg2+-ATPase, dopamine /?-hydroxylase, and cytochrome b-559 are present. The function of these enzymes and the role of the membranes in the accumulation and secretion of catecholamines are explored.
