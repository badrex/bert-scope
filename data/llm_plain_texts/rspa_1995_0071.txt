tldr: The author presents a path-linking interpretation of Kirchhoff diffraction, explaining how the Kirchhoff field satisfies the wave equation and obeys specific boundary conditions. The path interpretation allows for a deeper understanding of the topology underlying Kirchhoff's theory and can be used to compare it with other diffraction models.
