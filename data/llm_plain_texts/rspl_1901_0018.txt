tldr: The authors analyze the composition of dust and soot from various sources, including cosmic dust, and find that it contains similar elements to those found in meteorites. They use spectroscopy and elemental analysis to identify the presence of iron, cobalt, nickel, silicon, carbon, and phosphorus in the samples. The authors conclude that cosmic dust is falling continuously and imperceptibly on Earth, challenging the understanding of atmospheric dust composition.
