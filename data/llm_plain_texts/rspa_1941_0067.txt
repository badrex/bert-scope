tldr: The authors studied the interchange of hydrogen in the adsorbed film on tungsten. They found that a rapid interchange occurred between hydrogen and deuterium gases at low temperatures. The results suggest that hydrogen and deuterium are equally strongly adsorbed on tungsten at 29 K. The authors concluded that only 20-40% of the chemisorbed deuterium is sufficiently reactive to interchange with hydrogen gas in the time of the experiment.
