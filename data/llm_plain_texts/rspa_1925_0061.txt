tldr: The authors propose a new concept of the catalytic surface, where only a small fraction of the surface is active and has varying capacities to adsorb gas and promote catalytic change. They argue that the surface can be composed of atoms in different degrees of saturation by neighboring metal atoms, which affects the surface's adsorptive capacity and reactivity. This concept explains the sensitivity of catalysts to heat treatment and poisoning, as well as the varying catalytic capacity of the surface atoms.
