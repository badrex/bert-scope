tldr: The authors discovered a novel cholinergic receptor in chick cochlear hair cells that mediates their inhibition. Acetylcholine hyperpolarizes the hair cells by opening a cation channel, leading to the activation of a larger potassium current. This receptor has physiological and pharmacological similarities to the nicotinic receptor, as it is blocked by antagonists like curare, atropine, and a-bungarotoxin.
