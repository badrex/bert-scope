tldr: The authors developed a high-stiffness machine tool to perform single-point diamond machining of soda-lime glass and optical glassy quartz. They found that below a critical depth of cut, material is removed by plastic flow, resulting in crack-free surfaces. This research contributes to the understanding of brittle-ductile transitions and the process of single-point grooving, which can lead to improvements in glass and ceramic manufacturing processes.
