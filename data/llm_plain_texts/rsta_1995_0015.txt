tldr: This article discusses the physics and chemistry of hydrogen in materials, focusing on disorder and dissipation in quantum diffusion. The authors explore the effects of crystal disorder on the behavior of tunnelling objects and the role of barrier fluctuations in particle interactions with the environment. They also analyze the particle motion in long-ranged potentials and the dynamics of ion and muon states in normal and superfluid 3He.
