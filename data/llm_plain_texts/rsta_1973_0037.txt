tldr: This article discusses the neotectonic development of Mount Etna in relation to surrounding tectonic regions of Sicily, the Tyrrhenian Sea, and southern Italy. It explains the structural control of volcanism at Mount Etna and the relationship between its activity and the earlier Iblean volcano. The study also highlights the importance of monitoring earth movements in the region to provide a measure of the secular strain pattern and give warning of crustal extension, volcanotectonic doming, and lava eruption.
