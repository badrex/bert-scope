tldr: This article explores complex potentials in two-dimensional elasticity, providing solutions for two elastic problems involving body forces for a circular disk. The author finds exact solutions for complex potentials in cases of a heavy circular disk fixed at one point and a disk rotating around an eccentric point. The study offers insights into stress analysis and engineering applications.
