tldr: The authors analyze the condensation theory of supersaturated vapours and criticize the assumptions made by Becker & Doring and Frenkel. They argue that these theories are only first approximations and should be improved to account for small molecular complexes. The authors also compare their findings with experimental data on critical supersaturations for water vapour and suggest that more measurements are needed for a better understanding of the phenomenon.
