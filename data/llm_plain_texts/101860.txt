tldr: This article discusses the observations of the eclipse of Jupiter's moon by the Royal Observatory at Paris in 1686. Mr. Cassini, assisted by other astronomers, used telescopes to study the eclipse. The observations were difficult due to the vapors near the horizon, but they managed to record the central immersion and emersion times. Other observers, such as R. P. Bonfam and Mr. Wurtzelbauer, also shared their observations from Avignon and Nurenburg. The article also mentions a letter from the famous Mr. Hevelius from Dantzick, who provided his observations of the same eclipses.
