tldr: The study examines the relationship between light intensity and calcification rate in the coral Acropora cervicornis. It explores the role of oxidative phosphorylation in calcification and finds that inhibitors and uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation block light-enhanced calcification. The findings suggest that photosynthetically fixed carbon plays a significant role in coral calcification.
