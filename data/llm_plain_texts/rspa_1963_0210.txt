tldr: The authors present a first-order exchange approximation to improve the Born-Oppenheimer approximation in calculating scattering amplitudes for the excitation of hydrogen atoms by electron impact and elastic scattering of electrons by hydrogen atoms. The first-order exchange approximation accounts for terms of the first order in the interaction energy between colliding particles, leading to more accurate cross-section calculations and addressing the ambiguity in the original approximation.
