tldr: The authors developed a radiotracer method to measure the adsorption of surface-active agents at the solution/air interface. They used a radioactive isotope of sulfur to track the adsorption of di-n-octyl sodium sulphosuccinate and sodium sulfate. The method provides a way to study the kinetics of adsorption processes and can be applied to other surface phenomena involving adsorbed layers.
