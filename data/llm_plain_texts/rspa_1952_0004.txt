tldr: The authors analyze the Hückel approximation, a method used to study the energy levels of conjugated systems, and reformulate it using the valence-bond method. They show that the approximation is valid for calculating resonance energies but may not be accurate for studying excited states. The authors also discuss the role of in-plane electrons in the molecule and their impact on the Hamiltonian and wave function.
