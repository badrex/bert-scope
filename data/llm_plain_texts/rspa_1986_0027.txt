tldr: This article explains how quarks and gluons materialize as jets of particles, which can be studied to investigate the fundamental physical laws governing their interactions. The author discusses the properties of jets and how they relate to quark parameters, emphasizing the similarities between quarks and leptons. The article also covers the different mechanisms of jet production and their implications for studying quark interactions.
