tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effects of phosphoric acid on liver function and urine composition. They found that injecting phosphoric acid into the circulation caused a saccharine state in the urine, indicating a perverted condition of the liver's processes. The unnatural state of the blood induced by the acid seemed to promote the conversion of amyloid substance into sugar. The author also observed that injecting the acid into the portal system caused the blood to solidify and stop the circulation, leading to the absence of sugar in the urine.
