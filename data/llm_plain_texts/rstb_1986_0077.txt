tldr: The authors propose a palaeoecological solution to the biogeographic problem of the North Atlantic islands' flora and fauna. They suggest that the islands lost most of their biota during the height of the glacial periods and were invaded and colonized mainly from northwest Europe during the short interglacial phases. The authors also explain the differences in endemic species between islands based on their distance from major glacial influences. This hypothesis is supported by the analysis of carabid beetle faunas and the study of Quaternary events and the flora and fauna of the region.
