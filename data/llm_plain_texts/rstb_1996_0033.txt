tldr: The neurotrophic hypothesis explains how target fields in the developing peripheral nervous system regulate the innervation density of neurons. It suggests that neuronal survival depends on the supply of neurotrophic factors synthesized in their target fields. Multiple neurotrophic factors, such as nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT3), and neurotrophin-4 (NT4), regulate the survival of certain populations of neurons. These factors act through cooperation, synergy, and sequential action during the development of sensory neurons.
