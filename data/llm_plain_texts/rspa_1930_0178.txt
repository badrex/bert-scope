tldr: This article presents a theoretical study of the elastic scattering of electrons in molecular hydrogen using quantum mechanical methods. The authors calculate the effective cross sections presented by hydrogen molecules to electron beams and find that diffraction effects are to be expected, with intensities determined by the orientation of the molecular axis relative to the initial and final electron beams.
