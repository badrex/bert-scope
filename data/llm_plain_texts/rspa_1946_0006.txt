tldr: This study investigates the helium content of atmospheric air at ground level and in the stratosphere. The researchers found that the helium content remains constant across various locations on Earth's surface. However, they discovered a helium surplus in the stratosphere, suggesting the existence of a region where helium becomes enriched. The study also discusses the potential influence of air currents and meteorological conditions on the helium content.
