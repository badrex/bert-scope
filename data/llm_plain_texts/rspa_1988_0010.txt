tldr: This article investigates the effect of crack size on the ductile-brittle transition in metals and alloys. It applies simple criteria for brittle and ductile crack extension to the stress and strain fields near the crack tip, considering the material's microstructure. The results show that the fracture toughness and transition temperature are sensitive to crack size and specimen geometry, with larger cracks displaying different behavior than smaller ones. The study highlights the importance of understanding scale effects in materials testing and structural design.
