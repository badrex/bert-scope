tldr: This study investigates the migration patterns and genetic structure of an island population in Karkar, Papua New Guinea. The authors use migration models to analyze the effects of movement and population size on genetic structure. They find that movement is primarily related to marriage and that younger age groups have higher levels of mobility. The study also reveals that the linguistic division between Waskia and Takia groups is preserved in the island's village groups, with little overlap between the two clusters.
