tldr: Sir William Crookes discovered a new element, Victorium, associated with Yttrium through a complex process of fractionation and spectroscopic analysis. Victorium is found to concentrate in the center portions of the fractions, being less easily decomposed than the earths of the cerium group and more easily decomposed than those of the yttrium group. This discovery expands the understanding of the properties and behavior of elements in the periodic table.
