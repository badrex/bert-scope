tldr: This article discusses the absorption spectra of various metals when volatilized by the oxyhydrogen flame. The authors, J. Norman Lockyer and W. Chandler Roberts, use a modified oxyhydrogen blowpipe and a lime tube to study the spectra produced by different metals. They observe channelled-space absorption and continuous absorption in the blue, and discuss the effects of temperature and metal purity on the results.
