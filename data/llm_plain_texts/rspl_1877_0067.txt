tldr: In this article, Professor Tyndall shares his observations on hermetically-sealed flasks containing infusions that were opened on the Alps. He found that flasks opened in a hay loft had organisms, while those opened near a precipice remained clear. This supports Pasteur's experiments on the Mer de G-lace. Additionally, the author and his colleague investigated the effect of light on the development of bacteria and other organisms in solutions. They found that light influenced the growth of bacteria, with some organisms thriving in light and others in darkness. These findings contribute to the understanding of the life-history of these organisms and their relationship with light.
