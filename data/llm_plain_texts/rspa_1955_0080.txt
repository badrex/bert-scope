tldr: The article presents a theory of unsteady flow past curved obstacles with infinite wakes, focusing on the case where perturbation velocities and displacements are small. The study includes a detailed analysis of unsteady Helmholtz flows and their applications to aerodynamic problems, such as the flutter of a stalled aerofoil. The theory is extended to incompressible flow and can be further expanded to deal with low-frequency oscillations in subsonic compressible flow.
