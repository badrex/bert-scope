tldr: The author discusses the release and fate of the adrenergic transmitter in the nervous system, focusing on the spleen as a model for studying its effects. They found that the amount of transmitter released is related to the frequency of nerve stimulation and that blocking agents can increase the amount of transmitter appearing in the venous blood. This research provides insights into the mechanisms of adrenergic transmission and its role in the sympathetic nervous system.
