tldr: The author introduces the Tertiary treatment of ties (TTT) as a hybrid between Primary and Secondary treatment to improve the mapping of pseudo-distances in policy selection. TTT is used in conjunction with the mdscal method to analyze and rank policies based on their characteristics. The author suggests that maps created using TTT can serve as a visual basis for argument and decision-making in policy selection.
