tldr: This article presents a general kinetic theory of liquids, focusing on the equilibrium properties. The authors define the entropy of the fluid and prove that it will generally increase towards a maximum, deriving the equilibrium solution of the fundamental equations without appealing to statistical mechanics. They also study the liquid state, distinguishing it from the gaseous state by the existence of real roots of a transcendental equation, and derive equations of state for both phases.
