tldr: The author investigates the equilibrium of two closely spaced drops suspended at different electric potentials. They derive a nonlinear differential equation that governs this equilibrium and study its solutions using various methods, including matched asymptotic expansions. The results show that the distance between the drops is reduced by one-half when they are about to coalesce, and the drops are not drawn out as previously expected from experiments on isolated drops.
