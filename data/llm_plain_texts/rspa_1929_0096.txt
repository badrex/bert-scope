tldr: This article presents a theoretical study of the cracking process of petroleum. The author develops a model for hypothetical oils consisting of paraffins and unsaturated hydrocarbons, considering the chemical equilibrium between the hydrocarbons in the reaction chamber. The results are compared with real petroleum cracking, showing a good agreement. The study provides insights into the cracking process and its potential improvements in practical applications.
