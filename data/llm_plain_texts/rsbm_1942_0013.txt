tldr: 'Tullio Levi-Civita was a renowned Italian mathematician who made significant contributions to various fields of mathematics, including differential geometry, tensor calculus, and relativity theory. He collaborated with Ricci to develop the absolute differential calculus, which laid the foundation for Einstein's theory of relativity. Levi-Civita's concept of parallel displacement is crucial in understanding parallelism on any surface and has applications in both pure and applied mathematics.'
