tldr: The study investigates the adsorption of thiourea on mercury electrodes and its effect on the structure and dielectric constant of the mercury-electrolyte interphase. The authors found that the adsorbed thiourea molecules behave as a two-dimensional imperfect gas, and the dielectric constant of the inner part of the double layer is independent of the surface concentration of thiourea but dependent on the charge on the mercury electrode.
