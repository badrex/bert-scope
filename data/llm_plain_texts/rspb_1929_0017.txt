tldr: This study examines a unique case of sex reversal in a pigeon, where both testicular and ovarian tissues were present in the same gonads. The research provides insight into the process of spermatogenesis and the development of sex-cords in birds, as well as the factors that contribute to sex reversal. The findings have implications for understanding sexual development in birds and may help identify potential treatments for sex-related disorders in humans.
