tldr: The study investigates the thermal decomposition of benzylamine and determines the dissociation energy of the C-N bond. The decomposition process follows first-order kinetics, and the activation energy is found to be 59 kcal/mol. The results provide insights into the heat of formation of the NH2 radical and the dissociation energy of the first N-H bond in ammonia.
