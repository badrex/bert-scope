tldr: This article explores the onset of convection in fluids with external restraints, such as rotation or magnetic fields. The author provides a general treatment for the transition from oscillatory to steady modes and applies this to rotating systems and the effects of magnetic fields. The study is relevant to understanding convective transport and its role in astrophysical applications.
