tldr: This article discusses the influence of the Earth's ionosphere on wireless communication. It explains how the ionosphere can bend and concentrate radio waves, allowing them to travel long distances. The article also explores the effects of the Earth's magnetic field on radio wave propagation and the limitations of certain wave lengths due to the ionosphere's properties.
