tldr: The study investigates the electrical activity and colonial behavior in eight species of Hexacorallia corals. The researchers found that a single electrical stimulus evoked a single electrical potential, and these potentials were responsible for controlling colonial polyp retraction. The nerve net pulses were conducted without decrement over large areas of the colony at a velocity of 15-25 cm/s at 25Â°C. The results suggest that interneural facilitation effects may not be significant in determining the spread of excitation in coral nerve nets, and a new explanation for colonial polyp retraction patterns is proposed.
