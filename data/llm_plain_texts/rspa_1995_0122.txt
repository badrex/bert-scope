tldr: This article discusses the law of the wall in turbulent flow, which is a cornerstone of fluid dynamics. The authors analyze the law's validity and limitations, particularly in relation to the law of the wall for temperature. They also explore the implications of these findings on turbulence models and measurement techniques like Preston and Stanton tubes.
