tldr: The authors conducted X-ray diffraction experiments on methane at low temperatures to study its structure transition. They discovered a change in the crystal structure at the A point, which is a transition of the second kind. The results showed that the structure transition is accompanied by an abnormal rise in specific heat and a change in the crystal structure, which is different from the behavior of long-chain hydrocarbons.
