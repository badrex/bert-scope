tldr: The author, Frederick Tiedemann, compares the brain structure of Negroes, Europeans, and Ourang-Outang to examine the validity of the opinion that Negroes have inferior intellectual abilities. He finds that there is no significant difference in the internal structure of the brain between Negroes and Europeans, and that the apparent inferiority of the Negro is due to the demoralizing influence of slavery and oppression.
