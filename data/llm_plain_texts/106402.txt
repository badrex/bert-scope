tldr: This article describes the case of a young girl suffering from St. Vitus Dance, a severe convulsive disorder. Despite previous treatments with volatile medicines, warm baths, and zinc, the girl's condition did not improve. The author then recommended trying electricity as a last resort. The girl was treated by the Rev. Mr. Underwood, an electrician, who applied electric shocks to various parts of her body. After several sessions, the girl's symptoms abated, and she eventually recovered completely. The author discusses the potential of electricity as an effective treatment for similar cases in the future.
