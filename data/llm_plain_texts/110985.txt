  - Equivalent Substitution
tldr: Thomas Andrews conducted experiments to determine the heat evolved during metallic substitutions. He found that when one metal replaces another in a solution of its salts, the heat developed is always the same, provided the metals are the same. This principle applies to any number of metals in similar relationships.
