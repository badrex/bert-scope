tldr: The author discusses the probability of errors in physical observations and the density of the Earth. They explore the relationship between compressibility, elasticity, and the density of various substances, including minerals, water, and air. The author concludes that the Earth's density varies due to compression and provides a formula for calculating the mean density based on this variation.
