tldr: The authors studied the chemico-structural degradation of Carboniferous lingulid shells from Scotland to understand the changes that occurred during fossilization. They found that the shells had a complex biomineral structure with fluorapatite francolite, which was secreted in stratiform laminations. The study revealed that the degradation of organic material during fossilization was not uniform, and the shells' chemico-structural changes played a significant role in their preservation. This research provides insights into the factors affecting the fossilization process and the evolution of lingulid shells.
