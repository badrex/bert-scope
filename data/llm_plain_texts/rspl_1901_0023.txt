tldr: The author, Sir Norman Lockyer, reports on the discovery of a new star in the Perseus constellation and its spectral analysis. The star's spectrum contains numerous dark lines and resembles that of Nova Aurigae. The author suggests that the observed changes in the star's spectrum may be due to the collision of two celestial bodies, and discusses the possible stages of temperature the star may pass through as its temperature decreases.
