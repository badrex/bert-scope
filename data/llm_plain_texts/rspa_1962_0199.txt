tldr: This article discusses corrections to the quantization of coupled orbits in metals. It addresses a point where an electron may pass through a Brillouin zone boundary, jumping onto another orbit, even if it involves tunneling through a region where no classically permitted energy surface exists. The author provides an improved criterion for when this breakthrough is significant and may be expected to occur.
