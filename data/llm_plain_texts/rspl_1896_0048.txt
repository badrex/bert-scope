tldr: This article explores the concept of telegony, a phenomenon where offspring resemble a previous mate of one parent, and its potential influence on human stature. The author analyzes family measurements and correlation coefficients to investigate the existence of a steady telegonic influence in humans. While the data is not ideal, it provides some insight into the relationship between heredity and telegony in human stature.
