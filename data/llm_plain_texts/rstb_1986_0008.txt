tldr: 'The authors discuss gene conversion, a non-reciprocal transfer of DNA sequences from one gene to a related gene, and its relation to homologous chromosome pairing in higher eukaryotes. They present evidence for a series of small gene conversions in the human foetal globin gene pair and suggest that gene conversions may be the consequence of a general mechanism that enables chromosomes to find their homologues during meiosis.'
