tldr: This article presents a theoretical analysis of the oscillations caused in bridges by the passage of a locomotive. The author simplifies the problem by idealizing the locomotive as a concentrated mass and develops a mathematical model to predict the state of oscillation. The study also highlights the importance of damping influences in the bridge and the effect of synchronism between the applied force and the natural frequency of the girder.
