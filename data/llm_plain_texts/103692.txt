tldr: In 1727, a Roman mosaic pavement was discovered near Grantham in Lincolnshire. The author, William Stukeley, provides a detailed description of the pavement's design and materials, as well as the surrounding archaeological context. He also discusses the Roman history and settlements in the area, including the Roman road called Hermenstreet and the village of Great Paunton, which he believes to be the Causennis mentioned in Antoninus's Itinerary.
