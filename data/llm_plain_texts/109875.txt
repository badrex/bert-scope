tldr: The author, John Pond, discusses Dr. Brinkley's observations of a periodical deviation in fixed stars, which may indicate annual parallax. Pond presents his own observations using two ten-feet telescopes and micrometers, comparing the results with Dr. Brinkley's findings. He concludes that the differences in observations may not be solely due to parallax and suggests looking for alternative explanations.
