tldr: This study investigates the hydrogen-oxygen reaction in vessels coated with alkali iodides, revealing a different reaction mechanism compared to chloride-coated vessels. The results show that the rate of reaction is independent of hydrogen pressure and is nearly proportional to oxygen pressure. The presence of iodine, formed by the action of hydrogen on the salt, suppresses the normal gas-phase reaction and leads to a different reaction mechanism. This research provides insights into the mode of action of alkali halides in controlling the hydrogen-oxygen combination.
