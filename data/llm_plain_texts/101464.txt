tldr: The author describes a method of preserving ice and snow using chaff, specifically barley chaff. The method involves lining the sides of a pit with chaff and then filling it with snow or ice. The chaff acts as insulation, allowing the ice or snow to last for up to six months without significant melting. This preservation technique could be useful for cooling drinks, fruit, and sweetmeats in England.
