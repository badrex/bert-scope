revised_title: 'Exploring the Chemistry of Coat-Color in Animals and Dominant and Recessive Whiteness'
semantic_tags:
  - Pigment chemistry
  - Animal coat color
  - Tyrosinase
  - Dominant and recessive traits
  - Peroxidase
tldr: The author investigates the chemistry behind coat color in animals, focusing on the role of tyrosinase and peroxidase enzymes. They discover that a dominant white color pattern in rabbits is due to the presence of an anti-tyrosinase or inhibitor in the skin, while the recessive white variety is caused by the lack of one or both of the oxidase and chromogen components of the pigment-producing system.
