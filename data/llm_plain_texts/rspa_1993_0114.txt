tldr: The author presents a new method to obtain exact solutions for a stream of bubbles in a Hele-Shaw cell when surface tension is neglected. The method involves using a symmetry transformation that maps the problem onto the case of a single bubble in a channel. The resulting two-parameter family of solutions displays a degeneracy in bubble velocity, which is expected to be resolved by considering finite surface tension.
