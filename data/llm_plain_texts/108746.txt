tldr: This article discusses the historical understanding of the sources of nitrogen in plants, focusing on the works of early scientists like Hales, Black, and Lavoisier. It highlights the debate on whether plants absorb nitrogen from the air or from the soil and presents the findings of De Saussure, who concluded that air and water contribute more to the carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen in plants, while soil provides nitrogenous compounds. The article also mentions the contributions of Boussingault and others in understanding the nitrogen sources in plants and crop yields.
