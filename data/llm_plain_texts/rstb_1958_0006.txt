tldr: 'This study examines the topography and physical features of Lagos Harbour and Lagos Lagoon, focusing on the water movements, salinity changes, and temperature variations. The research also explores the various habitats available for aquatic life and the impact of seasonal fluctuations in salinity on the organisms living in the area. The authors provide a survey of the lagoon, harbour, and marine deposits in the Lagos region, preparing for further contributions on the ecology of the region.'
