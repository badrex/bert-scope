tldr: The authors investigate the solubility of homogeneous additive equations, specifically focusing on the conditions under which the equations have solutions in integers. They develop methods to determine the number of solutions in a given range and establish a good upper bound for the least number of solutions. The study has implications for Artin's conjecture and the solubility of equations in the p-adic field.
