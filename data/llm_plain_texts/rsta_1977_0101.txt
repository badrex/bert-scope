tldr: This article discusses the deficiency of siderophile elements in the Moon and explores the hypothesis that the Moon formed from the Earth's mantle after siderophiles had been removed. The non-hydrostatic figure of the Moon and the requirement that mascons must be supported, along with the high heat-flow, imply that the Moon's metal is collected in the core, likely amounting to less than 1% of the Moon's mass. The authors argue that the fission origin of the Moon is geochemically plausible.
