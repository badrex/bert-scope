tldr: This study investigates the trapped wave modes and resonance in circular island-continental shelf systems. The authors find that there are two main types of trapped wave modes, and they analyze the effects of the island's shape and size on the trapped wave modes. They also explore the influence of Coriolis forces due to the Earth's rotation and examine evidence of these wave modes in tsunami wave records.
