tldr: This study compares the abundance and body size of British birds and mammals, finding that larger animals tend to be rarer than smaller ones. The research also reveals differences in abundance and body size relations between bird groups, such as resident and migrant birds. The findings contribute to the understanding of ecological patterns and the factors influencing species abundance and body size.
