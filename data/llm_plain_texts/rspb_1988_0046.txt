tldr: This study investigates the impact of dietary protein on the experimental epidemiology of Heligmosomoides polygyrus, a type of intestinal worm, in laboratory mice. Researchers found that mice fed a low-protein diet had higher parasite intensity and increased host mortality, while well-nourished mice had lower worm burdens and higher host survival. The results suggest that malnourished mice are more susceptible to intestinal worm infections.
