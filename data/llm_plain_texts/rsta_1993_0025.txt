tldr: This article investigates the Gortler instability mechanism in a hypersonic boundary layer on a curved wall, focusing on the effects of boundary layer growth, wall cooling, and gas dissociation in determining stability properties. The study assumes the fluid is an ideal gas with viscosity given by Sutherland's law and finds that gas dissociation and wall cooling can be either stabilizing or destabilizing for different modes of Gortler vortices. The research also highlights the differences in the basic state and downstream evolution properties of Gortler vortices when using Sutherland's law instead of Chapman's law.
