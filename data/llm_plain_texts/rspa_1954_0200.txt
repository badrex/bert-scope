revised_title: Localized Orbitals in Conjugated Molecules
semantic_tags:
  - Molecular Orbital Theory
  - Chemical Valency
  - Conjugated Systems
  - Quantum Chemistry
  - Semi-empirical Methods
tldr: The article introduces localized orbitals in conjugated molecules without approximation, using a transformation of occupied and virtual orbitals. This method is suitable for semi-empirical applications and provides a better understanding of the electronic structure of conjugated systems. The localized orbitals are associated with individual atoms in the conjugated system, making them more suitable for chemical analysis and interpretation.
