tldr: The author analyzed the age-combination fertility and legitimate natality of married couples in Budapest. They found that legitimate natality declines after the first child and that physiological fertility arrives later, remains high, and decreases at a more advanced age. The difference between physiological and actual fertility shows the influence of moral factors, with moral restraint having a significant impact on fertility rates.
