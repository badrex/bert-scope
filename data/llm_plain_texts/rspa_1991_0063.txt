tldr: The author investigates the behavior of reactive-diffusive systems, specifically combustion systems, using nonlinear evolution equations. They find that there are two distinct forms of description for nonhomogeneous blowup: exactly self-similar and asymptotically self-similar. The study focuses on equations of the form (1.1) and (2.1), which provide a good description of combustion systems within suitable limitations. The author derives asymptotically self-similar solutions for reaction-runaway and examines their structure, revealing a fairly universal structure for symmetric blowup.
