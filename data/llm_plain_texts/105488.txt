tldr: 'J. Michell proposes a method for measuring degrees of longitude on the Equator, which could help determine the Earth's shape more accurately. The method involves using a telescope to trace a great circle and measuring the distance between two stations. This technique could potentially lead to more precise mapping of countries near the Equator.'
