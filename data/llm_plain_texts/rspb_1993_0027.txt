tldr: Researchers found that male bushcrickets adjust the number of sperm and the amount of nourishment in their spermatophores based on the likelihood of sperm competition and their confidence of paternity. This study supports the theories of sperm competition and parental investment in bushcrickets, as males increase sperm count and reduce nourishment when mating with females with lower paternity confidence.
