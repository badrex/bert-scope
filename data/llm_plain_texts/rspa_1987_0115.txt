tldr: The authors investigate a class of one-dimensional evolutionary equations with hamiltonian structure, focusing on discontinuous solutions. They establish a connection between conservation laws and symmetries of the system, and classify various types of discontinuous solutions systematically. The study also provides a variational characterization of discontinuities and simple algebraic representations for discontinuities of limitingly small strength.
