tldr: The author, Arthur Cayley, explores the conditions for the existence of three equal roots or two pairs of equal roots in binary quartic and quintic equations. He demonstrates the use of matrices and determinants to express these conditions and shows the relationships between the coefficients of the equations. This work contributes to the understanding of the composition of relations in mathematical systems.
