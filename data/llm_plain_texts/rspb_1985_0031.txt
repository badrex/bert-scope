tldr: 'The author investigates the function of flowers and concludes that they are primarily male organs, with the majority of secondary floral structures designed to disperse pollen rather than fertilize ovules. This conclusion is based on observations and experiments with natural populations of herbs, which show that a small allocation to attractive structures is sufficient for fertilization, while larger flowers disperse more pollen. The findings support the hypothesis that secondary floral allocation is predominantly male.'
