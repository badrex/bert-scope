tldr: The article demonstrates the use of Rodrigues-Frank (RF) space to represent and display grain misorientations (mesotexture) in polycrystalline materials. The RF space allows clear representation of coincident site lattice (csl), low angle (la), and coincident axial direction (cad) boundaries, making it easier to assess the nature of the mesotexture. This method provides a novel way to display mesotextures and can be useful for understanding the properties of polycrystalline materials.
