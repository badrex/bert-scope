tldr: The author investigates the effect of moisture on the viscosity of hydrogen and finds that residual moisture has little to no impact on the gas's viscosity. The study compares various methods of hydrogen purification and desiccation, concluding that even without complete removal of moisture, the viscosity remains relatively consistent. This research contributes to the understanding of gas properties and their behavior under different conditions.
