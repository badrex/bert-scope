tldr: The study traces the central projections of sensory neurons in larval Manduca sexta, focusing on the antennal pathway, labral pathway, maxillary pathway, labial-hypopharyngeal pathway, mandibular pathway, and stemmatal pathway. The research provides insights into the neural centers for primary integration and processing of sensory information from receptors on the head and mouthparts of the larvae.
