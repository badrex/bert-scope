tldr: Researchers have isolated a soluble specific substance from a strain of water leptospira, which reacts exclusively with its homologous antiserum. The substance is highly specific and seems to be a carbohydrate-containing substance or a hapten. This discovery could aid in the development of differential tests for spirochetes.
