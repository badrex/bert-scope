tldr: This article explores the Noether operator for gravity and the electromagnetic field, focusing on the second-order energy flux. The author demonstrates how the perturbation of the total Noether operator leads to a conserved current that depends only on the first-order part of the field perturbations. This simplification allows for the definition of an energy flux associated with solutions of the linearized field equations.
