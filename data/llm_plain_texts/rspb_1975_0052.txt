tldr: The article discusses the use of stable isotopes as a tool to understand biogeochemical processes on Earth and potentially detect life on other planets. It explains how isotopic distribution is influenced by physical and biological processes, and how the study of stable isotopes can provide insights into the Earth's temperature fluctuations, mineral crystallization, and the search for extraterrestrial life. The author highlights the importance of understanding the fractionation factors in various reactions and the role of temperature and substrates in these processes.
