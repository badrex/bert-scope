tldr: The article presents a study on the behavior of solutions of a mathematical equation describing the advection-diffusion of a passive scalar by an incompressible velocity field. The authors introduce two simple models with turbulent transport properties and develop a complete mathematical treatment of their renormalization theory. This theory helps to understand the behavior of the models at large scales and long times, providing insights into the effects of randomness on the mean and the role of renormalization in turbulent transport.
