tldr: The authors derive doubly uniform approximations for the remainder in the optimally truncated saddle-point expansion for integrals containing a large parameter. They unite two types of asymptotic singularities in a common framework, incorporating the Stokes error function and canonical catastrophe integrals. This study provides a better understanding of the appearance of subdominant exponentials and the coalescence of exponential contributions as parameters vary.
