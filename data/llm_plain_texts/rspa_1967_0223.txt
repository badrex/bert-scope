tldr: This article investigates the flow properties of two types of non-Newtonian fluids, focusing on the impulse theory of flow and the behavior of suspensions with shear-induced interactions. The authors discuss the formation of bonds between particles and the resulting hydrodynamic drag forces, which affect the flow properties of these fluids. They also present experimental techniques and results for different fluids, showing that the impulse theory correlates well with the observed behavior.
