tldr: The author, A. Claudet, discovered that the image formed on the ground glass of the Camera Obscura appears in relief due to the different images refracted by the left and right sides of the lens. Each eye perceives a different image, creating a stereoscopic effect. This phenomenon can be used to create a new type of stereoscope that allows for better visual perception and relief in images.
