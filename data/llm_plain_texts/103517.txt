tldr: The author discusses the debate between the ancient belief that lungs cool and condense blood and the modern system of Dr. Pitcairn, who believed that lungs mix, attenuate, and expand blood. The author presents observations and calculations on various hearts to argue that blood is both cooled and mixed during the process of respiration, and that the lungs play a crucial role in the body's circulation and oxygenation.
