tldr: The authors discuss the role of the stigma surface in incompatibility responses in flowering plants. They describe the stigma pellicle, a proteinaceous layer on the stigma papillae, which is involved in the recognition process between pollen and stigma. The pellicle's structure and function are explored, and its role in mediating incompatibility responses is discussed. The authors also describe the complex cuticle structure associated with the pellicle and the development of extracuticular pellicle proteins in various plant species.
