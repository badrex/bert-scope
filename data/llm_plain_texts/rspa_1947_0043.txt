tldr: The author presents a method to increase contrast in microscopy by using interferometry and half-platinized surfaces. This technique enhances the visibility of transparent objects with slight refractive index differences from the surrounding medium, particularly biological specimens. The author also discusses alternative methods and potential improvements for this technique.
