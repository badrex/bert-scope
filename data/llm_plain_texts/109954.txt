tldr: 'The author, Sir Everard Home, presents observations on the internal structure of the human urethra made by F. Bauer using a microscope. The urethra is found to have two parts: an internal membrane and an external muscular covering. These findings disprove the common belief that the lining of the urethra consists of circular contractile fibers and provide new insights into the causes of stricture, a condition involving the narrowing of the urethra. The paper also discusses the structure of the corpus spongiosum and corpora cavernosa, which are related to erectile function.'
