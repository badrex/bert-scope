tldr: The study examines the anatomy and biology of misophrioid copepods, focusing on Benthomisophria palliata. It describes the skeletomuscular system, integument structure, and other organ systems, providing insights into their feeding, swimming, and reproductive mechanisms. The misophrioids' unique combination of ancestral, unique, and convergent characters makes their classification challenging, but the study suggests that they may be more closely related to the Harpacticoida than other orders.
