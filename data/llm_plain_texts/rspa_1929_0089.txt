tldr: This article presents a comprehensive study of streamline flow through curved pipes, focusing on the influence of curvature on the law of resistance. The author conducted experiments on three pipes with different curvature ratios and analyzed the results in relation to previous research. The findings provide valuable insights into the behavior of fluids in curved pipes, with practical applications in heating and refrigeration systems.
