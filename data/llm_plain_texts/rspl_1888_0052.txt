tldr: This study investigates the magnetic qualities of nickel under longitudinal compression. The authors conducted experiments on the effects of stress on the magnetic permeability and retentiveness of nickel. They found that the intensity of magnetization and residual magnetism were affected by the magnetizing force and stress applied. The results are displayed through curves showing the relationship between magnetic properties and stress.
