tldr: The authors used deuterium spectroscopy and gas chromatography to study the reactions of 2-methylpropene with hydrogen or deuterium on lanthana and zirconia. They found that exchange of 2-methylpropene was faster on lanthana than on zirconia, and that both catalysts showed activity for addition reactions. The authors proposed two main mechanisms responsible for these results: reversible interconversion of adsorbed alkene and adsorbed -allyl species, and reversible interconversion of adsorbed alkene and adsorbed alk-2-y1 species. The findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the reactions of 2-methylpropene and 2-methylpropane on oxide catalysts.
