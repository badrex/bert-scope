tldr: The author, William Snow Harris, invents and uses various instruments to measure the quantity of electricity and its attractive or repulsive force. He examines the charging of different shapes and sizes of conductors, discovering the relationship between their surface area, circumference, and electrical charge. The paper also explores the laws and phenomena of electrical attractive force, finding that the force depends on the number of attracting points and the distance between the conductors.
