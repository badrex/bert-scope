tldr: 'Wood ants, Formica rufa, were found to orient themselves using magnetic fields. In a controlled environment, ants were trained to visit a food source while all other orientational cues were eliminated. When the magnetic field was altered, a significant proportion of ants adjusted their orientation accordingly. This discovery shows that wood ants can use magnetic fields for navigation.'
