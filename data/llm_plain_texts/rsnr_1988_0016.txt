tldr: The article presents a collection of letters written by physicist Peter Kapitza to his mother during his time in England from 1921 to 1927. The letters provide insights into his experiences with English life, his scientific progress, and his relationship with fellow scientist Ernest Rutherford. Kapitza's time in Cambridge led to significant advances in high magnetic fields and low temperatures, and he became a prominent figure in the Cavendish Laboratory. Despite being unable to return to England in 1934, Kapitza continued to make outstanding contributions to physics and technology in the Soviet Union, eventually winning the Nobel Prize in 1978.
