tldr: The author analyzes the homologies and primary structures of serine proteinases, including chymotrypsinogen A, chymotrypsinogen B, trypsin, elastase, and thrombin. They find that these enzymes have a common catalytic mechanism and suggest that they descended from a common ancestor. The study also reveals similarities in the tertiary structure of these enzymes, indicating that they may have evolved relatively recently.
