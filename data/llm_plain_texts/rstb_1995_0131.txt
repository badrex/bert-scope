tldr: The authors present a novel cell-ablation strategy for studying plant development, using promoters with distinct cell specificities fused with cytotoxic and anticytotoxic genes. They demonstrate the potential of this strategy by applying it to anther development, highlighting the importance of understanding plant cell differentiation processes.
