tldr: Researchers conducted experiments to understand how pigeons perceive imperfect mimicry in insects. They found that pigeons can rank mimics according to their similarity to a wasp model, even if the mimicry appears poor to the human eye. This discovery provides a powerful tool for studying the evolution of these patterns and understanding the complexities of mimicry in nature.
