tldr: The authors studied the structure of carboxypeptidase A, a zinc-containing enzyme that breaks down peptides and esters, using crystallography. They determined the atomic structure at 0.2 nm resolution and analyzed the enzyme's interactions with glycyl-L-tyrosine. The findings helped clarify the enzyme's binding and catalytic mechanisms, providing insights into its function and potential applications.
