tldr: The author examines the structure and development of the skull in Insectivora, a group of placental mammals. They study the skulls of native species like hedgehogs, moles, and shrews, as well as exotic species, to understand the morphology of the skull in this order. The author also compares the skull development in Insectivora with other lower types of Vertebrata to gain insight into the evolution of the mammalian skull.
