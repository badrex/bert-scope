tldr: This article examines paternity frequency in eusocial Hymenoptera, specifically ants, bees, and wasps. It discusses the effects of paternity frequency on the kin structure of colonies and the evolution of social behavior. The study finds that high paternity frequencies are not common, and only a few species have queens with multiple paternity. The authors suggest that multiple mating may not be a general constraint for the evolution of eusociality in Hymenoptera.
