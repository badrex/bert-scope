tldr: The author describes an improved thermometer design that allows for accurate temperature measurement even when the observer is not present. The new thermometer features two separate mercury columns, each connected to an index that shows the highest temperature reached during the day or night. This innovation helps overcome the limitations of existing thermometers, which require the observer's immediate attention to record the highest or lowest temperature.
