tldr: John Canton discovered a method to create artificial magnets without using natural ones. He demonstrated that these artificial magnets were stronger and more effective than natural magnets for navigation and experimental purposes. The process involved stroking soft steel bars with iron tongs and touching hard steel bars with the newly magnetized soft steel bars. This breakthrough revolutionized the understanding of magnetism and its applications.
