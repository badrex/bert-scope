tldr: The Monte Rosa expedition of 1911 aimed to study the effects of altitude on the human body, particularly the changes in blood acidity and the dissociation curve. The researchers found that there is a considerable increase in haemacidosis, or the addition of abnormal acid to the blood, even in resting individuals at high altitudes. This study provided valuable insights into the physiological changes that occur at high altitudes and the role of lactic acid in these processes.
