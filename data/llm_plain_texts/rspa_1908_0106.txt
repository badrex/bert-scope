tldr: The author investigates the effect of water vapor on the motion of ions in gases. They found that water vapor influences the motion of negative ions but not positive ions. The results suggest that the presence of water vapor can alter the behavior of ions in gases, which has implications for understanding atmospheric processes and gas discharge phenomena.
