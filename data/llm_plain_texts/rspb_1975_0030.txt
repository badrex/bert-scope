tldr: 'The article discusses the structure and function of iridescent corneas in teleost fishes. Iridescent corneas are common among shallow water marine teleosts living among rocks or on the bottom. The iridescence is produced by interference and serves to increase visual range underwater without sacrificing sensitivity. The different structures responsible for iridescence are found in the endothelium, between Descemet's membrane and the stroma, and within the stroma itself. The iridescence helps to reflect bright downwelling light out of the eye, reducing intra-ocular flare and improving visibility.'
