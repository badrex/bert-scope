tldr: This article examines the optical design of the superposition eyes of scarab beetles, focusing on the lens elements in each ommatidium. The study reveals that the corneal facet and the underlying crystalline cone work together as an afocal lens system with an internal intermediate focal plane. The corneal facet is a graded-refractive-index lens in most scarab species, which contributes to the formation of a good superposition image at the rhabdom layer in the eye. The lens design is closely related to the daily activity patterns of the scarab species, with nocturnal and crepuscular species having larger and well-developed crystalline cones, while diurnal species have narrower corneal facets and smaller or waisted crystalline cones.
