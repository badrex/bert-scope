tldr: The authors attempted to measure the amount of atmospheric refraction at Port Bowen using various methods. Due to the intense cold, they found it difficult to use certain instruments. They eventually used a modified method proposed by Lieutenant Foster and Captain Parry, which involved observing the moments of star disappearance and measuring the zenith distances of boards. This allowed them to gather a series of observations on the moments of disappearance and reappearance of stars, providing valuable data for navigation and polar exploration.
