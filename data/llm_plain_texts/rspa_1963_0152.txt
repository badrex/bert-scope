tldr: This article explores the use of Fredholm integral equations in potential theory and elasticity to solve boundary-value problems. It discusses the advantages of Fredholm's first equation and Green's boundary formula, and presents a method for solving these equations numerically using digital computer techniques. The article also highlights the potential applications of this method in various fields, such as the Helmholtz equation and heat conduction.
