tldr: This article examines the melting points, interatomic distances, and compressibilities of transition elements to challenge the valency scheme proposed by Pauling. The authors propose a new scheme of metallic valencies that better aligns with the general inorganic chemistry of the elements, considering the differences in behavior between the first and later transition periods.
