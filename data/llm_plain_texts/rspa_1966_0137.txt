tldr: The authors explore the coupling of non-compact group representations, specifically focusing on the problem of coupling three'most-degenerate' representations of an SL(v, group. They demonstrate that the number of amplitudes to be expected for a vertex function based on collinear symmetry is infinite, and further approximations must be made to extract meaningful predictions. The study has implications for understanding the dynamics of elementary particle multiplets and their interactions.
