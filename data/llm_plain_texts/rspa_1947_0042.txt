tldr: The author presents a theory on the fragmentation of shell cases, focusing on the metal case of a cylindrical ring-bomb. The theory considers the scatter in the values of the reduction in area at which fracture occurs in a tensile test, which determines the fragment size. The distribution of fragment lengths is calculated, providing insights into the average size of fragments from a shell made of ductile materials like steel.
