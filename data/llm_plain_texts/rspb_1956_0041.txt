tldr: This article discusses the variation and polymorphism in the genus Viola, focusing on the species Viola riviniana. It explores the factors that control the complexity of the populations, such as habitat, phenotypic plasticity, and breeding systems. The author also examines the genetic control of certain size characters and the occurrence of vegetative reproduction, which can lead to a decrease in the number of genotypes in a population. The article highlights the importance of understanding these factors for the survival and adaptation of plants in changing environments.
