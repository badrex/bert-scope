tldr: The author applies stochastic geometry to study the distribution and interactions of plankton in the ocean. They demonstrate how patch structure can affect predator-prey encounters and nutrient flux rates, and how this theory can be used to improve the design of acoustic and optical sensors in the field of plankton ecology.
