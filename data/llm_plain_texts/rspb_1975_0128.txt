tldr: This study investigates the ultrastructural localization of acetylcholinesterase and nonspecific cholinesterase activity in ox adrenal medulla using cytochemical methods. The findings reveal that acetylcholinesterase activity occurs in both splanchnic nerve and chromaffin cells, with reaction end-products found at various sites, including around axons, within axonal endoplasmic reticulum, and between nerve terminals and chromaffin cells. These observations raise the question of whether the released acetylcholinesterase from the perfused adrenal gland originates from the endoplasmic reticula of splanchnic nerve and/or chromaffin cells.
