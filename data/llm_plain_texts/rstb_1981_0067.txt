revised_title: 'Chemistry of Proton Abstraction by Glycolytic Enzymes'
semantic_tags:
  - Glycolysis
  - Enzyme Mechanism
  - Aldolase
  - Pyruvate Kinase
  - Triose Phosphate Isomerase
tldr: This article discusses the mechanisms of glycolytic enzymes, specifically aldolase, isomerases, and pyruvate kinase. The author synthesizes intermediates that are rapidly utilized by these enzymes, and observes that they follow a stepwise proton transfer mechanism. The author also explores the structural homology and evolution of these enzymes, and their ability to efficiently use enol or eneamine intermediates.
