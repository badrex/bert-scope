tldr: This article investigates the classical theory of collision broadening and shift in atomic spectra, focusing on the Lennard-Jones potential. The authors evaluate constants and interpret measurements of collision broadening and shift caused by rare gases at low pressures. They discuss the impact approximation and its application to the Lennard-Jones potential, providing tabulated values of certain functions for numerical calculations.
