tldr: Victor Herbert Veley was a prominent chemist and educator who made significant contributions to the fields of physical chemistry, nitric acid research, and solution properties. He was a dedicated teacher who specialized in physical chemistry and played a crucial role in the development of chemical teaching in Oxford. Veley's best-known work is his research on nitric acid, and he also conducted important studies on the physical properties of solutions, including electric conductivity, refractive indices, densities, and contractions. His work on electromotive force in nitric acid cells, carried out with J. G. Bunch and Dr. Veley, was another notable achievement.
