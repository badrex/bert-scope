tldr: This article describes a lightning strike at Steeple Ashton and Holt in 1772, which caused damage to a house and its occupants. The authors emphasize the danger of placing iron in the upper part of chimneys without a conductor to protect against lightning strikes. The incident supports the idea that iron can conduct electricity and cause significant harm.
