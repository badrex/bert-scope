tldr: This article discusses recent methods for solving time-dependent partial differential equations, focusing on three types of algorithms: fast, general-purpose methods; classical finite-difference methods; and methods that prioritize accuracy. The authors explore the Crank-Nicolson scheme, Peaceman-Rachford method, and other techniques, highlighting their advantages and limitations, and provide suggestions for future developments in the field.
