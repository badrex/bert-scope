tldr: This study investigates how nest size and temporal availability of females affect sexual selection in the sand goby, Pomatoschistus minutus. The results support the Emlen-Oring model for mating system evolution, showing that polygyny and the opportunity for sexual selection are greatest when nests are large and females arrive asynchronously. This demonstrates that sexual selection can depend on resource distribution even if all individuals can obtain similar quality resources.
