revised_title: 'The Dual Nature of Membrane Potential Increase in Sodium/Potassium Exchange Pump Activity in Skeletal Muscle Fibers'
semantic_tags:
  - Membrane potential
  - Sodium-potassium pump
  - Skeletal muscle fibers
  - Electrogenic properties
  - Unstirred layer
tldr: The authors conducted experiments on frog skeletal muscle fibers to study the membrane potential increase associated with the sodium/potassium exchange pump activity. They discovered that the membrane potential increase has two components: one directly related to the electrogenic mode of pump action and the other due to potassium depletion in the lumen of the T-tubular system. The authors estimated the extent of this depletion and provided insights into the underlying mechanisms.
