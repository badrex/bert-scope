tldr: The author presents a crystallographic study of the monoclinic double sulphates containing ammonium. They describe the five remaining double sulphates in the series with R as ammonium and M as nickel, cobalt, manganese, copper, and cadmium. The study includes measurements of the crystals, comparison of axial angles and axial ratios, and an analysis of molecular volumes. The author also discusses the optical properties of the crystals and their cleavage.
