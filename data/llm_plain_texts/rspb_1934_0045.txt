tldr: The authors analyzed the oxygen to iron ratio in oxychlorocruorin, a respiratory pigment found in Spirographis, and determined that one molecule of labile oxygen corresponds to one atom of iron. They also calculated the total amount of oxygen that can be carried by the chlorocruorin in Spirographis blood, which is 6.0 cm³ per gram of worm.
