tldr: The article discusses the ligand-dependent interaction of nuclear receptors with potential transcriptional intermediary factors (mediators). The authors describe the isolation and characterization of two novel mouse proteins, TIF1 and mSUG1, which interact with the ligand-binding domain of nuclear receptors in a ligand-dependent manner. These interactions may play a role in the regulation of gene expression and the transcriptional activity of nuclear receptors.
