tldr: This article presents a series of experiments on the perception of sound direction and the influence of phase differences between vibrations at the two ears. The authors found that phase differences help determine the apparent direction of sound, with the sound appearing on the side with the more advanced phase. They also proposed a theory explaining the observed effects, suggesting that phase differences may act by creating differences in sound intensities inside the ears.
