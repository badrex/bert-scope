tldr: This article explores the direction assumed by plants during their growth, specifically focusing on tendril curling, stem bending towards light, and leaf orientation. The author conducts experiments to understand the mechanisms behind these phenomena and concludes that they are not the result of physical attraction or repulsion. Instead, they are due to vital irritability, endosmose, and the influence of light on leaf orientation. The blue light spectrum appears to have the most significant impact on these processes.
