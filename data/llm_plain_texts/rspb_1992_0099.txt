tldr: This study examines the limited MHC polymorphism in southern elephant seals and its implications for MHC evolution and marine mammal population biology. The research shows that two populations of southern elephant seals have low DNA restriction fragment length polymorphism at MHC loci compared to terrestrial mammals. This low polymorphism cannot be explained by low genome-wide diversity or reproductive-based selection pressure. Instead, it can be explained by diminished exposure to pathogenic selection pressure compared to terrestrial mammals, which may make marine mammal populations more susceptible to occasional pathogen-induced mass mortalities.
