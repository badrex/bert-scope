tldr: The authors studied the oxidation of gaseous formaldehyde and found that it can be described by a mechanism involving hydrogen atoms, similar to the hydrogen/oxygen reaction. They discovered that reactions (1) and (2) occur concurrently in the gas phase, with reaction (2) predominating, and that these reactions are coupled with an induced decomposition. This observation is not explained by previous proposed mechanisms but is readily interpreted by the new scheme presented.
