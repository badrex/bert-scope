tldr: The study investigates the relationship between the Acanthocephalan parasite Moniliformis and laboratory rats, focusing on the impact of different diets on the infection course and parasite growth. The researchers found that the survival, growth, and reproduction of Moniliformis depend on the availability of glucose from the host's diet. Rats fed on diets with starch showed better parasite growth and survival rates compared to those on carbohydrate-free diets.
