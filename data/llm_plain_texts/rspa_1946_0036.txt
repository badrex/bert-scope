tldr: The authors develop a diffraction theory for the Foucault test, which is widely used for testing astronomical mirrors and other high-quality optical systems. The theory covers errors of arbitrary form and amount, allowing for better understanding and prediction of the appearance of mirrors under test. This advanced theory helps improve the estimation of the test's sensitivity and its applications in determining focal position and detecting primary spherical aberration.
