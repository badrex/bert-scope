tldr: The authors studied the effect of an applied electric field on the oxidation rate of zinc and tungsten. They found that the electric field influences the growth rate of the oxide layer, and the direction of the effect depends on the polarity of the applied potential. The results suggest that the transition in rate-controlling species during the tarnishing reaction is accompanied by a change in the growth law of the oxide layer.
