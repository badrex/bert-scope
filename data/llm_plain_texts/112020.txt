tldr: The authors, Julius PlÃ¼cker and S. W. Hittorf, conducted experiments to study the spectra of ignited gases and vapors, focusing on the different spectra of the same elementary gaseous substances. They discovered that certain elements, like nitrogen, sulfur, and selenium, exhibit multiple spectra when heated at different temperatures or under different conditions. The authors also observed unique spectra for various gases, such as hydrogen, oxygen, and chlorine, and discussed the potential reasons behind these findings.
