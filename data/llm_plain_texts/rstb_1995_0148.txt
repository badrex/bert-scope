tldr: This study examines the physiology and pharmacology of oviducts in oviparous elasmobranch fish, specifically Raja and Scyliorhinus species. The oviducts play a crucial role in sperm transport and egg-laying. The research focuses on the effects of various substances, such as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT), adrenaline, noradrenaline, substance P, and acetylcholine, on the contractions of the oviduct muscles. The findings provide insights into the differences in sperm transport and egg-laying mechanisms in the two species.
