tldr: The author conducted experiments to investigate the polarity of diamagnetic forces and the effects of induction. They used an instrument similar to the one used by M. Weber to verify his experiments and satisfy the conditions proposed by critics. The results showed that caution is needed when separating the effects of diamagnetism from those of ordinary induction in experiments.
