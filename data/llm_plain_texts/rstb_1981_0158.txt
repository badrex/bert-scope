tldr: This article explores the patterning and cellular division in ciliates, focusing on the formation of discontinuities and overlaps within single cells. The study examines the properties of ciliate surface patterns, particularly in Tetrahymena thermophila, and discusses the similarities between ciliate and multicellular animal patterning mechanisms. The research highlights the importance of longitudinal continuity in maintaining differences in cell patterns and the role of the fission zone in cellular subdivision, which is compared to segmentation in other organisms.
