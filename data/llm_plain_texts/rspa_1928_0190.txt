tldr: The authors investigate the mobility of ions in air and the transformation of positive ions, focusing on the effects of ozone and other factors such as alcohol vapors, carbon dioxide, and manganese dioxide. They find that ozone increases the rate of transformation of initial ions into final ions, while alcohol vapors have the opposite effect. The study provides insights into the behavior of ions in the atmosphere and the role of various factors in ion transformation.
