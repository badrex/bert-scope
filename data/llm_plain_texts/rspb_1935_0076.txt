tldr: The study investigates the effects of X-rays on mitosis in the spermatogonial divisions of the migratory locust, Locusta migratoria. The research shows that X-rays cause structural alterations in chromosomes and induce various chromosome abnormalities. The findings contribute to the understanding of the biological effects of radiation on living organisms.
