tldr: This article discusses the challenges and findings related to the evolution of the Precambrian crust. It explores the early stages of continental crust formation, the thermal regimes, the chemistry of the primitive crust, depositional environments, and the kinematics of the early Precambrian crust. The author also questions the applicability of plate tectonics to the early history of the Earth's crust.
