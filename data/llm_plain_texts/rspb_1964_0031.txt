tldr: The study investigates the utilization of glucose in the cat's brain and other organs. It shows that the metabolism of glucose in the brain is characterized by a relatively rapid incorporation of glucose carbon into amino acids. The findings suggest that the brain has a unique way of processing glucose compared to other organs.
