tldr: The authors, William Ramsay and Morris W. Travers, conducted experiments to examine the gaseous constituents of various mineral substances and natural waters. They discovered that certain minerals, such as malacone, contain both argon and helium. Additionally, they found that some mineral springs contain significant amounts of argon, which they separated from the water using a method described by Lord Rayleigh. This research contributed to the understanding of the composition of gases in the Earth's atmosphere and the identification of new elements.
