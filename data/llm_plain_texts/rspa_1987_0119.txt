tldr: The authors propose a model for the generation of Tollmien-Schlichting waves in the boundary layer of a flat plate by free-stream turbulence. They suggest that two harmonic components of the turbulent velocity spectrum can generate these waves through nonlinear interactions. Numerical calculations based on this model show that Tollmien-Schlichting waves can be generated with amplitudes similar to the disturbance amplitude in the free stream, at least for certain ranges of Reynolds number, wavenumber, and frequency.
