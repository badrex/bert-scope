tldr: The study investigates the distribution of collagen fibril diameters in various connective tissues and its relation to age and mechanical properties. The research finds that the mass-average diameter of collagen fibrils at maturity is generally larger than at birth, and the fibril distributions may be unimodal or bimodal depending on the tissue. A positive correlation is observed between the ultimate tensile strength of a connective tissue and the mass-average diameter of its collagen fibrils. The form of the collagen fibril diameter distribution is related to the mechanical properties of the tissue, such as tensile strength and elasticity.
