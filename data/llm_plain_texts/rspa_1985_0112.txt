tldr: The article investigates the existence and uniqueness of subsonic Stoneley waves in bonded anisotropic elastic half-spaces. It uses the interface impedance tensor to derive an existence criterion for Stoneley wave modes and proves that for a given configuration, either one or no subsonic Stoneley mode exists. The study is based on the properties of the half-space surface impedance tensor, which allows for a thorough understanding of the Stoneley wave problem.
