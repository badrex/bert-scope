tldr: This article explores the role of nonlinear critical layers in boundary layer transition, focusing on the interaction between pairs of oblique instability modes. The author uses asymptotic methods to describe the nonlinear self-interaction within critical layers and discusses the physical implications of the resulting integro-differential equations. The study provides insights into the complex phenomena of boundary layer transition and the development of turbulence in fluid flows.
