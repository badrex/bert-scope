tldr: 'The author recalculates and simplifies the electric capacity coefficients of two spheres using Laplace's equation and Maxwell's series formulae. They provide a table of numerical values and discuss the application of these coefficients in practical laboratory work. Additionally, the author presents a simplified formula for calculating the capacity of a sphere near an infinite conducting plane.'
