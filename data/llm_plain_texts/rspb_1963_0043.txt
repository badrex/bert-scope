tldr: The study investigates the effects of 8-azaguanine, a purine analogue, on the growth and metabolism of isolated pea root tips in sterile culture. The results show that 8-azaguanine inhibits cell division while slightly increasing cell expansion. It is incorporated into the ribonucleic acid (RNA) of the root but not significantly into the DNA. The synthesis of protein, RNA, and DNA is inhibited to the same extent, and the activity of four enzymes is reduced. The researchers suggest that the incorporation of 8-azaguanine into a specific RNA component may block or alter a specific synthetic requirement for cell division.
