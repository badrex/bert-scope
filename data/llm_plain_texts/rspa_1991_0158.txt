tldr: This article explores the fractal dimensions and spectra of interfaces in turbulence, focusing on the self-similar structure and properties of convoluted surfaces. The authors demonstrate how these interfaces can be analyzed using various methods, including fractal analysis, and discuss the implications for understanding and modeling processes within interfaces of small but finite thickness.
