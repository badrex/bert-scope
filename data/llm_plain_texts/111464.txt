tldr: The author discusses the interior melting of ice and how pressure affects its melting point. They explain that when pressure is applied to ice, pores filled with liquid water form, and the melting point is lowered. This phenomenon is demonstrated through experiments and has implications for understanding the behavior of ice in glaciers and other natural settings.
