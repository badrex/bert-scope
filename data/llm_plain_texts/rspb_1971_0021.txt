tldr: 'The study examines the Flandrian pollen zones at Red Moss, Lancashire, and dates the major changes in post-glacial vegetation patterns. Using radiocarbon measurements, the researchers define a sequence of pollen assemblage zones and compare them with other dated sequences in north-west Europe. The findings provide insights into the synchroneity of vegetation changes and migration, succession, or climatic factors affecting the region.'
