tldr: The authors studied the structure and absorption spectrum of water molecules. They found that water has two main absorption bands in the infra-red region and suggested that these bands are connected to the linkings of the oxygen and hydrogen atoms. They also calculated the ratio of the wavelengths of these bands and tested their model numerically on three independent points.
