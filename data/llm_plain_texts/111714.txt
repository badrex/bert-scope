tldr: The author, A.W. Hofmann, conducted experiments on the phosphorus bases, specifically the methyl- and methylene series. He discovered new compounds and studied their reactions, solubility, and properties. The research involved the synthesis of various phosphorus compounds, including bromides, iodides, and platinum salts, and provided insights into their chemical behavior and potential applications.
