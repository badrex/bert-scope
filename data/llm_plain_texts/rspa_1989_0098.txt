tldr: The authors measured the density of light and heavy water vapor from 150 to 500°C to determine the second and third virial coefficients, which provide information about the forces between water molecules. The study improves the accuracy of steam turbine operations and helps in understanding the behavior of water in reactors as a moderator and heat-transfer agent. The findings also contribute to the study of water's fundamental properties.
