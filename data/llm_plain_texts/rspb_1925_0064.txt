tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the lactic acid and glycogen content in mammalian cardiac and skeletal muscles. They found that the heart has only one-fourth the glycogen content of skeletal muscle and that the stimulation maximum in the heart is only 22% of the total possible production, whereas skeletal muscle utilizes 42% of the lactic acid precursor present. This suggests that the heart has more lactic acid precursor in the form of hexose phosphate or another related compound than skeletal muscle.
