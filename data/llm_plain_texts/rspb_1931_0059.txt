tldr: The authors investigate the effects of coleoptile tips on plant geotropism and growth. They find that coleoptile tips cause root stumps to curve downwards and retard their growth, while accelerating the growth of coleoptile stumps. This discovery sheds light on how plants respond to gravity and how different parts of the plant are affected by growth substances.
