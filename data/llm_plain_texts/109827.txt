tldr: 'The author, David Brewster, investigates the laws that regulate the polarization of light by reflection from transparent bodies. He discovers that the angle of incidence at which maximum polarization occurs is related to the index of refraction. This is known as Brewster's Law. Brewster also explains how this law applies to reflection from the joint surface of two media, polarization by a plate of glass, and the origin of unpolarized light. He further discusses the potential applications of these findings in various circumstances.'
