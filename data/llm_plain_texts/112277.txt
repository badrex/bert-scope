revised_title: 'On the Absorption of Gases by Charcoal: Elective Nature and Attraction'

  - Charcoal properties
  - Elective nature
tldr: The author, Dr. R. Angus Smith, studied the absorption of gases by charcoal and found that charcoal selectively absorbs oxygen while not absorbing hydrogen, nitrogen, or carbonic acid. Charcoal's absorption power varies depending on its quality, with animal charcoal having a higher capacity to unite with oxygen than wood-charcoal. The study also explores the elective nature of porous bodies and the role of attraction in gas absorption.
