tldr: The author investigates the effect of mountain masses on the apparent astronomical latitude of stations in geodetic surveys. They conclude that the attraction of mountain masses, as computed on the theory of gravitation, is greater than necessary to explain the observed anomalies. The author suggests that the earth's crust floats on a layer of dense lava, and the weight of elevated land is supported by a downward projection of the crust into the lava.
