tldr: The author investigates the development of decapod crustaceans, focusing on the progression from the Zoea larval form to the adult Decapod. They argue that the development is gradual and that no sudden metamorphosis occurs, debunking the common belief among naturalists. The study is conducted on the species Carcinus llinas, with additional evidence from other species.
