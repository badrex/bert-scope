tldr: The author investigates the effect of fluid compressibility on the evolution of the homogeneous thermal explosion problem. They find that non-zero flow divergence rates in a compressible atmosphere can significantly affect the local distribution of thermal energy within the fluid, which is crucial for understanding the behavior of chemically evolving atmospheres.
