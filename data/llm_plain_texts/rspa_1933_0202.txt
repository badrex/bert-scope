tldr: The authors conducted experiments using secondary cathode rays and X-ray spectroscopy to measure atomic constants. They used a magnetic spectrograph to analyze the energies of the secondary cathode rays and compared their results with X-ray spectral data. The study aimed to improve the understanding of fundamental atomic constants and provide a more accurate measurement of atomic properties.
