tldr: The study investigates the K+ current induced by isoprenaline acting on (3-adrenergic receptors in Xenopus laevis oocytes. The research finds that this current is mediated by an intracellular rise of cAMP. Acetylcholine produces a long-lasting inhibition of the isoprenaline current, which is not seen in the presence of atropine. The results support the hypothesis of the involvement of cAMP in the catecholamine-induced increase of K+ conductance in oocytes and describe the inhibition of this p-adrenergic response by muscarinic agents.
