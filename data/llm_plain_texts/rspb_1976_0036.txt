tldr: This study analyzes inversion polymorphisms in two species of the melanogaster subgroup of the genus Drosophila, Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans. The researchers analyzed chromosomes from 67 collections of D. melanogaster and 27 collections of D. simulans, originating from various regions worldwide. They found that 53 inversions are known in D. melanogaster, with 7 widespread and 43 endemic. No inversions were found in D. simulans. The research raises several interesting questions about the relationships within the melanogaster subgroup and the origins of these species.
