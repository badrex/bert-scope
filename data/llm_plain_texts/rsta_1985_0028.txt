revised_title: Geochemical Processes in Buried Sediments: Diagenetic Non-Silicate Minerals and Kinetic Considerations
semantic_tags:
  - Geochemistry
  - Diagenesis
  - Sedimentary rocks
  - Mineral precipitation
  - Pore-water chemistry
tldr: This article explores the geochemical processes that occur in buried sediments, focusing on diagenetic non-silicate minerals and their formation. The authors discuss the role of organic matter in driving reactions and the importance of burial rate and pore-water chemistry in controlling the sequence of reactions. They also examine the characteristics of diagenetic minerals and their potential to provide information about the environment of growth.
