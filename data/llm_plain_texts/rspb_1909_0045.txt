tldr: The author's study of the mollusk Crepidula fornicata reveals that it exhibits protandric hermaphroditism, where individuals start as males, then transition to hermaphrodites, and finally become females. This discovery sheds light on the chain-like formations these creatures form and their complex life cycle.
