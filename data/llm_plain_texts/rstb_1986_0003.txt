tldr: The article discusses the evolution and dynamics of transposable elements in DNA sequences, focusing on their impact on genomic locations and the need for new population genetics theories to understand their evolution. The author explores various models and predictions related to transposable element frequency spectra, identity coefficients, and the time to a common ancestor for transposable elements from different genomic locations. The role of transposable elements in adaptive evolution is also considered, highlighting the importance of understanding the processes that lead to homogenization of these sequences.
