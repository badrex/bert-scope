tldr: This article explores the behavior of basic-ultrabasic silicate melts in the Earth's mantle and their relationship to the formation of metasomatic rocks and alkalic igneous rocks in the mantle lithosphere. The author emphasizes the connection between modally metasomatized rocks and dykes or veins indicative of melt injection. The study focuses on how the crystallization of metasomatic minerals is linked with the chemical evolution of melts injecting and percolating through peridotite, leading to the formation of continuous varieties of metasomatized rocks and melts.
