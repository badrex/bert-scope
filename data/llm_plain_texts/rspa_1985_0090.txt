tldr: The author explores the conformal properties of Lorentz metrics and their embeddings in space-time. They introduce the concept of an 'ideal boundary' to analyze the conformal types of Lorentz manifolds and demonstrate how it can be used to determine whether a manifold can be conformally embedded in the Minkowski space. The study has implications for understanding the structure of space-time and the behavior of linear hyperbolic operators in dimension 2.
