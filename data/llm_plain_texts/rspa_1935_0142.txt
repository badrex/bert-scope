tldr: The author discusses the nature of cosmic rays and their corpuscular nature. They present evidence from various experiments and observations, including ionization measurements, absorption curves, and magnetic field effects, to support the idea that at least part of the primary radiation is corpuscular. The author also proposes a continuous energy distribution of cosmic particles and explores the behavior of high-energy particles in the atmosphere.
