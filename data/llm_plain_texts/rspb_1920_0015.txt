revised_title: 'The Development of Photosynthetic Activity in Young Leaves'
semantic_tags:
  - Photosynthesis
  - Chlorophyll development
  - Plant growth
  - Oxygen production
  - Plant respiration
tldr: The authors conducted experiments on young leaves to study the development of photosynthetic activity and its relation to chlorophyll development. They found that the assimilatory power of young leaves depends more on the age of the leaf than its color. The assimilation increases with time after greening, even when kept in the dark, suggesting that factors other than chlorophyll content, leaf area, or respiration are responsible for this increase.
