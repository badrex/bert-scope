tldr: Researchers designed and studied coiled-coil peptides to understand their self-association behavior. They found that some peptides form a non-cooperative monomer-dimer-trimer equilibrium, and investigated the factors that cause the peptides to form trimers instead of dimers. This work led to the development of a corrected helix thermodynamic scale and provided insights into protein folding and structure.
