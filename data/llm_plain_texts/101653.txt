tldr: The author, Robert Boyle, describes a new, simple, and affordable instrument for examining coins and metals. The instrument can easily differentiate between true and counterfeit guineas and can also be used to examine other types of coins and metals. The device works by comparing the weight of the object in the air and in water, allowing for the detection of any differences in density or specific gravity. This instrument can be a valuable tool for goldsmiths, buyers, and pewterers to ensure the authenticity and quality of their coins and metals.
