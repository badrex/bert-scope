tldr: The author investigates the effects of Röntgen rays on dielectrics and their ability to discharge electricity. They found that Röntgen rays can rapidly discharge electrification in both positively and negatively charged bodies. The author also discovered that these rays can produce noticeable effects on charged plates even after passing through thick materials like zinc plates. This research helps in understanding the behavior of Röntgen rays and their potential applications in various fields.
