tldr: The authors investigated the nerve supply to the dentine of human teeth and found that the dentine is richly supplied with nerves from the pulp. These nerves do not terminate at the inner margin of the dentine but enter the tubules of the tissue and extend to the enamel and cementum margins. The study provides evidence that sensation in the tooth is conducted by nerve fibers, similar to other tissues in the body.
