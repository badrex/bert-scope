tldr: The study investigates the effect of high pressure on glycine- and kainate-sensitive receptor channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The results show that the action of glycine is highly pressure-sensitive, while the action of kainate remains unaffected. These findings suggest that high pressure may block the action of glycine by directly affecting the receptor-ion channel complex.
