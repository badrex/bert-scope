tldr: This study investigates the diffraction of weak blast waves and resolves the von Neumann paradox. The experiments reveal a fundamental difference between weak and strong shock diffraction, and by considering the attenuating effect of the corner signal, the von Neumann theory can be modified to better align with experimental data. This research provides a better understanding of blast wave phenomena and contributes to the development of more accurate theoretical models.
