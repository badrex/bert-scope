tldr: Dr. Richard Lower conducted an experiment to alter the breathing of a dog by cutting its diaphragm nerves, resulting in a similar breathing pattern as a wind-broken horse. This experiment demonstrated the importance of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles in respiration and how their dysfunction can lead to respiratory issues in animals.
