tldr: The Joint Air-Sea Interaction Project (JASIN) 1978 was an international experiment that aimed to study the interaction of the atmospheric and oceanic boundary layers with larger-scale motions of the sea and air. The experiment took place in the North Rockall Trough off the west coast of Scotland and involved 14 ships and 3 aircraft, with over 50 teams of investigators from 9 countries. The project focused on observing physical processes causing mixing and quantifying aspects of the heat and momentum budgets in the oceanic and atmospheric boundary layers.
