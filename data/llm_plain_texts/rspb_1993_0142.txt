tldr: The study investigates the effects of a novel antagonist, MCPG, on metabotropic glutamate receptors in hippocampal CA3 pyramidal cells. The results show that MCPG effectively inhibits responses mediated by these receptors, confirming that glutamate release from presynaptic terminals can modulate postsynaptic properties by activating metabotropic glutamate receptors. This finding has implications for understanding the role of these receptors in the induction of long-term potentiation.
