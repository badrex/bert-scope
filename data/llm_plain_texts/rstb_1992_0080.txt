tldr: This study examines the morphology and development of aragonitic crossed-lamellar microstructure in various mollusk species using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The research reveals that although the basic structure of the microstructure is similar across species, there is a significant degree of variation in size and form. The crystallographic orientation of the crystals in the different morphological units is determined using electron diffraction patterns. This increased understanding of the mollusk shell microstructure may lead to a better comprehension of the process of shell secretion.
