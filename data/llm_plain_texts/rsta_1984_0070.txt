tldr: This paper presents a formal framework that unifies logic, set theory, and programming languages. It transforms the activity of program construction into proof construction within the realm of logic and set theory. The paper introduces a programming notation that has equivalent counterparts in logic and set theory, allowing for a mechanizable foundation for proof construction. The authors propose making programs computable, but not necessarily executable, to bridge the gap between program specification and content.
