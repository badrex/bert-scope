tldr: The authors studied the Zeeman effect in the band spectrum of helium. They observed the effect in various types of bands and found that the degree of uncoupling varied with the quantum numbers n, A, and K. The results showed a general correspondence with the uncoupling effect as revealed by other criteria, providing insights into the behavior of the Zeeman effect in helium bands.
