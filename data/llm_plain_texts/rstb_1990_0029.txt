tldr: 'This article discusses the effects of low temperatures on living organisms, focusing on water management and the mechanisms of cold tolerance and resistance. It explains the distinction between chill and freezing, the role of undercooling in freeze resistance, and the importance of water's physical and chemical properties in biological processes. The article also explores the impact of low temperatures on protein stability and the potential for cold-induced transitions in proteins.'
