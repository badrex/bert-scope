tldr: The authors present a new experimental method to study cataphoresis and confirm Smoluchowski's equation. They use a glass fibre suspension to measure the cataphoretic velocity and investigate the flow of liquid through a pipe of rectangular cross-section. The results support Smoluchowski's equation, providing insights into the understanding of cataphoresis and its applications.
