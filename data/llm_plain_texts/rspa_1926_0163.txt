tldr: The author presents a general form of statistical mechanics that encompasses various types of assemblies, including ideal gases, crystals, and radiation. The theory is based on Schrödinger's equation and considers assemblies with multiple types of recognizably distinct systems. The author also discusses the calculation of the equilibrium state, external reactions, entropy, and temperature in this new form of statistical mechanics.
