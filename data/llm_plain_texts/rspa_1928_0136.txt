tldr: The authors studied the electrolytic behavior of thin films and the areas of catalytically active surfaces. They measured the accessible area of various surfaces, including silver, mercury, and platinum, by observing the quantity of hydrogen deposited on the cathode. The results showed that the catalytic activity of silver atoms is several thousand times that of mercury, and the presence of relatively few platinum atoms on a mercury surface greatly increases the activity. The authors also investigated the effect of different treatments, such as activation, annealing, rolling, and electroplating, on the area and catalytic activity of metals.
