tldr: The author's study found that sexual ornamentation in male roach fish can reveal information about their parasites. Two characteristics of the ornamentation could be used to differentiate between males infected with different parasites, and the number of parasites correlates negatively with the expression of other ornamental characters. This discovery suggests that females could potentially use a male's ornamentation to gather information about his health and choose a mate accordingly.
