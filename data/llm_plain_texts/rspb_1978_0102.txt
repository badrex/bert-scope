tldr: The author examines frog motor endplates using a new electron microscopy technique involving albumin treatment and osmium tetroxide fixation. They discover a small proportion of endplate axonal ramifications with microtubules clothed in synaptic vesicles focused on the presynaptic membrane, particularly at active zones. The author discusses the possibility that microtubules are involved in the translocation of synaptic vesicles to the active zone.
