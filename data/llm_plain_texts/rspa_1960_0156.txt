tldr: The authors studied the transformation from disorder to partial order in α-brass by quenching and slow cooling. They found that specimens quenched from 600°C reordered rapidly below 160°C, while specimens quenched from 300°C had a slower reordering process. The different behavior after quenching from 600°C is attributed to a higher concentration of quenched-in vacancies. The results indicate that quenched-in vacancies and short-range order both contribute to the changes in properties of quenched α-brass.
