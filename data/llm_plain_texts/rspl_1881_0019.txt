tldr: The author conducted experiments with whirled anemometers to study the effects of lutidine on cardiac and muscular tissue. They discovered that lutidine increases the tonicity of both cardiac and voluntary muscular tissue, slows the heart's rate, and arrests the inhibitory power of the vagus nerve. Additionally, lutidine was found to be successfully antagonistic to strychnine in its action on the spinal cord.
