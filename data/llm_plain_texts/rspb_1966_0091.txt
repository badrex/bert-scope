tldr: The authors studied the amino acid sequence of heavy chains in rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) to understand the structure and potential differences that may be associated with antibody specificity. They found that a considerable portion of the heavy chain has a regular sequence common to all antibodies, but also discovered interesting aspects of heavy chain structure, such as the amino terminal region and the similarity between Fc fragment and Bence-Jones proteins.
