tldr: Researchers measured the electrical conductivity of samples of magnesiowustite-perovskite assemblage under high pressure and temperature conditions to study the Earth's lower mantle. They found that the conductivity was affected by pressure and oxygen fugacity, with the activation energy decreasing with increasing pressure and oxygen fugacity. The results confirm that the electrical conductivity of the lower mantle is of the order of 1, and provide better constraints for extrapolating experimental results to the conditions of the Earth's lower mantle.
