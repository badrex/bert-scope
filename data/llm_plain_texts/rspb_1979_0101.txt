tldr: The article investigates the effects of substance P on neurons of the myenteric plexus of the guinea-pig small intestine. It found that substance P increases the firing rate of myenteric neurons and causes a dose-dependent membrane depolarization. The study suggests that substance P may play a role in the intestine's function and could be a potential neuromuscular transmitter.
