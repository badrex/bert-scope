tldr: The study investigates the phenomenon of foetal retrogression and its impact on pregnancy mortality in mice. It also examines the sex incidence of foetal death resulting in re-absorption. The research finds that the normal elimination of fertilized ova amounts to 10.8 per 100 normal foetuses. However, if conception occurs when the uterus is disturbed by a recent parturition, the loss increases to 17.6 per 100 foetuses, and when these unfavorable conditions are intensified by prolonged suckling of the first litter, the elimination ratio rises to 23.1. The study provides insights into the impact of environmental factors on embryonic elimination and the sex ratio of embryos and foetuses.
