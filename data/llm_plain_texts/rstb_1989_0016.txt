tldr: This article presents a model for integrated photosynthesis in cells and leaves, focusing on the role of the enzyme Rubisco and the effects of various factors such as light intensity, carbon dioxide concentration, and temperature. The authors discuss the importance of understanding photosynthesis for predicting plant growth and optimizing resource allocation within leaves. They also highlight the potential challenges in interpreting gas exchange measurements and the need for accurate modeling to better understand the underlying processes.
