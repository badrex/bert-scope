tldr: The author investigates the association between beta-rays and alpha-particle groups in thorium C decay. They confirm that gamma-rays are emitted after the disintegration of thorium C, supporting Gamow's hypothesis that the thorium C nucleus can be initially formed with alpha-particles in the ground state and sometimes disintegrate, leaving the product nucleus excited.
