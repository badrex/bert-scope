tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the free energies and heat contents of hydrogen chloride in water-ethyl alcohol solutions. They determined the electromotive forces of cells containing these solutions and used the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation to calculate the heat content changes. The results provide insights into the interaction between ions and solvent molecules in mixed solvents.
