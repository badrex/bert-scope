tldr: The study investigates the transmission of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and scrapie to mice, examining strain variation and the species barrier. The results show that BSE transmitted easily to mice, producing uniform disease characteristics. In contrast, scrapie transmissions were more variable, suggesting that the strains of agent causing BSE and scrapie are different. This supports the idea that BSE may have originated from sheep scrapie but with selected variant strains due to the high temperatures involved in rendering and accidental passage through cattle.
