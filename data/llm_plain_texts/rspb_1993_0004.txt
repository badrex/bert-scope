tldr: The article demonstrates that nerve growth factor (NGF) prevents the functional and anatomical changes caused by monocular deprivation in the rat visual cortex and lateral geniculate nucleus. By supplying NGF, the shrinkage of neurons in the deprived laminae of the lateral geniculate nucleus is prevented, suggesting a role for NGF in the plasticity of the geniculo-cortical pathway.
