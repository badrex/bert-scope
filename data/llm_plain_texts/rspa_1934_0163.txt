tldr: The authors conducted experiments using radium to study the protons emitted from certain elements when bombarded by alpha particles. They used electrical counters to analyze the protons and developed a method to count them in the presence of strong beta radiation. Their findings contributed to the understanding of the structure of nuclei of light elements.
