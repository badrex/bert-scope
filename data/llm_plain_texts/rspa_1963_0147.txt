tldr: The article investigates three-dimensional punch and crack problems in elastostatics, focusing on the indentation of an elastic half-space by two circular punches and the opening of two or more coplanar penny-shaped cracks in an infinite solid. The problems are shown to be governed by infinite sets of Fredholm integral equations of the second kind, which can be solved approximately by iteration when the spacing between the circular regions is sufficiently large compared with their radii.
