tldr: The author explores flat space-times with gravitational fields and demonstrates that Einstein's field equations admit solutions with empty regions that are locally flat but have non-trivial gravitational fields. Two examples are given, one with cylindrical symmetry and another with a toroidal source, showing how these fields can differ from one another and their implications for space-time geometry.
