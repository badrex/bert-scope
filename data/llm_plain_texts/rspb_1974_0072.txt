tldr: The authors discovered that non-heated rabbit serum causes massive transmitter release from motor nerve endings. This effect is not observed after heating the serum, which is usually done to destroy complement. The study suggests that serum may act on nerve terminals by a mechanism involving the complement system in the absence of antibodies. The findings could have implications for understanding the composition of serum and the action of the complement system.
