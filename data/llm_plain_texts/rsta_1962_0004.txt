tldr: This paper presents a complete method for parametrizing neighbourhood manifolds and their aggregates in projective space. The models are irreducible and non-singular, and their points are in one-to-one correspondence with the sequences in the appropriate aggregates. The geometrical properties of these models are studied in detail, providing a complete geometrical description of the base and intersection theory on them.
