tldr: The article presents a general approach to determine defects in clay minerals using X-ray crystallography. The method involves creating a structural model that takes into account various types of defects and their distribution, then calculating a synthetic pattern based on the model. By modifying the values of characteristic parameters, the theoretical diagram is fitted to the experimental one, considering factors like particle orientation, coherent domain sizes, and apparatus perturbations. This method is useful for recognizing the kind, proportion, and distribution of structural defects in clays.
