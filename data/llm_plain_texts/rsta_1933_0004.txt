tldr: The authors developed a new apparatus to determine the relationship between light wave-lengths and fundamental length standards. The apparatus allows for accurate measurements of length using wave-lengths of light, which can be used to replace the current Imperial Standard Yard. The authors also discuss the advantages of using end-gauges made of hardened steel for length standards and the possibility of defining the ultimate standard of length by reference to wave-lengths in vacuum.
