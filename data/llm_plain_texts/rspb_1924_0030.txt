tldr: The author studied the dimensions of the labyrinth in various animals and found that the internal structures of the cochlea and semi-circular canals are highly correlated with each other. This correlation is maintained in mammals and birds, suggesting a typical form that varies in scale with the length of the head and body. The author also found that the external diameter of the superior canal can be used as a representative measurement for the canals.
