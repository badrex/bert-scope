tldr: Researchers studied hemoglobin variants in 202 irus macaques using starch-gel electrophoresis. They discovered two major hemoglobin variants, one that forms molecular aggregates and two minor components. The study found that the minor component may be the product of a mutated duplicate of the -locus. The researchers also discussed the population genetics of these variant hemoglobins and the possible role of simian malaria in their evolution.
