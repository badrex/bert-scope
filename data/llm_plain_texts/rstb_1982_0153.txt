tldr: This article discusses the complex mechanisms of anion transport in the colon, focusing on the absorption of organic anions like acetate, butyrate, and propionate. The author explains that the colon plays a significant role in the conservation of inorganic ions and water, and that the anion transport mechanisms are essential for understanding cation movements. The study also highlights the importance of the colon in the absorption and secretion of anions, and the various factors that can influence these processes.
