tldr: The authors conducted experiments on 46 simple cells in the cat's visual cortex to analyze their receptive-field profiles. They found that Gabor functions, which are the product of a Gaussian envelope and a sinusoid, provide a good description of the receptive-field profiles to a first approximation. However, their analysis does not support the notion that simple cells generally fit into even- and odd-symmetric categories.
