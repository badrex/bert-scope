tldr: This article investigates the potential and stability of vortex rings and annular fluids, with a focus on the stability of rotating fluids and the potential of anchor rings. The author also explores the potential of a ring of elliptic cross-section and the motion of multiple vortex rings on the same axis. The findings have implications for understanding Saturn's rings and the behavior of fluids in various contexts.
