tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the emission of electrons and adsorption of water vapor on activated charcoal at low gas pressures. They found that electron currents were independent of gas pressure and that the apparent temperature of emitted electrons remained consistent. The experiments provided further understanding of electron emission and adsorption processes under low pressure conditions.
