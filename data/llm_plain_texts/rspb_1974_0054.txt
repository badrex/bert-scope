tldr: The study examines the uptake and utilization of organic compounds, such as glucose, glycerol, and alanine, by symbiont-free hosts like anemones and turbellarian larvae. The findings indicate that these compounds are rapidly assimilated and metabolized to provide energy and stable cell constituents. The research contributes to understanding the nutritional basis of algal-invertebrate symbiosis and the role of dissolved nutrients in marine invertebrates' nutrition.
