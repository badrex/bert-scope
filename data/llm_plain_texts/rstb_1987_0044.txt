tldr: The Beatrice oilfield development required thorough environmental planning and monitoring to minimize its impact on the surrounding area, which is of significant ecological and nature-conservation importance. The monitoring program involved various studies, including ornithological research, intertidal monitoring, sublittoral studies, and investigations of marine growth. The results showed that the development and operation of the Beatrice field did not damage the marine environment and resources of the Moray Firth, with only localized environmental impacts observed beneath and near the drilling platforms.
