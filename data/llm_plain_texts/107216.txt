tldr: The author, William Herschel, investigates the cause of colored concentric rings and other appearances between object glasses. He examines prismatic experiments and explains that there are two primary prismatic bows: a blue one and a red one. The author also discusses the differences between the red and blue bows and how they are produced through critical separation.
