tldr: The authors study the formation and characteristics of marscoite and related rocks in the Western Red Hills complex on the Isle of Skye. They describe the different stages of intrusion and the mixing of basic and acid magmas, which led to the formation of marscoite. The authors also discuss the origin of the epigranites in the Hebridean igneous province and propose a mechanism for their formation through the mixing of different magmas.
