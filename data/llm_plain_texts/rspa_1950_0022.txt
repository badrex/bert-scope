tldr: The authors discuss the validity of the results and theoretical implications of their study on copolymerization, focusing on the rate coefficients for the copolymerization of styrene and methyl methacrylate. They analyze the effect of chain transfer, internal filter effects, and the combination of radicals on the rate of initiation and termination reactions. The study provides insights into the factors influencing the interaction of radicals and the role of monomer composition in the copolymerization process.
