tldr: The author introduces a general theory of mathematical form and systems, focusing on the treatment of mathematical concepts as connected units and their various aspects. The text explores the distinction between units, pairs, and collections, as well as the graphical representation of systems using colored spots, lines, and other graphical units. The author also discusses the importance of tabular representation in understanding the form of systems and the relationship between different aspects of collections.
