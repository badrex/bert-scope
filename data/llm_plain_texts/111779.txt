tldr: The author conducted a series of experiments to study the digestion of starch and starch-containing foods using microscopy and chemical tests. They discovered the structure of starch granules and the changes they undergo during digestion. The findings support the theories of Leuwenhoeck and Quekett regarding the structure of starch granules and provide insights into the role of saliva, gastric juice, bile, pancreatic juice, and intestinal mucus in the digestion process.
