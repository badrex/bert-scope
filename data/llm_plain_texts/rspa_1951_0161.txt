tldr: The authors studied the dielectric behavior of vapors adsorbed on activated silica gel, measuring the increase in capacity of a test containing porous activated silica upon the admission of vapors like water, ethyl chloride, and butane. They found evidence of two types of films established for adsorbates butane and ethyl chloride, with the first type having a density close to the liquid state and the second being a more dilute film. The study also discussed the computation of dielectric constants of adsorbed matter in such systems and provided a method for determining density values from dielectric data applicable in the case of non-polar adsorbates.
