tldr: The authors study the effects of variable diffusivity on the development of traveling waves in a class of reaction-diffusion equations. They analyze the behavior of the waves and provide a formal asymptotic solution to the initial boundary-value problem. The results have implications for understanding the dynamics of biological and chemical systems.
