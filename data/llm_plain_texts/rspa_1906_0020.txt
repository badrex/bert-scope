tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of high temperatures on radium emanation. They found that the activity of the emanation decreased temporarily after heating, but later recovered to its normal value. The results suggest that the rate of decay of one of the products, radium C, is affected by temperature. Further experiments are needed to determine the exact relationship between temperature and radioactive decay.
