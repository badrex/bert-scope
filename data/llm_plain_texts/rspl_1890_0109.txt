revised_title: On the Screening Effect of Electric and Magnetic Forces
semantic_tags:
  - Electromagnetic Screening
  - Electromagnetic Induction
  - Alternating Currents
  - Frequency Effects
  - Magnetic Force
tldr: The author investigates the screening effect of electric and magnetic forces on varying frequencies. They find that the screening effect is less for higher frequencies and that alternating electric currents distribute themselves similarly to static electrification in corresponding electrostatic arrangements. The author also discusses the screening effect of a rotating conducting sheet and its impact on magnetic action.
