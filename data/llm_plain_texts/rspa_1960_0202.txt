tldr: This article presents a study on one-dimensional overlap functions and their application to Auger recombination in semiconductors. The authors develop a theoretical model using the Kronig-Penney model and calculate the overlap integrals, which are essential for understanding the lifetime of excess carriers in semiconductors limited by the Auger recombination mechanism. The results show good agreement with experimental data for InSb, suggesting that the dominant recombination mechanism in InSb at elevated temperatures has been identified.
