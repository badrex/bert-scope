tldr: This article examines the fine structure of crustacean proprioceptors, specifically the thoracico-coxal organs in Carcinus, Pagurus, and Astacus. The muscular receptor and innervated elastic strands, type II arthropod proprioceptors, are studied in detail. The dendrites of these sensory fibers have a unique relationship with specialized connective tissue strings, which are associated with the proprioceptor muscles. The chordotonal organ, a type I arthropod proprioceptor, is also discussed, revealing its complex fine structure.
