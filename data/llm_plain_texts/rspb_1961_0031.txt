tldr: The study compares the properties of visual pigments in their natural cell environment and after extraction into digitonin solution. The adapted 'opal-glass' method allows for accurate characterization of light-absorbing properties in highly scattering visual-cell suspensions. The results show that there is no significant difference in the light-absorbing properties of visual pigments when extracted from their natural environment.
