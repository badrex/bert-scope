tldr: This article investigates the scattering of electromagnetic surface waves by dielectric spheroids. The authors find reflection and transmission coefficients for the scattering of the waves by a dielectric axisymmetric spheroid. They also explore the possibility of zero reflection of the incident wave mode and provide conditions for achieving this phenomenon.
