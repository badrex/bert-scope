tldr: The author, Henry Bence Jones, conducted experiments to determine if electricity could dissolve urinary calculi in dilute saline fluids. Using a solution of nitrate of potassa and a galvanic battery, he found that uric acid calculi could be dissolved at the temperature of the human body. This discovery could potentially aid in the treatment of urinary tract stones.
