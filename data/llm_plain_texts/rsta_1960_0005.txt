tldr: This article investigates the adsorption of surface-active materials at the oil/water interface and tests the electrical double-layer theory. The authors find that the equations derived from their theoretical treatment, which assume complete mobility of molecules in the interface, are followed by neutral and ionized adsorbed films. The study also reveals that deviations from the equations occur in specific conditions, such as short-chain compounds, high concentrations, and high electrolyte concentrations, suggesting that ionic size should be considered in the theoretical treatment.
