tldr: The author conducted experiments on torsion and flexure to determine the rigidities of malleable iron, cast iron, and copper rods. They used a unique apparatus and observed the rods' behavior under various conditions. The results provided valuable insights into the mechanical properties of these materials, including Young's modulus, rigidity, and Poisson's ratio.
