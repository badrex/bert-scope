tldr: The author conducted a series of chemical analyses on Rubia munjista, the East-Indian Madder, and discovered new dye substances. He found that munjistine and purpurine are the main colorants in munjeet, which have lower tinctorial power compared to the best madder. The author also identified a new substance called purpureine, which forms when purpurine is exposed to air and ammonia. This substance has unique properties and is similar to orceine.
