tldr: The authors derive complementary bivariational bounds on the quantity associated with linear equations in a Hilbert space, where the operator is self-adjoint. These bounds can be used to estimate when the solution of the equation cannot be found exactly and have applications in various fields, including integral equations, potential theory, and quantum-mechanical perturbation theory.
