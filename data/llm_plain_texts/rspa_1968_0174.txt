tldr: The authors present a method to predict the growth of tangential velocity profiles in axial flow through annuli with a rotating inner cylinder. The method, based on simplification and solution of the Stokes equations using Fourier-Bessel series, is more straightforward and requires fewer assumptions than previous techniques. The predictions are most accurate at high axial Reynolds numbers. This research has potential applications in advanced combustion systems and heat exchangers, where understanding fluid motion within the annulus is crucial for successful design.
