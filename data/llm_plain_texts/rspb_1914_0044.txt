tldr: The author presents a new theory that the glomerulus in the kidney acts as a propulsor, using blood pressure to create a pressure head that drives urine down the tubule. The author criticizes the filtration theory and provides evidence against it, including the concentration and constitution of dilute urine, the correlation between blood flow and urine secretion, and the behavior of the kidney after temporary asphyxiation. The author's new conception of glomerular function challenges the widely accepted filtration theory.
