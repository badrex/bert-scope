tldr: This article investigates the distribution of potential in thermionic tubes, specifically triodes and tetrodes. The authors develop a method to calculate the potential distribution and capacity coefficients for these devices, which can be used to determine the electron current and improve the understanding of their functioning. The study is based on the work of Maxwell and provides a more accurate analysis of the effect of image charges in these tubes.
