tldr: The author, William Clift, conducted experiments on fish to determine the influence of spinal marrow on the action of the heart. He found that the heart's action continued even after the brain and spinal marrow were destroyed, and that the muscles of the fish body could still contract four hours after the brain and heart were removed. The experiments showed that the spinal marrow had little effect on the heart's action.
