tldr: This study investigates the effects of rapid heat addition at the boundary of a confined gas, focusing on weak shock wave generation. The research examines the gas's behavior during the heating process and the development of weak shock waves. One-dimensional, unsteady solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations are obtained using perturbation methods, revealing that the shock strength is directly related to the duration of the initial boundary heating.
