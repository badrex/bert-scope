tldr: The authors explore the closest packing of equal circles on a sphere using techniques developed for determining the arrangement of atoms around a central atom. They discovered improved packings for values between 20-40 and found that many of these structures have lower symmetries than previously described. The packing density, defined as the fraction of the spherical surface enclosed by the circles, increases as the number of circles increases, but remains below the density for an infinite number of circles or a close-packed plane.
