tldr: This article discusses the molecular regulation of sexual development in plants, focusing on the processes of epigenetic imprinting and self-incompatibility. It also explores the role of growth regulators, such as gibberellic acid and cytokinins, in sex determination. The article highlights the variety of genetic control systems in plants, including X:autosome balance systems and sex chromosomes, and the importance of understanding these processes for modifying plant reproductive systems.
