tldr: In 1769, Daniel Harris observed the transit of Venus over the Sun from the Round Tower in Windsor Castle. His observations helped determine the longitude of Windsor Castle and contributed to the understanding of time measurement and astronomical events. Harris also discussed the challenges he faced during the observation, such as the wind affecting the telescope's view.
