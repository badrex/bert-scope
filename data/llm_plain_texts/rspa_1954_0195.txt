tldr: The author investigates the effects of a magnetic field and rotation on the thermal instability of a fluid layer heated from below. They find that both factors inhibit the onset of convection, and the critical Rayleigh number at which instability sets in depends on the parameters related to magnetic permeability, electrical conductivity, and kinematic viscosity. The study reveals unexpected features and complex behavior of the fluid under simultaneous magnetic field and rotation.
