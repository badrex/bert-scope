tldr: The author, William Cole, discovered a unique shellfish, the Purple Fish, on the coasts of Somerset and South Wales. He found that by extracting a white liquid from the shell, he could create a delicate, durable crimson dye for fine linen and silk. The dye changes color when exposed to sunlight, going through a sequence of green, sea-green, watchet blue, purplish red, and deep purple red. The author also observed the fish's ability to live in both water and air, clinging to the side of a vessel with a kind of lip.
