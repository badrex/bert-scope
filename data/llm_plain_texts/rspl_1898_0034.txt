tldr: The authors conducted a year-long study of phytoplankton in the Atlantic Ocean, collecting samples from various locations. They focused on the Coccospheres and Rhabdospheres, describing their structure and classifying them as unicellular algae. They compared these organisms with deep-sea deposits and geological coccoliths, establishing their identity. Additionally, they described new Peridiniaceas, observed diatoms and Cyanophyceae, and discovered a new species of Pyrocystis.
