tldr: This article presents a variational method for weak resonant wave interactions, focusing on capillary-gravity waves. The method simplifies the algebraic calculations and retains the two-time nature of the responses introduced by Benney. It provides a new approach to study resonant interactions and offers a more manageable way to analyze complex systems with multiple interaction terms.
