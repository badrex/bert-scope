tldr: The authors developed a new method to estimate the height of the ozone layer using photoelectric cells, which measure the relative intensities of two wavelengths absorbed differently by ozone. They discovered the "Umkehr Effect," where the ratio of the two wavelengths changes as the sun sets, allowing them to deduce the vertical distribution of ozone in the atmosphere.
