tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the changes blood undergoes when mixed with urine in the urinary bladder. They discovered that blood can form a firm coagulum with urine, and that the red blood cells do not dissolve in this coagulum. The presence of urine also prevents blood from becoming putrid. These findings provide new insights into the processes that occur in the human body during certain medical conditions.
