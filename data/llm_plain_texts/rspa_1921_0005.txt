tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the heat loss and internal energy of inflammable mixtures of coal-gas and air after explosion. They found that the heat loss occurs through radiation and conduction, and the internal energy can be estimated by considering the heat of combustion and heat loss to the walls of the containing vessel. The results help to understand the factors limiting the maximum pressures developed in gas explosions and improve the estimation of the internal energy of the exploded mixtures.
