tldr: This article explores the elastic properties of grain boundaries in materials science, focusing on the atomic structure and continuum mechanics. The authors develop a continuum model to analyze the spatially varying elastic modulus tensor in the interfacial region and compare it with discrete atomistic results. They find that the effective elastic properties of grain boundaries can differ significantly from those of the bulk, and that the continuum model can capture the behavior of the interfacial region even when its thickness is small.
