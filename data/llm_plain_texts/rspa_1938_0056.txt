tldr: The authors conducted experiments to identify and measure helium formed in beryllium through y-ray interactions. They used a radioactive source and a metallic beryllium sphere to irradiate the material and collect the helium. The helium was then separated from hydrogen using a combustion method and analyzed using an apparatus. The results showed that helium was produced in the beryllium, confirming the formation of helium through y-ray interactions.
