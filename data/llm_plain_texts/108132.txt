tldr: The author investigates the formation of ice at the bottom of rivers and streams, which occurs under specific temperature and weather conditions. The ice, called "ground-gru," is different from surface ice and has economic and practical implications for people crossing rivers on foot or by horse. The author provides detailed observations of the ice's formation, appearance, and behavior, and discusses various explanations and theories related to this phenomenon.
