revised_title: The Essential Nature of Phytophagous Larvae Coloration and Derived Pigments

  - Metachlorophyll
tldr: The author investigates the coloration of phytophagous larvae and discovers that their colors are due to two factors: pigments derived from their food-plants, such as chlorophyll and xanthophyll, and pigments specific to the larvae. The study also introduces the concept of metachlorophyll, a modified form of chlorophyll found in green larvae. This research helps to understand the relationship between larval and plant colors and the role of natural selection in the development of these colors for protection and camouflage.
