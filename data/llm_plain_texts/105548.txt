tldr: The author, Michael Morris, conducted experiments on different extracts of hemlock from various locations. He found that the Coimbra extract contained a higher amount of an essential oily salt and resin, which are the most active parts of the plant. This could explain the successful effects of the Coimbra extract in treating certain disorders. The author suggests using spirit of wine to obtain these active components from other hemlock extracts for medical use.
