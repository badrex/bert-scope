tldr: The authors discuss numerical methods for analyzing singularities in linear elliptic partial differential equations, focusing on finite-difference methods and error analysis. They propose methods to reduce the amount of work required, such as using graded nets and special equations near singular points. Two practical examples are provided, one in Cartesian coordinates and one in cylindrical polar coordinates.
