tldr: The authors present an improved method for calculating the accuracy of atomic coordinates in X-ray structure analysis using Fourier series. They show that finite summation errors are of the same order of magnitude in one, two, and three-dimensional summations. The authors also examine the effects of thermal motion and experimental errors on atomic structures and propose a method to correct for these distortions.
