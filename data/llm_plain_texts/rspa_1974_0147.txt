tldr: The authors present a self-consistent model potential method for atomic interactions, which can be applied to single-center and two-center systems. They derive the model potential wavefunctions and discuss the long-range interactions between atoms. The method provides explicit forms for the energy and dipole moment at large separations, leading to a better understanding of atomic interactions and their implications in molecular systems.
