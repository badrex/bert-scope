tldr: This article discusses isotope shifts in the atomic spectra of medium-heavy elements, focusing on the range between the magic neutron numbers 50 and 82. The authors analyze the shifts in terms of nuclear charge distribution and deformation effects, comparing their findings with data from other types of experiments and concepts of vibrational nuclear deformation and nuclear shell structure.
