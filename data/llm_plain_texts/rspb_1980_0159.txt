tldr: This study examines the speciation and evolution of Partula snails on the island of Moorea. The researchers found that despite potential gene flow between the snail populations, large morphological, ecological, and behavioral differences have evolved. The study uses field exploration, laboratory hybridization, and multivariate analysis to assess the degrees of relatedness among the snail taxa and determine the most probable courses of evolution within the group.
