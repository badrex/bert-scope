tldr: This study presents a method to measure tissue fluid in humans, allowing researchers to understand how it is effused and disposed of. The authors found that tissue fluid levels vary throughout the day, with a noticeable increase after meals. They also discovered that blood pressure, both arterial and capillary, follows a similar rhythmical pattern as the effusion of lymph after eating. This research provides insight into the relationship between tissue fluid, blood pressure, and digestion.
