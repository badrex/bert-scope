tldr: This article discusses the origin of chondrules, millimeter-sized objects found in chondritic meteorites. The author examines the chemical, mineralogical, and isotopic constraints on theories of chondrule formation, comparing nebular and planetary origins. The author concludes that both nebular and planetary theories have their merits, and further research is needed to determine the exact formation process of chondrules.
