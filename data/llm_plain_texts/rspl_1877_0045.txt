tldr: The author investigates the difference of potential produced by the contact of different substances, focusing on metals and liquids. They use a modified insulation system and Sir W. Thomson's quadrant electrometer to study the contact potential between various materials, including copper and water, zinc and water, and other metal and liquid combinations. The experiments reveal that the difference of potential varies between different materials and can have significant implications for understanding the behavior of voltaic elements.
