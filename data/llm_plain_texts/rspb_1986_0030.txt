as the cosine of the angle between the line and the line joining the two centres of projection. This is illustrated in Fig. 1, where the two centres of projection are denoted by O and O', and the visible plane by P. The line joining O and O' is the bisector of the angle between the two rays, and is perpendicular to the plane. The line is the projection of the line joining O and any point on the visible plane. The angle between and the line joining O and O' is the angle of intersection of the two rays with the visible plane. It is clear that if the angle of intersection is acute, then the cosine of the angle is positive, and if it is obtuse, then the cosine is negative. Hence the condition for ambiguity is that the cosine of the angle of intersection of the two rays with the visible plane should have the same sign for all the visible points. This condition is satisfied if and only if the two rays intersect on the same side of the visible plane. In other words, the images are ambiguous if and only if the two centres of projection lie on the same side of the visible plane. The criterion is illustrated in Fig. 2, where the two centres of projection lie on the same side of the visible plane, and the images are ambiguous. Conversely, if the two centres of projection lie on opposite sides of the visible plane, then the images are non-ambiguous, as illustrated in Fig. 3. The criterion is of considerable importance in the interpretation of visual texture, and it is to be hoped that it will find application in the design of algorithms for the reconstruction of three-dimensional scenes from two projections. The criterion is also of interest in the theory of human and computer vision, where it provides a simple explanation of the fact that the perception of depth from texture is often ambiguous when the two eyes are converged towards a surface that is nearer than the fixation point. The criterion is also relevant to the problem of determining the orientation of a plane from two perspective projections. It is shown in Appendix 6 that the orientation of a plane is uniquely determined by two perspective projections if and only if the two centres of projection lie on opposite sides of the visible plane.
