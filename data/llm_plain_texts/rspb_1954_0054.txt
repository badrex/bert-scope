tldr: The authors conducted experiments on mice to study the origin, strength, and duration of actively and adoptively acquired immunity in tissue transplantation. They discovered that adoptive immunity, a third mode of immune state, occurs when a normal subject becomes immune due to the transfer of immunologically activated tissue from an actively immunized donor. Adoptively immunized animals can give a secondary response, making them different from passively and actively immunized animals. This finding has implications for understanding tissue transplantation immunity and the development of immunotherapies.
