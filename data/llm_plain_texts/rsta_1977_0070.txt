revised_title: Lunar Sample Analysis: Radiation and Temperature Histories
semantic_tags:
  - Lunar geology
  - Cosmic ray analysis
  - Thermoluminescence
  - Microcratering
  - Radiation history
tldr: This article discusses the use of charged-particle track analysis, thermoluminescence, and microcratering techniques to study lunar samples and understand the radiation and temperature histories of the Moon. The authors examine the effects of solar and cosmic radiation, thermal characteristics, and cosmic dust impacts on the lunar regolith.
