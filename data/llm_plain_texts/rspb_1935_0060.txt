tldr: Researchers discovered a new sub-lethal colour mutation in house mice, called "grey-lethal." This mutation causes the mice to have a pure grey coat, stunted growth, and delayed eye development. Grey-lethal mice eventually die between the 22nd and 30th day of their lives. The mutation is caused by a single gene and is inherited in a simple recessive manner. The researchers also found that the presence of the mother is essential for the continuation of the grey-lethal mice's life, as they cannot survive without her milk.
