tldr: 'This article explores the differences in mechanisms of intelligence among vertebrates, focusing on the learning abilities of rats and goldfish. The author suggests that rats are more efficient in using the outcome of one trial to predict the outcome of the next, leading to better performance in tasks like reversal learning and alternation learning. The study highlights the importance of considering various experimental paradigms to understand the nature of differences in animal intelligence.'
