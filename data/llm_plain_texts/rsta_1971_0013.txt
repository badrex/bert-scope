tldr: The article discusses the petrology and trace element analysis of igneous and metamorphic rocks from the ocean floor. It examines the K, Rb, Cs, Sr, and Ba contents and Sr isotope ratios of ocean floor basalts, and explores the effects of alteration, differentiation, and mantle source chemistry on these trace elements. The study suggests that mantle chemistry is decoupled from plate movement dynamics and that early depletion of parts of the mantle in dispersed elements may be responsible for the observed trace element variations.
