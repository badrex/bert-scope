tldr: The article discusses the role of apoptosis in development, tissue homeostasis, and malignancy. It explores how various chemotherapeutic agents induce apoptosis in HeLaS3 cells and how apoptosis plays a crucial role in preventing the generation of aneuploidy and recombination events commonly associated with cancer. The study also highlights the importance of understanding the mechanisms of cytotoxicity and the impact of cell cycle stasis on apoptosis.
