tldr: The author, Henry E. Roscoe, developed a method to determine the specific gravity of vapours of high boiling-point compounds, such as thallium and lead chlorides. The method involved vaporizing the substance in a porcelain globe and analyzing the contents after reaching a constant temperature. The specific gravity of thallium chloride vapour was calculated to be 8.49, and that of lead chloride vapour was 9.62.
