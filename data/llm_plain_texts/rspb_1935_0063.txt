tldr: The study investigates the spiracular movements and respiration in the common rat flea, Xenopsylla cheopis. The flea's spiracles regulate gas exchange by opening and closing in response to chemical stimuli and environmental factors such as oxygen and carbon dioxide levels. The research provides insights into the flea's respiratory mechanisms and how they adapt to different conditions.
