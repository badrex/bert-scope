tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the electrical resistivity of lithium, sodium, and potassium at low temperatures and high pressures. They found that the resistivity of these metals changes with temperature and pressure, and that the temperature and volume coefficients of resistivity are related. The results challenge current theoretical predictions and suggest that the volume coefficient of resistivity is closely connected to the high-temperature value of the thermoelectric power.
