tldr: This article discusses the role of mucopolysaccharides in protecting cartilage cells against immune reactions, particularly in the context of rheumatoid arthritis. The authors investigate the effects of reactive complement-sufficient antisera on embryonic and post-foetal cartilage and find that the degradation of the cartilage matrix is due to the enzymatic activity of associated soft connective tissue. The results have implications for understanding the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis.
