tldr: 'Sir Herbert Jackson was a renowned chemist who made significant contributions to the fields of chemistry and phosphorescence. He discovered that high-vacuum tubes could emit X-rays, which he later used to create the first X-ray tube. Jackson also conducted extensive research on detergents, weathering of stones, and chemical reactions. His work in these areas helped improve laundry practices and the preservation of historical buildings.'
