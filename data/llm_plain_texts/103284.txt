tldr: The author, R. Mead, describes three cases of hydrophobia, a condition caused by the bite of a mad dog. The patients experienced severe symptoms, including anxiety, inquietude, and an aversion to liquids. Despite various treatments, including bloodletting and blistering, the patients ultimately died. The author suggests that hydrophobia is caused by a specific type of inflammation in the blood and tension in the nervous membranes, leading to the intense pain and difficulty in swallowing experienced by the patients.
