tldr: The authors measured the hyperfine structure of the ground state of stable europium isotopes using the method of magnetic resonance in an atomic beam. They determined the magnetic dipole interval factor A and the electric quadrupole constant B for both isotopes, providing valuable information for understanding the atomic and nuclear properties of europium.
