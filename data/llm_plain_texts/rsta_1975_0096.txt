tldr: This article discusses early research and theoretical models of ultra-low frequency waves in the magnetosphere. The authors explore the east-west phase variation and the effect of the ionosphere on micropulsations observed at the ground. They also examine the Pointing vector and its relation to energy flow in the magnetosphere, as well as field line resonance and its impact on the oscillations of magnetic fields.
