tldr: The authors studied the cross-sections for magnetic scattering of slow neutrons by metallic electrons using band theory. They analyzed two cases: the free-electron model of a simple metal like sodium and the collective-electron model of a ferromagnet, focusing on iron. The scattering was found to be weak and diffuse, and the collective-electron model's predictions were compared with the spin-wave model, with the spin-wave theory showing better agreement with experimental data.
