tldr: This article discusses the photoelectric measurement of diurnal variations in daylight in temperate and tropical regions. The authors used sodium and selenium cells to measure daylight and found that the sodium cell is less sensitive to sunlight. They also observed that the vertical illumination in the violet from sun and sky varies with solar altitude, and that the values obtained with the sodium cell are lower than those obtained with the selenium cell.
