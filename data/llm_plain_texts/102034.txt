tldr: The author, Dr. Martin Lyster, proposes that the material cause of earthquakes is the same as that of thunder and lightning: the inflammable breath of pyrites. He argues that pyrites, a mineral containing iron and sulfur, is responsible for the release of these gases, which can ignite in the air or underground, causing earthquakes. Lyster also discusses the geological features of mountains and the presence of subterranean cavities, which he believes contribute to the occurrence of earthquakes.
