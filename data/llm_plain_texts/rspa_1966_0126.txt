tldr: The authors present a semi-classical treatment for atomic collisions, which is more accurate than the standard impact parameter treatment. They demonstrate that this approach is applicable when the wavefunction is expanded in terms of the eigenfunctions of the quasi-molecule formed by the colliding systems. The study focuses on symmetrical charge transfer and shows that the semi-classical treatment predicts damping of oscillations in charge transfer close collisions.
