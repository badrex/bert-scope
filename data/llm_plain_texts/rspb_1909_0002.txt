tldr: Researchers discovered a new species of trypanosome in Zanzibar, which causes disease in animals and potentially humans. The trypanosome is small in size, with a poorly developed undulating membrane and no free flagellum. Further studies are needed to understand its impact on public health and to classify it among other trypanosome species.
