tldr: This article reviews the types of nodules erupted in kimberlite, believed to be of upper mantle origin, and discusses their pressure and temperature estimates to understand the conditions of their formation. The author emphasizes garnet-herzolites and their distribution in the upper mantle, and compares the pressure-temperature gradients of nodule suites with geotherms based on geophysical data. The study provides insights into the Earth's upper mantle and mantle processes.
