tldr: This article discusses the various structures and properties of ice, focusing on the hexagonal and cubic forms. The authors analyze the atomic structure, density, and thermal expansion coefficients of ice, and explore the hydrogen bonding and molecular orientations within the ice lattice. They also examine the structure determination methods, including neutron diffraction, and the implications of these findings for understanding ice's behavior and properties.
