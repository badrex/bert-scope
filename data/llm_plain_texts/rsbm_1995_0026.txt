tldr: John Sutton was a renowned geologist who made significant contributions to the understanding of Precambrian rocks, particularly the Lewisian Gneiss of north-west Scotland. His work, conducted with fellow student Janet Watson, established new methods for studying Precambrian complexes and provided insights into the age and formation of these ancient rocks. Sutton's research had a lasting impact on the field of geology and inspired further studies in Precambrian terrains worldwide.
