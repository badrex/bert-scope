tldr: This article presents a detailed analysis of the Stark effect in the molecular spectrum of hydrogen. The author used a stigmatic concave grating spectrograph to obtain a more complete and accurate analysis of the region between 656.3 nm and 121.6 nm, where nearly the entire strength of the triplet bands is concentrated. The study found interesting regularities in the patterns observed, which fall within the restrictions of the theoretical framework. The results provide new information that may be helpful in the analysis of the hydrogen spectrum.
