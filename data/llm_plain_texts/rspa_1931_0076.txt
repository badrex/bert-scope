tldr: The authors investigate the molecular symmetry and properties of hexa-aminobenzene in its crystalline state using X-ray crystallography. They determine that the crystal structure has a simple cubic lattice with a unit cell containing 16 molecules, each with threefold symmetry. The authors also study the substance's stability and decomposition rate in air.
