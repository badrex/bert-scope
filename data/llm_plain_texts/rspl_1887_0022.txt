tldr: The author examines the residual glow of phosphorescent materials, specifically focusing on yttria and its components, using an instrument called a phosphoroscope. They also study the effects of calcium on the phosphorescence of yttria and samaria, discovering that it alters the order of visibility of the constituents of yttrium.
