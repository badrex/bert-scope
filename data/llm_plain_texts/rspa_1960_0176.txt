tldr: The article presents general formulae for generating unsteady potential flows with the presence of finite two-dimensional cavities. It investigates two distinct cases, where the fluid at infinity is either in accelerative motion or at rest, and provides a class of solutions for each case. The study also includes steady flows in a gravitational field and explores solutions representing such flows past a finite cavity.
