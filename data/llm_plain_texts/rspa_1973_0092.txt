tldr: The article presents a study on the large-deflection torsion and flexure of initially curved strips in plate theory. The author derives general expressions for the relations between bending moment, torque, longitudinal curvature, and twisting curvature for strips of lenticular and constant section. The behavior of strips under pure moment and pure torque is examined, considering the effects of initial curvatures and the presence of alternative states of deformation due to bifurcational or snap-through instabilities.
