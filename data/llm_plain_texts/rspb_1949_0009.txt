tldr: This article presents a theoretical treatment of the frequency distribution of chiasmata along a chromosome, based on Darlington's postulate of relating crossing-over to chromosome coiling. The author assumes that each chromatid behaves like an elastic thread subject to torsion and longitudinal stress, which can break at a specific breaking load. The study shows that in the absence of interference, the distribution goes over to the Poisson type, in agreement with Haldane's conclusions. The article also calculates the mean and standard deviation of the distribution, providing insights into the relationship between mean chiasma frequency and chromosome length.
