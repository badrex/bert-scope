revised_title: Perturbation Theory for Projected States in Quantum Mechanics
semantic_tags:
  - Quantum Mechanics
  - Perturbation Theory
  - Projection Operators
  - Symmetry in Physics
  - Variational Method
tldr: The author develops a method for performing perturbation theory on projected states in quantum mechanics, which is useful for systems with symmetry. The method is applied to the problem of the center-of-mass motion of a nucleus, and it can also be used in other branches of quantum theory.
