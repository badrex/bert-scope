tldr: This article investigates the specific heat of metals and its relation to atomic weight. The authors conducted experiments on cobalt, nickel, gold, platinum, copper, and iron, and found that the products of specific heat and atomic weight were not constant, as the law of Dulong and Petit would suggest. The influence of impurities on specific heat is also discussed, showing that small amounts of carbon or other non-metallic elements can significantly increase specific heat.
