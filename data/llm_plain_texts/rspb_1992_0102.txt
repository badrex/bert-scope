tldr: The article describes the properties of mechano-electrical transducer currents in hair cells of the neonatal mouse cochlea. The researchers found that these currents are the largest found so far in any hair cell, with a conductance of up to 9.2 nS. The study also provides evidence for adaptation in hair cells, which is important for their function in the mammalian cochlea.
