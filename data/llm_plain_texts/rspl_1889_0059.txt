tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the chemistry of camphoric acids and discovered a new left-rotating camphoric acid. The new acid has different properties compared to the original dextro-rotating camphoric acid, such as a lower melting point and a different reaction with acetyl chloride. The author suggests that the two acids may be related like maleic and fumaric acids, and explains the isomerism between them using different spatial arrangements of carbon atoms.
