tldr: The authors conducted a systematic study of fourteen diallyl ester monomers to investigate the intramolecular reaction mechanisms in addition polymerization systems. They observed intramolecular reaction in all cases and found two types that could be distinguished and quantitatively estimated. The results support the theory that the tendency of a monomer to cyclize is largely controlled by the distance between polymerizable groups. The study provides insights into the structure and behavior of polyfunctional systems in polymer chemistry.
