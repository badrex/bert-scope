tldr: The authors report the observation of (n-e+V) pairs in neutrino interactions in the Gargamelle heavy liquid bubble chamber. These events may indicate the existence of new particles, possibly involving charm quarks. The authors discuss the characteristics of the observed events and estimate the background to assess the significance of their findings.
