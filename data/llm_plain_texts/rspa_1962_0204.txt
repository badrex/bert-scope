tldr: The authors measured the gyromagnetic ratio of the proton by observing the precessional frequency of water protons in a magnetic field. The result, uncorrected for diamagnetism, is referred to the unit of electric current maintained at the National Physical Laboratory. This method allows for accurate measurement of other atomic constants and magnetic fields.
