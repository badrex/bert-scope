tldr: The article presents a formal Hardware Description Language (HDL) and its use in the verification of the FM9001 microprocessor. The HDL is formalized using the Boyer-Moore logic, and the FM9001 implementation is specified using this HDL. The authors mechanically checked that the HDL-based implementation specification is an admissible circuit and that it implements its user-level specification using the Boyer-Moore theorem-proving system.
