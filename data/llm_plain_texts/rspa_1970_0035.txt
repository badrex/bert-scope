tldr: The authors developed a nanosecond flash photolysis system using a pulsed laser, which improved time resolution by a factor of a thousand compared to conventional flash techniques. They described the applications of this system in observing absorption spectra of excited singlet states, short-lived triplet states, and chemical events in the nanosecond time region. The new system incorporated fluorescence monitoring, which eliminated the need for a troublesome spark system and provided better reproducibility and sensitivity.
