tldr: This article investigates the thermodynamic properties of gas-phase complexes between hydrogen fluoride and different ethers, such as dimethyl ether, methyl ethyl ether, and diethyl ether, using infrared spectroscopy. The equilibrium constants and heat of association of these complexes are determined, revealing that diethyl ether forms the strongest bond with hydrogen fluoride. The far-infrared spectra of these complexes are also recorded, observing a band associated with the intermolecular stretching vibration of the complex.
