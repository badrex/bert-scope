tldr: This article investigates the magnetic fields generated by dynamo action in compressible, non-uniform conducting fluids under axisymmetric conditions. The authors construct comparison functions to bound the meridional flux function and prove that it decays uniformly to zero. They also explore the decay of other field parameters, such as the meridional vector field, external multipole moments, and toroidal current density. The results show that axisymmetric antidynamo theorems have not yet been proven effective in the presence of compressibility, and they provide alternative proofs and strengthenings of known steady antidynamo theorems.
