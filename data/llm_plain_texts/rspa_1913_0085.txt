tldr: The author conducted crystallographic studies on sulphonates in the benzene series, focusing on the relationship between molecular structure and isomorphism. They examined various salts, including dichloro- and dibromobenzenesulphonates, and found that the structures of these salts were closely related, providing evidence for the mutual displacement of metals and halogens in the salts.
