tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the protozoa found in soil and their relationship with bacterial growth. They discovered that certain protozoa, such as amoebae, flagellates, and infusorian ciliates, play a crucial role in limiting bacterial activity in the soil. This finding helps explain the increased soil fertility observed after partial sterilization, as the treatment removes factors that limit bacterial growth.
