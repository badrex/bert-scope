tldr: This article investigates the alleged slipping at the boundary of a liquid in motion. The authors conducted experiments with various tubes and surfaces to determine if there was any slipping effect. They found that the times of flow for different surfaces agreed to within the limits of experimental error, providing evidence against the existence of a slipping coefficient. The authors also discussed the importance of accurate thermometry and the need for a direct determination of the unit of volume.
