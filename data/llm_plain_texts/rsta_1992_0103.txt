tldr: The article presents classical and quantum simulations of the surface properties of aluminum oxide (a-Al2O3). It discusses the relaxation and distortion of the lattice in the surface planes, the effects of lattice relaxation on surface energies and atomic structures, and the dynamics of alumina surfaces. The article also explores impurity segregation in alumina and its impact on surface structures and processes such as catalysis, corrosion, and crystal growth.
