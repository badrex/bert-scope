tldr: This article examines the microstructural evolution of fluid flow paths in semi-lithified sediments from subduction complexes. It discusses the role of deformation processes and their interaction with fluid flow in accretionary wedges. The study highlights the importance of microstructural analysis in understanding fluid flow and the need to characterize deformation mechanism paths and syn-deformational properties associated with these events.
