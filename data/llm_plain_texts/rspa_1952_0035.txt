tldr: The author investigates the propulsion mechanism of microscopic organisms, specifically focusing on the action of waving cylindrical tails. By analyzing the motion of a flexible cylinder in a viscous fluid, the study reveals that the organisms move in a direction that balances the viscous stress acting on them. The findings provide insights into the self-propulsion of these organisms and the role of their flagella in their movement.
