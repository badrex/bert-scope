tldr: The authors present a general theory of resonance for a class of resonators, focusing on airspaces enclosed by rigid walls and communicating with the external environment through passages. They derive a formula for determining the resonant note and discuss various cases, including openings, cylindrical necks, and tubes of revolution. The authors also describe experiments comparing their formula with observations, resulting in a satisfactory agreement.
