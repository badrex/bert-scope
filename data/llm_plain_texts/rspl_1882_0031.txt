tldr: The author, A. Vernon Harcourt, introduces an instrument called the aerorthometer to correct gaseous volume measurements. The instrument allows users to adjust for atmospheric pressure and temperature, making it easier to compare gas volumes under standard conditions. This device is particularly useful in technical measurements of coal gas, where standard conditions are crucial for accurate results.
