tldr: 'The article discusses the history of the Iceberg Theory, which was first proposed in the mid-18th century by Daniel Tilas and later developed by Charles Darwin. The theory aimed to explain the distribution of large rocks, known as erratics, found far from their original location. The author traces the development of the theory, its connection to Charles Darwin, and its impact on the understanding of geological phenomena.'
