tldr: Researchers developed a new method to extract and isolate the coking constituents of coal using benzene under pressure. This technique allowed for the removal of coking properties without using pyridine, which has a depolymerizing effect on coal. The process improved the extraction efficiency and eliminated the need for complex apparatuses used in previous methods.
