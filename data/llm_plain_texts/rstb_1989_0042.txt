tldr: The study investigates the mechanism and neural control of ceratal autotomy in the nudibranch Melibe leonina. The autotomy behavior involves rapid severance of cerata, which may help in escaping crab predators. The autotomy plane's ultrastructure and the neural correlate of the behavior are analyzed, suggesting a role for granule-filled cells in the autotomy mechanism and the involvement of specific ganglion cells in signaling muscle contractions.
