tldr: The author discusses the challenges in distinguishing between certain genera of testaceous mollusks based on their shells alone and highlights anomalies in the habitats of certain species. The text provides examples of shell similarities that house animals from different orders and genera with different habitats, emphasizing the importance of studying both the shells and the animals for accurate classification.
