tldr: The author investigates the forces acting on a cylinder submerged in a uniform stream, focusing on wave resistance and vertical force. They use a method of images to calculate the forces and moment on the cylinder, considering both the hydrodynamic and hydrostatic components. The study provides insights into the behavior of submerged bodies in fluid flow.
