tldr: This article describes experiments conducted on the radiation of helium and mercury in a magnetic field. The authors observed the Zeeman effect, which is the splitting of spectral lines when a substance is placed in a magnetic field. They found that the separation between the components of the spectral lines was proportional to the field intensity. This research helped to understand the relationship between magnetic fields and the behavior of light emitted by atoms.
