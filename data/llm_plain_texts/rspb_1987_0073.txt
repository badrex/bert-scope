tldr: The authors analyzed propolis and bud exudate of Populus x euramericana using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify 104 compounds, including 26 never before found in propolis or bud exudate. They confirmed that bees use bud exudate from Populus for propolis production and found that propolis composition varies depending on its source.
