tldr: James Stark challenges the prevailing cell theory of animal tissue development, arguing that ultimate filaments of muscles and other tissues are formed from the fibrinous portion of the blood rather than cells. He contends that fibrinous corpuscles, which have been considered as cell nuclei, are actually fragments of broken-down tissues and play no role in tissue development. This view is applied to the formation of the skin, blood vessels, and nerves, as well as the theory of secretion.
