tldr: This article investigates the mechanisms behind the organ-specific and light-induced expression of photosynthetic genes in plants. The researchers identified specific DNA sequences that regulate the expression of the rbcS and Cab genes in transgenic plants, providing insights into how light influences plant development and growth.
