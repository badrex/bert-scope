tldr: The authors discuss the main features of particle production in nucleon-nucleon collisions in the energy range of 30 to 106 GeV, focusing on the nature of secondary particles, energy partition, number of secondaries produced, and the distribution of created particles. They analyze experimental data from cosmic rays and accelerators, and investigate the variation of experimental parameters with primary proton energy. The authors find that the proportion of pions and the average degree of elasticity remain constant over a wide energy range, while large fluctuations in multiplicity and anisotropic angular distributions are observed in high-energy collisions.
