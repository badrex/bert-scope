tldr: This study investigates the mechanism and rate of the hydrogen-oxygen reaction between the second and third explosion limits. The authors propose that the chain reaction is initiated by the dissociation of hydrogen molecules. They develop a rate equation that successfully describes the experimental results for the variation of reaction rate with hydrogen and oxygen pressures and with the addition of inert gases. The reaction is found to be autocatalytic, with surfaces playing a significant role in its development over time.
