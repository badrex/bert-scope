tldr: This article presents a series of experiments conducted by Stanesby Alchorne, who aimed to challenge the common belief that tin destroys the ductility of gold when mixed together. Alchorne found that small amounts of tin can be added to gold without causing brittleness, and that the metal's properties remain unaffected. The experiments also showed that the brittleness observed in some cases was likely due to the presence of arsenic in the tin.
