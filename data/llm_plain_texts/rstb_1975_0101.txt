tldr: This study examines the petrography and sedimentology of terrestrial sediments on Aldabra, a raised atoll in the Western Indian Ocean. The research identifies seven textural groups in the sediments, which provide evidence of various depositional environments and help in understanding the history of Aldabra. The findings contribute to the understanding of sea-level fluctuations and changes in depositional environments in the area.
