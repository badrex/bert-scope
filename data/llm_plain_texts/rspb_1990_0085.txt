tldr: This study investigates the role of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF), identified as nitric oxide, in the increased blood flow to the rat stomach mucosa in response to pentagastrin. The researchers found that EDRF/nitric oxide participates in the pentagastrin-induced hyperaemia, while the involvement of prostacyclin was eliminated using the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor indomethacin.
