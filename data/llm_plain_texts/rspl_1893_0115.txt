tldr: This article discusses mycetoma, a chronic inflammation that affects the foot and, less commonly, the hand. The author presents evidence that the black and white particles found in mycetoma are the result of a large, branching, septate fungus and a lowly organized fungus, respectively. The author also notes the similarities between the fungus in mycetoma and that of actinomycosis.
