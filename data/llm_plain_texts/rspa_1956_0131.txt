tldr: The article discusses the absorption of ultra-violet radiation by atmospheric gases, focusing on absorption continua, line absorption, and band absorption. It explores the effects of these absorptions on the solar radiation passing through the atmosphere and provides a summary of absorption data for major atmospheric constituents like N2, O2, N, and O3. The study also highlights the importance of understanding absorption processes in the context of the ionosphere and the overall radiative balance in the atmosphere.
