tldr: The author conducted experiments on nerve-crossing to determine if restoration of voluntary co-ordinated movements could occur with altered innervation. They found that nerve-crossing allowed for the restoration of function, suggesting that nerve-centres can alter their functions and form new paths for nervous impulses, leading to perfectly coordinated movements.
