tldr: The study investigates the role of extracellular anions in the secretion of saliva by the rabbit mandibular gland in vitro. The researchers found that complete replacement of with also enhances secretion, while replacement with or isethionate supports secretion but at diminishing rates. The data suggest that an electroneutral cotransport model or a double countertransport plus model may be the basis of primary salivary secretion. Ductal modification of primary saliva is inhibited by omission, which may be related to an effect on the postulated exchange mechanism in the luminal duct membrane.
