tldr: The authors studied the triplet state formation efficiencies of ten aromatic hydrocarbons in solution using a new method that measures the relative fluorescence intensities and the amounts of triplet-triplet absorption following flash excitation. They found that the ratio of triplet state formation efficiencies varies less than the separate rate constants, which is discussed in terms of possible selection rules for spin-forbidden non-radiative transitions.
