tldr: The author, George Biddell Airy, presents corrections to the computed wave-lengths of light published in the Philosophical Transactions of the year 1868. He used a graphical process to compare and correct the wave-lengths, taking into account the measurements of Angstrom and Ditscheiner. The corrections were made to improve the accuracy of the wave-lengths for various spectral lines, including those of the atmosphere and metals.
