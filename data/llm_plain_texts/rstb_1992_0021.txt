tldr: This article examines the sinking and sedimentation of diatoms during the spring bloom in temperate waters. It explores the various factors contributing to the loss of diatoms, such as sinking rates, aggregation, and grazing. The study highlights the importance of diatom sedimentation in the biological pump, which helps transport organic material from the surface to the seabed.
