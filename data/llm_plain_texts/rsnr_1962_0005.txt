tldr: Sir George Cayley, a Yorkshire Baronet, is considered the true inventor of the modern aeroplane and the originator of the science of aerodynamics applied to aircraft. He proposed the separation of the system of thrust from the system of lift, which was a crucial break from the ornithopter tradition. Cayley made significant contributions to airship design, the caterpillar tractor, and the understanding of bird flight, which helped him develop his ideas on heavier-than-air flying machines.
