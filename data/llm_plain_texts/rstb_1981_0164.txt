tldr: The article describes the arthropod Sidneyia inexpectans, a Middle Cambrian species found in the Burgess Shale. The author studies and reconstructs the animal's body, including its cephalon, thorax, abdomen, and caudal fan. Sidneyia had unique features like stalked eyes, preoral antennae, and a coxa-body attachment that resembles modern merostomes. The author suggests that Sidneyia was a bottom-living, carnivorous animal that ate larger and harder food than trilobites. Although Sidneyia shares some similarities with merostomes, its body plan and absence of chelicera distinguish it from this group.
