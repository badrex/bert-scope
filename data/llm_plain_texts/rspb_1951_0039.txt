tldr: The authors investigated the central nervous control of food and water intake in rats, focusing on the hypothalamus. They found that hypothalamic lesions can cause obesity and diabetes insipidus, and that food and water intake are regulated by different, yet related, aspects of the diet. The study provides evidence for the activity of a hypothalamic satiety center and suggests that calorie content is the main determinant of food and water intake.
