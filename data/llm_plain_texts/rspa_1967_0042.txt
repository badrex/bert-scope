tldr: The authors study the behavior of two initially separated gas streams that unite and form a combustible mixture in Oseen flow. They focus on the Burke-Schumann flame, a model of a diffusion flame, and analyze its properties. The Oseen approximation is used to examine the mixing and burning process, providing a unified treatment of the field.
