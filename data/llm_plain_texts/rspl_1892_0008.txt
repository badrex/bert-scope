tldr: The author conducted experiments on the efferent fibers distribution in the lumbo-sacral plexus of Macacus, discovering two distinct classes of innervation: pre-axial and post-axial. These classes represent different patterns of muscle supply by spinal roots, which vary significantly among individuals. This study provides insights into the complex organization of the nervous system and the coordination of movements in animals.
