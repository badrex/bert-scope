tldr: The authors studied the photochemical reactions of butyric acid, methyl butyrate, and sodium butyrate, as well as the photosensitized decomposition of butyric acid, methyl butyrate, and isobutyric acid. They found that the primary reactions for butyric acid and methyl butyrate are similar to the type I and type II reactions that occur in the photolysis of aldehydes and ketones. The study provides insights into the photochemistry of carboxylic acids and esters, which can help in understanding their primary photochemical reactions.
