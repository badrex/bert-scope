tldr: The author investigates the effects of X-rays and β-rays using the cloud method, which involves capturing the tracks of electrons ejected from atoms by the radiation. This method allows for a direct study of individual quanta and provides valuable information about the point of origin, direction, range, and ionization of the particles. The author also discusses improvements made to the cloud chamber and the techniques used to produce and study the radiation.
