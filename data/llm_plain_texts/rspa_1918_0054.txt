tldr: This article presents further experiments on the spontaneous generation of heat in recently hardened steel, focusing on nickel-chromium steel. The authors discovered that certain heat treatments led to the absorption of heat instead of its evolution, and they established an empirical law to approximate the gradual diminution of heat evolution. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the hardening process and the properties of steel.
