  - Krypton and xenon isolation
tldr: The author estimates the relative amounts of krypton and xenon in atmospheric air by liquefying air and concentrating these gases. They found that liquefaction nearly doubles the content of argon in the air and that krypton and xenon can be concentrated by submitting liquefied air to a second liquefaction. The author also discusses the process of fractionating the gases to isolate krypton and xenon.
