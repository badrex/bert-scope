tldr: This study investigates the sensory and motor innervation of Nereis, a type of polychaete worm. The motor innervation is found to be both polyneuronal and multiterminal, similar to the condition in Arthropods. The sensory equipment of the parapodia includes several prominent neurons that function as rapidly adapting stretch receptors, which may help integrate the activity of individual segments and ensure coordinated flexibility of the worm's movements. The research also examines the sensory cells of the parapodial cirri and their potential roles in chemoreception and mechanoreception.
