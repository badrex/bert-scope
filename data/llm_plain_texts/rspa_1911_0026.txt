tldr: The authors conducted experiments on stream-line motion in curved pipes using colored water to visualize the flow patterns. They observed that stream filaments break up and follow the walls of the pipe, leading to a decrease in flow rate. The study provides insights into the behavior of fluids in curved pipes and has implications for engineering and design.
