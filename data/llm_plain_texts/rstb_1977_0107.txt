tldr: This article discusses the environmental changes and sea level fluctuations during the Late Devensian cold stage in Great Britain and Ireland. The authors analyze various methods to date these changes, including radiocarbon dating and varve chronology. They also examine the evidence of shorelines, cliffs, and platforms to understand the impact of glacial history and the relationship between sea level and time in different localities.
