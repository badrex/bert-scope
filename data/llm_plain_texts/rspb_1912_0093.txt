tldr: The author studied the life-cycle and development of Trypanosoma gambiense, a parasite responsible for African sleeping sickness, in both Glossina (tsetse flies) and monkeys. They discovered that the parasite undergoes different stages in the fly and monkey hosts, with the tsetse fly being the primary vector for transmission to humans. The study provides insights into the parasite's development and potential strategies for controlling the disease.
