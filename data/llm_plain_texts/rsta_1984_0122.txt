tldr: The authors describe a technique for performing all-optical logic operations, such as NOR, NAND, XOR, OR, and AND, on a single etalon. They demonstrate this technique through computer simulations and experiments with dye-filled and GaAs etalons, which verify its validity. This method allows for fast and energy-efficient optical logic operations, with potential applications in optical computing and communication systems.
