semantic_tags:
  - Fluid dynamics
  - Heat transfer
  - Rotating systems
  - Buoyancy
  - Convection
tldr: The article investigates the forced flow caused by heating a rotating liquid. The authors analyze the effects of viscosity, buoyancy, and convection in the liquid and provide mathematical equations to describe the flow patterns. They also discuss the implications of their findings for understanding and improving heat transfer in rotating systems.
