revised_title: Uniform Fields in Heterogeneous Media: Fibrous Systems and Phase Geometry
semantic_tags:
  - Fibrous Media
  - Elastic Strain Fields
  - Material Symmetry
  - Transformation Strains
  - Concentration Factors
tldr: The author investigates uniform strain fields in heterogeneous media, specifically fibrous systems and media of arbitrary phase geometry. They find that uniform strain fields can be created by applying certain uniform overall stresses or strains, and explore the properties of these fields, including connections between phase and overall moduli, concentration factors, and transformation influence functions.
