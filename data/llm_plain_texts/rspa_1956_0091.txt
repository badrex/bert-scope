tldr: The article discusses the unsteady development of incompressible inviscid jet flows with free boundaries. The author presents a technique to analyze the flow and calculates the shape of the jet at various stages of the motion. The study focuses on the initial stages of the motion and the jet's shape after large but finite time.
