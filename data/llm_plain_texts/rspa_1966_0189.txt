tldr: The authors conducted a detailed analytical and kinetic study of the thermal decomposition of monosilane in the temperature range of 375 to 600Â°C and initial pressure range of 36 to 230 mmHg. They found that the gaseous products in the early stages of the reaction were hydrogen, disilane, and trisilane. A solid silicon hydride was also formed later in the reaction, with its composition varying as the reaction progressed. The reaction was accelerated by the addition of certain foreign gases, and a tentative mechanism involving the species silene was proposed.
