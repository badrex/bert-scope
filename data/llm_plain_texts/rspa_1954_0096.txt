tldr: The authors analyzed the paramagnetic resonance spectra of ferric rubidium sulphate and ferric potassium selenate alums to determine the nuclear magnetic moment of the ferric ion. They found that the splitting of the ferric ion's state can be explained by a spin Hamiltonian containing trigonal terms of the second and fourth degree and a cubic term. No resolved hyperfine structure was found, and the overall width of any such structure must be less than 0.1 cm^-1. This study provides insights into the crystal field theory and the properties of ferric alums.
