tldr: The author presents a new approach to particle motion using relativity and wave mechanics. They extend the equations of motion to a 5-dimensional continuum and suggest that these equations may have more than a formal significance. The author also discusses the wave equation for charged and neutral particles, showing how it relates to the propagation of light in empty space.
