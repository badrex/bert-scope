tldr: The article describes the development and segmentation of the post-naupliar germ band in the amphipod Gammarus pulex. It explains how the ectoderm and mesoderm rows form and differentiate, leading to the formation of segments and limbs. The study provides insights into the complex process of embryonic development in this crustacean species.
