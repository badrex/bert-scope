tldr: James Robertson, a King's Surveyor of Land in Jamaica, observed that the variation of the compass had not changed in the island for a considerable period. He compared the original diagrams of land grants from as early as 1660 with recent surveys and found that the courses of the lines and meridians were consistent. This indicates that no significant change in the compass variation had occurred in Jamaica during that time. Robertson also noted that no other surveyor or engineer in Jamaica had accurately measured the latitude, longitude, or compass variation until his own work.
