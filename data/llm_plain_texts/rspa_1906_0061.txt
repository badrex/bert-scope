tldr: The authors investigated the influence of electric fields on spectral lines using an interferometer and an echelon spectroscope. They found that the passage of Rontgen rays did not alter the wavelengths of the mercury lines, and that the luminous particles did not acquire a significant velocity in the direction of the discharge. The experiments showed that any electrical analogue of the Zeeman effect was largely masked by the widening of the lines.
