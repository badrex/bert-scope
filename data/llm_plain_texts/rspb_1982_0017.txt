tldr: The authors studied the kinetics of NADPH dissociation from the isocitrate dehydrogenase enzyme complex. They used a fluorescence stopped-flow technique to monitor the time course of the dissociation and found that the dissociation of the enzyme-NADPH complex is not the rate-limiting step in the oxidative decarboxylation reaction. The results provide insights into the mechanism and kinetics of NADP in isocitrate dehydrogenase.
