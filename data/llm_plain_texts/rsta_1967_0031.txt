tldr: The authors analyzed the frequency variations received from Soviet lunar satellites Luna 9 and Luna 10 to study their orbits and landing phases. They discussed the different modes of operation of the satellites and the data collected from Mark 1 radio telescope at Jodrell Bank. The study helped in understanding the orbital elements, landing phases, and communication techniques of the lunar satellites.
