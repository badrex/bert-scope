tldr: This study investigates the effects of various organic substances on the upper limits of inflammability of hydrogen-carbon monoxide-air mixtures. The research shows that oxygen-using capacity of the added substance is crucial in determining the effect on the limit. The findings suggest that branching chain reactions and radical diffusion play a significant role in governing the limits of the flames studied.
