tldr: Prof. Owen describes the fossil remains of Diprotodon australis, a large extinct marsupial from Australia. He discusses the skull, teeth, and bones of the trunk and limbs, comparing them to existing marsupial forms and other extinct quadrupeds. The paper also explores the conditions of Diprotodon's extinction and its analogies with Megatherium.
