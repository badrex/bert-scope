tldr: This article presents a scheme of approximate solution for the treatment of shock waves in steady, plane flow of a perfect gas. The method is based on the neglect of entropy variations produced by the shocks and is applicable when the shocks are weak. The solution provides an extension of Friedrichs' results for waves to interaction regions and can be used to calculate downstream flow without reference to the particular shock shape.
