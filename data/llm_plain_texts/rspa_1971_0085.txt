revised_title: Coordinate Conditions in Riemannian Spaces for Coordinates Based on a Subspace
semantic_tags:
  - Riemannian geometry
  - Coordinate conditions
  - Geodesics
  - Subspace coordinates
  - Metric tensor
tldr: The authors present coordinate conditions for a Riemannian space based on geodesics drawn orthogonal to a subspace. They derive simple coordinate conditions that express the metric tensor in terms of integrals of the linear part of the covariant Riemann tensor. These results are applicable to the space-time of general relativity.
