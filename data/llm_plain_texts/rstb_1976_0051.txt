tldr: This article reviews the United Kingdom's contributions to the International Biological Programme's Freshwater Productivity section. It discusses the methodology, projects, and findings of the UK's research on the River Thames, Loch Leven, and other freshwater ecosystems. The study aimed to measure the biomass of trophic levels and understand the energy flow within aquatic ecosystems. The research provided valuable insights into the structure and functioning of freshwater communities and contributed to the development of limnology as a field of study.
