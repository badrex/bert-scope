tldr: This article investigates the surface temperature of sliding metals and lubricated surfaces. The authors measure the temperature using a rubbing contact thermocouple and find that the localized surface temperature can exceed 1000°C. The temperature depends on the load, speed, coefficient of friction, and thermal conductivity. The findings have implications for understanding the breakdown of lubricant films and the behavior of materials under friction.
