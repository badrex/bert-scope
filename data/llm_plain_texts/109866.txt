tldr: The author, James Rawlins Johnson, observed the reproductive and developmental processes of the Hirudo vulgaris, a type of leech. He found that they reproduce as hermaphrodites, laying capsules of eggs that hatch in three weeks. The young leeches remain colorless and can swim at the water surface with their bellies upward. Johnson also noted the differences in capsule formation and the process of hatching.
