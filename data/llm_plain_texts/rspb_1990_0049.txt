tldr: The authors studied the local circuitry in the intermediate part of the medial hyperstriatum ventrale (IMHV) of the domestic chick using an in vitro slice preparation. They discovered that the IMHV is involved in neural changes that underlie behavioral plasticity, such as imprinting and passive avoidance learning. The study provides insights into the physiological and pharmacological properties of the locally evoked field response in the IMHV.
