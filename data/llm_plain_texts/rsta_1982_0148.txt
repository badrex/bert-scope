tldr: This article discusses the theoretical and structural aspects of gold cluster chemistry. It explores the bonding in tertiary phosphine cluster compounds of gold and the isolobal nature of the Au fragment. The article also examines the importance of gold-gold interactions and the role of molecular orbital calculations in understanding the structures and stoichiometries of gold cluster compounds. The author highlights the predictive capability of the theoretical approach through the synthesis and structural characterization of gold clusters with different geometries.
