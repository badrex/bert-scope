tldr: The authors present a new approach to quantum hydrodynamics, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of liquid helium. They derive the equations of motion from a variational principle and use a Clebsch transformation to create a Hamiltonian form. This new method allows for the exploration of roton excitations and their interactions, providing a more complete understanding of the properties of liquid helium.
