tldr: This article investigates the capture of neutrons by deuterons and the photodisintegration of tritons. The authors use the resonating-group structure method to calculate cross-sections for radiative capture of neutrons by deuterons, considering both electric and magnetic dipole radiation. They also discuss the exchange character of nuclear forces and their impact on the calculations. The results provide insights into the behavior of neutrons and deuterons in nuclear reactions.
