tldr: This study investigates the formation of nitric oxide in carbonic oxide-oxygen-nitrogen explosions at high pressures. The authors found that the secondary formation of nitric oxide increases with the density of the medium, and the optimum composition for this process is 2CO + 2O2 + 2N2. The research also explores the effect of rapid cooling on the survival of nitric oxide in the explosion products, which could have implications for nitrogen fixation processes.
