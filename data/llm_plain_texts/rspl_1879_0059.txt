tldr: The author investigates the isomerism in normal paraffins, specifically hexanes, and discovers that two hexanes exist that must be considered as normal compounds. This finding challenges the current understanding of isomerism and suggests that petroleum may consist of a mixture of isomeric and homologous paraffins, with normal hydrocarbons predominating.
