tldr: The authors investigated the formation of helium and neon in vacuum tubes and discovered that the presence of a nitride film on the electrodes played a crucial role in the formation of these rare gases. They found that when a hollow aluminum anticathode coated with a nitride film was used, both helium and neon were formed. This discovery provided a new perspective on the atomic disintegration of nitrogen and the occurrence of rare gases in vacuum tubes.
