tldr: This study investigates the complex sounds processing by the auditory system, focusing on basilar membrane responses to two-tone and broadband stimuli. The findings reveal striking CF-specific mechanical nonlinearities, such as two-tone suppression and distortion, supporting the hypothesis that all frequency-specific auditory-nerve nonlinearities originate from counterparts in basilar membrane vibration. The results also suggest that the frequency specificity of mechanical nonlinearities depends on the integrity of outer hair cell function.
