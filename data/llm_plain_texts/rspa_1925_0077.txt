tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effect of gelatin concentration, hydrogen-ion concentration, and salt content on ice crystallization in supercooled gels. They discovered that the velocity of ice crystallization is affected by these factors and that the process occurs at regular rates. The findings could help elucidate some of the problems of gel structure.
