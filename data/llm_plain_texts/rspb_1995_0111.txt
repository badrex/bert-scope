tldr: This study investigates the effects of manipulating litter size on the reproductive costs and offspring survival in free-ranging bank voles. The results show that enlarging litters does not increase the number of weanlings per mother and that the mass of juveniles is significantly lower in enlarged litters compared to the control group. However, the survival of juveniles from weaning aged three months does not depend on their mass at weaning. The study concludes that females nursing enlarged litters produce smaller offspring at weaning with no residual effects on future maternal survival or reproduction.
