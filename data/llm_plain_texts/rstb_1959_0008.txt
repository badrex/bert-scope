tldr: The authors describe a simple method for inducing tolerance of homologous tissues in newborn mice using intravenous injection of spleen, bone marrow, or thymus cells. They also study the phenomenon of runt disease, which occurs when newborn mice are injected with adult homologous lymphoid cells. The authors conclude that runt disease is an immunological reaction of the injected cells against their host's tissues. This research has implications for understanding haemolytic disease and developing treatments involving transplantation of lymphoid cells.
