tldr: This article explores the number of complete subgraphs and circuits in graphs, focusing on graph theory and its applications. The authors prove partial results for conjectures made by Erdos and Grunbaum, and discuss the existence of circuits in graphs. They also provide a reformulation of Grunbaum's conjecture and explore its implications.
