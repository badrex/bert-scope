tldr: This article discusses the concept of the geometric mean and its applications in statistical analysis. The authors propose a method for determining the appropriate measures of central tendency and dispersion in data sets, which can be used to infer the true value of unknown or typical members of a class. They also introduce the idea of quartiles and octiles as measures of data distribution and discuss the use of the error-function and logarithms in statistical calculations.
