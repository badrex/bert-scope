tldr: The author studied the interaction between the nucleus and cytoplasm during oogenesis in the fern Pteridium aquilinum. They used autoradiography to track the synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) throughout oogenesis. The results showed that the mature egg contains twice as much DNA as non-gametic nuclei, suggesting that its chromosomes have entered the prophase condition. This research provides insights into the complex cytochemical system within the egg and the role of the nucleus and cytoplasm during oogenesis in ferns.
