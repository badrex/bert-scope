tldr: Researchers studied the color adaptation of African Migratory Locusts to different background colors. They found that locusts change their color to match their surroundings, with green being the most common color when conditions are moist and food is abundant. The study also showed that locusts can adapt to various backgrounds, including black, white, and striped patterns.
