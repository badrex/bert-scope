tldr: The authors conducted experiments with various gas flames, including nitrous oxide and hydrogen, to study the origin of the cyanogen bands in the spectrum. They found that the bands were not solely due to nitrogen, as previously claimed, and that the presence of carbon was essential for their production. The authors also discovered that rubber gas connections used in the experiments contributed to the appearance of the cyanogen bands.
