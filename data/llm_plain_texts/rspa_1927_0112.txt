revised_title: 'Electric Moment and Structure of the Sulphur Complex'
semantic_tags:
  - Crystallography
  - Electric moment
  - Sulphur complex
  - Infra-red radiation
  - Allotropic forms
tldr: The authors examine the electric moment and structure of the sulphur complex by studying its various allotropic forms and liquid phase. They measure the wavelengths at which maximum absorption of infra-red radiation occurs and compare the results to suggest a structure for the sulphur complex.
