tldr: The authors demonstrate the equivalence of two algorisms for determining complex characteristic frequencies in the non-radial oscillations of a star. They show that the two methods, direct and indirect, yield the same results for the complex frequencies belonging to the quasi-normal modes of oscillations. This study justifies the use of the Breit-Wigner formula in the context of one of the algorisms.
