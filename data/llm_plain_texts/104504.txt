tldr: 'Mr. Benj. Cook observed that pollen from different apple tree blossoms could affect the development of neighboring fruit. He discovered that pollen from one tree could change the appearance and possibly the quality of the fruit on a nearby tree. This phenomenon could be important for fruit growers to consider when sorting and planting their trees to avoid unwanted cross-pollination.'
