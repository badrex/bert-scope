tldr: The author examines the frontispiece of Jonathan Swift's novel, Gulliver's Travels, and suggests that it may be a likeness of Sir Isaac Newton. The author compares the portrait to known images of Newton and discusses the context of the novel's satire, particularly in relation to the Royal Society, where Newton served as President. The hypothesis is supported by the timing of the painting and the inclusion of a quote from Persius, which may be a reference to Newton's dual roles as a scientist and Master of the Mint.
