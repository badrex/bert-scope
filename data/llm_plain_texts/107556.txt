tldr: The author, Everard Home, presents observations on the human urethra's internal structure using a microscope. He describes the urethra as having two parts: an internal membrane and an external muscular covering. The author also discusses the structure of the corpus spongiosum and corpora cavernosa, explaining their functions and differences in structure. These findings help correct previous misconceptions about the anatomy and function of the urethra and related structures.
