tldr: This article discusses the equation of state for gaseous mixtures and how it can be used to determine intermolecular forces between different types of molecules. The authors explain the concept of the second Virial Coefficient and how it can be used to calculate the forces between molecules. They also describe the experimental methods used to study gaseous mixtures and the importance of understanding intermolecular forces in predicting the behavior of these mixtures.
