tldr: The authors studied the phosphorus metabolism in the brain using radioactive phosphorus in mice. They found that the uptake of phosphorus into the nucleoprotein and phospholipid fractions decreased during anesthesia and increased during convulsions. The results suggest that the metabolism of both stable and labile elements in the brain can change with its functional activity.
