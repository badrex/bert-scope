tldr: The author, Patrick Brydone, describes a thunderstorm in Scotland and the tragic incident of a young man and two horses being struck by lightning. The horses' hair was singed, and their bodies showed no signs of struggle or convulsion, suggesting that the lightning's force was instantaneous. The cart's wheels also had marks of fusion, indicating the intense heat from the lightning. The author discusses the strange lack of fire or visible electrical discharge during the event and the restoration of equilibrium between the earth and atmosphere afterward.
