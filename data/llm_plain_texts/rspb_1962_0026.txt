tldr: The author investigates the gradual stabilization and adaptation of enzyme activity in bacteria, specifically focusing on the enzyme /?-galactosidase in Bact. lactis aerogenes. They study the enzyme's behavior during adaptation to growth in lactose, de-adaptation when returned to glucose, and re-adaptation back to lactose. The research provides insights into the complex process of adaptation and enzyme stability in bacteria.
