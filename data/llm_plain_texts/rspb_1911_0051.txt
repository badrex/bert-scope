tldr: The authors conducted experiments on frogs without their circulatory apparatus to study the distribution and action of soluble substances. They discovered that substances like adrenaline, strychnine, and morphine can be distributed throughout the body via a peripheral mechanism, which may play a role in local actions, pathological conditions, and organs with limited circulation. This research provides insights into alternative distribution mechanisms in living organisms.
