tldr: The authors develop a non-Gaussian network theory for rubber in biaxial strain, focusing on its mechanical properties. They use numerical computation to solve equations for principal stresses and provide data for various extension ratios. The theory accounts for an important feature of experimental biaxial-strain data that previous network theories couldn't explain.
