tldr: The author proposes a definition of asymptotic flatness at timelike infinity for isolated systems, discussing the universal structure of such AFT1 space-times and using this structure to define energy and angular momentum for these space-times. The study focuses on a modification of the conformal technique that incorporates the projective structure of timelike geodesics, allowing for a better understanding of the physical space-time and its properties.
