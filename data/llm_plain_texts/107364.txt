tldr: The author, John Knox, conducted experiments with thin plates and lenses to study the phenomena of colors. He discovered new fringes and prismatic rings that were not explained by Newton's theory. These fringes were composed of all the prismatic colors and were divided into two classes. The author also found that by using different apparatus, the fringes could be produced in various shapes and sizes, leading to a beautiful appearance of a hexagonal net-like structure. Additionally, he observed new species of prismatic rings when two sets of primary rings were brought into a similar situation.
