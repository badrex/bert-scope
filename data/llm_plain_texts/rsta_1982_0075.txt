tldr: This article discusses the testing of geomagnetic reversal models using palaeomagnetic data from various sources. The authors analyze the site dependence of transitional field data and explore the possibility of a general site-dependence. They also consider the role of palaeomagnetic excursions in understanding geomagnetic reversal processes. The findings support the hypothesis that the geometry of transitional fields is controlled by axisymmetric components, particularly during the onset of the reversal.
