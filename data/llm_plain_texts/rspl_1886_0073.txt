tldr: This article investigates the lifting power of electromagnets and the magnetization of iron. The authors conducted experiments using iron rods and rings to study the relationship between the magnetizing force and the lifting power. They found that the lifting power increased with the magnetizing force, and the results exceeded previous findings by Joule and Rowland. The authors also observed that the length of the iron rods decreased when the magnetization exceeded a certain point, which they attributed to the increased magnetic attraction between the iron particles.
