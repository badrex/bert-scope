revised_title: 'Crystal Structure and Dielectric Properties of Rochelle Salt'

  - Polarization
tldr: The authors determined the crystal structure of Rochelle salt using X-ray analysis and found that the tartrate molecule lies in three planes. They discovered that the dielectric properties of Rochelle salt can be explained by the polarization of oxygen atoms within the tartrate molecule, which can be transferred between molecules.
