tldr: The authors investigated the electric discharge in monatomic gases like helium and argon, finding that they have a higher resistance than other gases. They discovered that during the discharge, monatomic gases absorb and release gas rapidly, and the nature of this action is now clear. The study shows that the difference between monatomic gases and other gases is one of degree, and they are relatively electrically and chemically inert.
