tldr: Researchers studied the effect of pituitary-stalk section on light-induced estrus in ferrets. They found that ferrets with divided pituitary stalks could still respond to artificial light, suggesting that light-induced estrus is not dependent on the integrity of the pituitary-portal vessels or direct hypothalamic innervation of the pars distalis.
