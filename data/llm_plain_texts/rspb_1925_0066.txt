tldr: This study investigates the effect of light on blood circulation and blood pressure. The researchers found that exposure to light caused a temporary dilation of blood vessels, leading to a drop in blood pressure. They also discovered that the response to light varied among individuals, with some showing an initial vasoconstriction before the dilation. The study suggests that the mechanism behind this response is likely nervous in nature.
