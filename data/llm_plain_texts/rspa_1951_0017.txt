  - Protein denaturation
tldr: The author investigates the equilibrium and dynamics of protein molecules in solution, focusing on structurally simple proteins. They use the method of partition functions to formulate equilibrium constants and derive expressions for velocity constants. The study includes the effects of isomerism, molecular cleavage, and protein denaturation, providing insights into the behavior of proteins in aqueous solutions.
