tldr: The authors improved their apparatus to study the impact of solid and liquid spheres on liquid surfaces. They observed and described the formation of splashes, the influence of velocity, and the role of surface roughness. The authors also explained the radial ribs and arms in splashes and provided insights into the bursting of bubbles and the impact of solid spheres.
