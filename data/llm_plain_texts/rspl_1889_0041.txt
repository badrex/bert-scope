tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the fermentation of mannite and glycerin by a microorganism isolated from sheep dung. They ensured the purity of the organism and its growth conditions to accurately observe the chemical changes induced by the microorganism. The study highlights the importance of using pure cultures in experiments to better understand the reactions caused by specific organisms.
