tldr: This study investigates the composition of chylous urine, which contains fatty matter, and how it changes with rest and food intake. The author, H. Bence Jones, found that albumen, fibrin, and blood-globules are excreted before food consumption, and their excretion is influenced by rest and motion. The study disproves the idea that the disease consists of an accumulation of fat in the blood and suggests that it is due to a change in kidney function.
