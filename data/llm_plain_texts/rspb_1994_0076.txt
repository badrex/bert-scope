tldr: The study investigates the motion of the skin covering the supraorbital lateral line canal in ruffe (Acerina cernua L.) and how it responds to local oscillatory water motion. The researchers found that the radial pressure gradient in the canal is mainly determined by the micromechanics of the cupula and the underlying hair cells. This discovery helps to understand the fish's ability to detect water flow around them.
