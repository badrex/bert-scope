tldr: The author, Dr. Joel Langelot, emphasizes the importance and usefulness of three chemical operations: digestion, fermentation, and trituration. He provides examples of their applications, such as the preparation of the volatile salt of tartar, the separation of impure sulfurs, and the extraction of valuable substances from gold. These operations can help chemists achieve better results and improve their understanding of chemical processes.
