tldr: The study examines the external sensory morphology and ultrastructure of the wings and thorax of the parasitoid wasp, Trichogramma minutum. It describes various sensilla and non-innervated hairs on the thorax and wings, which are mainly mechanosensory. The research also discusses the function of these structures in relation to the flight mechanism and control in small insects. The findings contribute to understanding the sensory control of flight parameters in Trichogramma and other small insects.
