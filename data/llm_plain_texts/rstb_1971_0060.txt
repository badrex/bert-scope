tldr: The authors discuss the presence of chromogranin A in sympathetic nerve granules and its role in synaptic transmission. They find that these granules contain proteins similar to those found in adrenal chromaffin granules, suggesting a possible storage role for chromogranin A in sympathetic nerves. The release of chromogranin A and noradrenaline together during the secretory response supports the idea that these proteins are involved in the process of synaptic transmission.
