tldr: The author, R. Badcock, discovered the Farina Foecundans in the Yew-Tree, a unique pollen-producing mechanism. He observed that the flower has no apices, stamina, or stylus, which is why it sheds a large amount of pollen. This discovery is significant in the study of plant reproduction and plant anatomy.
