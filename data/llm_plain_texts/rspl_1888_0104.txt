tldr: The authors present a new method for investigating electrostatic fields by studying the magnetic action of displacement-currents in a dielectric. They developed a device consisting of an iron annulus surrounded by a copper wire coil embedded in paraffin wax between two glass plates, with tinfoil coatings on the outside surfaces of the plates. The electric displacement passes through the iron annulus, and changes in the displacement set up magnetic forces that induce currents in the copper wire, which are then audible in a telephone receiver. This method provides a new kind of proof plane for exploring varying electrostatic fields and has potential for other useful applications, such as investigating specific inductive capacities.
