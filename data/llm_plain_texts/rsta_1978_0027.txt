tldr: This article discusses the high-pressure and temperature conditions in Archaean geotherms, implying magma genesis through crustal anatexis. It also examines the consequences for garnet-pyroxene thermometry and barometry in the context of the Scourie gneiss complex in Scotland. The study provides evidence for very high temperatures and pressures, which led to substantial partial melting of water-bearing supracrustal series and the formation of granitic magmas.
