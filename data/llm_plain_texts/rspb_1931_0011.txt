tldr: The study investigates the metabolic changes in Xenopus laevis, focusing on the calcium and magnesium content of the serum. It examines the effects of pituitary removal and the relationship between the pituitary gland, calcium, and magnesium metabolism. The results show that hypophysectomized animals have a lower calcium content than normal ones, while the magnesium content remains similar. The study suggests that the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland plays a significant role in these metabolic changes and is associated with the activity of the ovaries.
