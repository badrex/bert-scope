tldr: This study examines desiccation cracks in the temperate intertidal zone, focusing on the Severn Estuary, The Wash, and the East Coast of England. The research classifies these cracks based on their degree of desiccation, overall shape, crack margins, angle at which cracks join, and preferred orientation. The environmental controls, such as lithology, stratification, and drying history, are analyzed to understand the formation and preservation of these cracks. The findings reveal that desiccation cracks are distinct from other marginal and continental environments.
