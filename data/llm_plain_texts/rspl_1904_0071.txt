revised_title: 'Milk Sugar Hydrolysis: Comparing Enzyme and Acid Action'
semantic_tags:
  - Enzyme action
  - Acid hydrolysis
  - Milk sugar
  - Sucroclastic action
  - Chemical kinetics
tldr: This study compares the hydrolysis of milk sugar by acids and enzymes, finding that acids increase the rate of hydrolysis and that milk sugar's behavior differs from other sugars like cane sugar and maltose. The research also highlights the influence of concentration, temperature, and products of change on the hydrolysis process.
