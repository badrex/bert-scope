tldr: The authors used a computer simulation system to calculate the electron microscope image contrast of small dislocation loops and stacking-fault tetrahedra in ion-irradiated foils. They studied the contrast of Frank loops in copper and stacking-fault tetrahedra in a Cu 10 at.% Al alloy under various diffraction conditions. The results provide useful information for identifying the nature and geometry of defects in materials.
