tldr: The authors discovered a new yellow pigment called citrinin produced by Penicillium citrinum when grown on glucose media. They described its production process, chemical properties, and its unique reaction with ferric chloride. Citrinin is a characteristic pigment of P. citrinum and is insoluble in water but dissolves in alkaline solutions.
