tldr: This article presents a general theory of mass transport in water waves, taking into account the viscosity of the fluid. The authors develop a theory that considers two types of boundaries: when velocities are prescribed at the boundary and when stresses are prescribed. They apply this method to progressive and standing waves in water of uniform depth, finding results that differ significantly from the perfect-fluid solutions with irrotational motion.
