tldr: This article discusses the role of GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) in regulating the activity of ras p21 proteins, which play a crucial role in cell growth and behavior. Two types of mammalian GAPs, pi 20-GAP and NF1-GAP, are described, and their interactions with tyrosine phosphoproteins and ras p21 mutants are analyzed. The article presents a model for the dual effector and regulatory roles of GAPs in ras function and their significance in biological systems.
