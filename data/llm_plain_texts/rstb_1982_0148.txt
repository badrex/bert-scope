tldr: This article investigates the binding and transport of anions in living tissues, specifically focusing on human lymphocytes. The study finds that an increase in anion permeability is essential for volume regulation during hypotonic swelling. The research also suggests that anions and cations are transported independently during volume regulation, and that anion conductance is limiting in lymphocytes. The findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of volume control in cells.
