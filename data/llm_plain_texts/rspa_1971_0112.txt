tldr: 'The authors studied the flash photolysis of chlorine monoxide and the CIO free radical, measuring rate constants for various reactions involving halogen oxides. They found that the quantum yield for the photolysis and decomposition of chlorine monoxide can be explained by the reactions they observed. The study also demonstrated the production of vibrationally excited oxygen in the reaction between the CIO free radical and oxygen.'
