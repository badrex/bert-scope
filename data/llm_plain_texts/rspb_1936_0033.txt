revised_title: 'The Kidney's Response to Alkalosis During Salt Deficiency'
semantic_tags:
  - Kidney function
  - Alkalosis
  - Salt deficiency
  - Sodium metabolism
  - Potassium excretion
tldr: The authors conducted experiments on healthy individuals to study the effect of alkalosis on the kidneys during salt deficiency. They found that overbreathing, which induces alkalosis, caused the urine to become alkaline. The kidneys' response to alkalosis during salt deficiency involved an increase in the excretion of sodium, potassium, and chloride. The study also showed that the urea clearance and rate of excretion of creatinine, calcium, and magnesium remained unchanged. The increased excretion of base, particularly potassium, helped to alter the urine's pH, resulting in an alkaline urine.
