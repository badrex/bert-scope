tldr: This article extends the general theory of elastic stability to include the imperfection-sensitivity of twofold compound branching points with symmetry of the potential function in one of the critical modes (semi-symmetric points of bifurcation). The author introduces a subclassification into monoclinal, anticlinal, and homeoclinal semi-symmetric branching and relates this bifurcation theory to Rene Thom's catastrophe theory. The paper presents an imperfection-sensitivity perturbation analysis for semi-symmetric branching, providing a complete description of the imperfection-sensitivity surface in the dimensional space.
