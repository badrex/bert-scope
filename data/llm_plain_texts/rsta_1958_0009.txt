tldr: The author studied the de Haas-van Alphen effect in lead at high magnetic fields to determine the shape and properties of the Fermi surface. They found that the Fermi surface consists of several pieces, including a sphere with holes in the second zone, a multiply connected surface with electrons in the third zone, and six "cushion-shaped" surfaces with electrons in the fourth zone. This information helps to understand the electronic properties and behavior of lead.
