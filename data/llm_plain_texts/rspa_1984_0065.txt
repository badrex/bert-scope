tldr: The authors investigate electron Compton scattering from solids, a technique for determining Compton profiles, and explore the effects of multiple scattering and radiation damage on the accuracy and resolution of the experiments. They examine the dependence of experimental Compton profiles on incident energy, scattering angle, and sample thickness to determine the optimal conditions for these measurements. The study also considers energy-dependent corrections and suggests possible improvements to the experimental method.
