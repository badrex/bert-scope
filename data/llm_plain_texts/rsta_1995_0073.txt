tldr: This article examines how ice masses in the High Arctic have been affected by climatic fluctuations in the recent past and how they may respond to possible future shifts in the Earth's environmental system. The authors analyze meteorological data and ice cores to understand recent climate change in the High Arctic, including fluctuations in Arctic ice mass extent, and discuss the links between High Arctic ice masses and climate in the context of global sea-level rise.
