tldr: The authors demonstrate a method to overcome the hole-in-the-detector problem in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging, allowing for the formation of incoherent images of phase objects using coherently scattered electrons. By using a high-angle detector and a suitable inner detector angle, interference effects between atoms in a plane perpendicular to the optical axis can be suppressed, enabling atomic resolution incoherent imaging.
