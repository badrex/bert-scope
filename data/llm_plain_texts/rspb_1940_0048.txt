tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the growth of nodule bacteria in legume roots with effective and ineffective nodules. They found that juice from roots with effective nodules promoted better growth of the bacteria than juice from roots with ineffective nodules. This suggests that ineffective strains of nodule bacteria struggle to grow in the host plant environment, which may explain their ineffectiveness in nitrogen fixation within the host legume.
