  - Experimental Physics
tldr: The author discusses the effect of diminished fluid pressure in rapidly moving portions of a fluid, leading to a slight expansion due to the fluid not being perfectly incompressible. The author also highlights the importance of experimental illustrations in the field of hydro-kinetics, which helps to improve the understanding of those who study it mathematically.
