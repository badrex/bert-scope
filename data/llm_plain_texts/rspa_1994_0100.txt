tldr: This article explores the pressure-induced enhancement of superconductivity in HgBaCaCuO materials. The author discusses two exciton models to explain the superconductivity transition above 150 K at ultra-high pressure. The study suggests that high pressure may enhance the process of charge transfer excitations, leading to a higher concentration of localized positive mediators that can act as strong coupling agents for electron pairing.
