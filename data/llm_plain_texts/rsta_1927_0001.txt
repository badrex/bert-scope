tldr: The authors investigated the behavior of single crystals of aluminum under static and repeated stresses. They found that slip bands in the crystals corresponded closely to octahedral planes, and that the crystals' resistance to further slip increased up to a certain point. The study aimed to understand the causes of fracture under repeated stresses of low magnitude and to verify the assumption that slip bands represent traces of actual "slip planes" on the surface of the specimen.
