tldr: This article presents two different simulations of the Southern Oscillation and El Niño using coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation models. Both models show interannual fluctuations that resemble the Southern Oscillation, but they differ in the way El Niño episodes evolve and the mechanisms that cause a turnabout from El Niño to La Niña and vice versa. The models capture certain aspects of the interactions between the ocean and atmosphere that cause the Southern Oscillation, but reality is more complex, and additional processes not yet included may also have a significant influence on the observed Southern Oscillation.
