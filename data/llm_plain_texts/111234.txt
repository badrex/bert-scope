tldr: The author examines the properties of light through various experiments, focusing on the flexibility and refrangibility of different rays. They discover that the flexibility of light is independent of its refrangibility and that the different flexibility of rays can account for the different colors in fringes made by white light. The author also discusses the relationship between the phenomena of flexion and interference and challenges some existing theories, such as Fresnel's hypothesis.
