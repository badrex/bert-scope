tldr: The author conducted a series of experiments to study the reproduction and development of the common leech (Hirudo vulgaris). They discovered that the leeches are oviparous, with eggs enclosed in a capsule. The development process takes about three weeks, and the young leeches eventually make their way out of the capsule. The author also observed the leeches' mating behavior, which involves copulation similar to that of the common snail.
