tldr: This article investigates the gravitational force inside a long hollow cylinder, considering both Newtonian and non-Newtonian potentials. The author calculates the force on a unit mass at a point in the cylinder's basal plane and discusses the implications for experiments testing the inverse square law of gravitation. The results show that the non-Newtonian force inside a finite hollow cylinder depends on both the radial and vertical positions and increases as the cube of the distance.
