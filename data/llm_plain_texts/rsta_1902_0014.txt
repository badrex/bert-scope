tldr: This article presents experiments conducted using the continuous-flow method of calorimetry to determine the capacity for heat of water between freezing and boiling points. The authors aimed to find the mechanical equivalent of heat in terms of international electrical units. They discovered a method that reduced errors in older methods and provided accurate results, verifying previous work on the specific heat of water.
