tldr: The author, J. Norman Lockyer, discusses the chromospheric lines observed in the sun and proposes that they are due to the not yet isolated bases of the so-called elements. This theory explains solar phenomena such as vertical currents, sunspots, and the corona's structure. If accepted, this idea would also apply to the electric arc spectra of two different metals.
