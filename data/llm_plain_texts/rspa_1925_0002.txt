tldr: The author investigates the phenomenon of total internal reflection and demonstrates that it can be explained as a combination of diffraction and refraction. By analyzing the flow of energy in the vicinity of the critical angle, the author resolves the apparent paradox of energy transmission and provides a deeper understanding of light behavior at the interface between two media.
