tldr: This study investigates the nervous and pharmacological control of tracheal mucin secretion in geese, focusing on the mucin produced by goblet cells. The researchers collected, fractionated, and chemically analyzed the mucins, and used histochemistry and electron microscopy to examine the tracheal epithelium. The results show that acetylcholine increases tracheal mucin secretion, while a- and /?-stimulant sympathomimetic amines do not affect it. The study provides insights into the composition and control of tracheal mucus from goblet cells alone.
