  - Wave velocity
tldr: The authors used a cylindrical cavity resonator to measure the velocity of electromagnetic waves. They determined the resonant frequencies of the resonator and calculated the wave velocity using the internal dimensions and the free-space velocity. This method provided a more accurate and precise measurement of the wave velocity, reducing the uncertainty in this important constant.
