tldr: The authors studied the structure of Sigillaria scutellata and other Eusigillarian stems, comparing them with other palaeozoic lycopods. They examined specimens from the Lower Coal Measures of Lancashire and Yorkshire, focusing on the Rhytidolepis sub-group. The research provides insights into the classification and external morphology of Sigillarian stems, contributing to the understanding of ancient plant life.
