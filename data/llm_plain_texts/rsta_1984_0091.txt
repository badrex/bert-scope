tldr: This article explores the distribution and evolution of asteroid rotation rates, analyzing the data on more than 500 asteroids. The authors find a V-shaped distribution of rotation frequencies, with some evidence that C-type asteroids rotate faster than S-type and M-type asteroids. They discuss various factors affecting asteroid rotation, such as diameter, type, and family membership, and propose an angular momentum drain mechanism that may explain the distribution.
