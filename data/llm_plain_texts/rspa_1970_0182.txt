tldr: This article explores the stability limits and consolute states in quasi-ternary polymer solutions, which contain two different polydisperse polymers. The authors develop equations to describe the behavior of these complex mixtures and provide examples using a system of diphenylether, polyethylene, and polypropylene. The study helps to understand polymer compatibility and the interactions between different polymers in various mixtures.
