tldr: The author examines the fossil floras of the Wyre Forest coalfield and its surrounding areas, focusing on the productive measures and their geological relationships. They divide the coalfield into four regions: Highley, Dowles Valley, Shatterford, and Mamble, and discuss the geology and fossil plant collections from each area. This study provides insights into the coalfield's structure and its relationship to the Midland and Pennine coalfields.
