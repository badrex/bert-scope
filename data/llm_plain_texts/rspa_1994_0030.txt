tldr: The authors study a parabolic double obstacle problem, a version of the Allen-Cahn equation with a double well potential. They analyze the asymptotic behavior of the solution as a small constant approaches zero. Under certain conditions, the solution takes values of 1 in a region and -1 in another region, with a thin interfacial region between them. The authors also study the one-dimensional case and show that the -limit set consists of a singleton.
