tldr: The author observed the effects of a storm on sea water and glass windows using a microscope. He discovered that the storm had spread sea water particles containing salt over the windows and the surrounding area. The salt particles were so small that they almost escaped the sight through a microscope. The author concluded that washing the windows with a great deal of water could restore their former lustre, and that a little salt spread over the Earth could render it more fruitful.
