tldr: This article examines the role of coal-dust in colliery explosions, using the examples of Risca, Seaham, and Penygraig explosions. The author argues that coal-dust, not just firedamp, plays a significant role in the spread and intensity of explosions in coal mines. The author also emphasizes the importance of proper ventilation and mine safety measures to prevent such disasters.
