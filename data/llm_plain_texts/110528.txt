tldr: The article discusses a plan proposed by Baron von Humboldt for observing terrestrial magnetism. He suggests establishing permanent magnetic stations across the globe to make simultaneous observations at fixed intervals, aiming to establish a solid foundation for a future theory of terrestrial magnetism. The plan was supported by the Royal Society, and it led to the establishment of numerous magnetic observatories worldwide.
