tldr: The authors studied the solid-state polymerization of acrylic and methacrylic acids using ultra-violet radiation. They discovered that the polymerization reaction is affected by mechanical stress and temperature. The reaction proceeds in association with crystal dislocations, and the effect of mechanical stress is thought to arise from the displacement of dislocations. This research provides insights into the mechanism of solid-state reactions and the formation of crystalline polymers.
