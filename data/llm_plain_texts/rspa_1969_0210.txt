tldr: The authors used the flame fluorescence method to determine the cross-sections for the collisional de-excitation of lead atoms from the first resonance level by various species. They found the cross-sections for hydrogen, oxygen, water, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, argon, and helium, and discussed the interpretation of these overall quenching cross-sections in terms of possible quenching processes. Additionally, they described a non-equilibrium effect on the intensity distribution due to chemi-excitation of lead atoms in the flames.
