revised_title: Erratum: Mixing, Entrainment, and Fractal Dimensions of Surfaces in Turbulent Flows
semantic_tags:
  - Fluid Dynamics
  - Turbulence
  - Fractal Dimensions
  - Mixing Layers
  - Countercurrent Mixing
tldr: This article is an erratum for a previous paper on mixing, entrainment, and fractal dimensions of surfaces in turbulent flows. The missing page 108 should have contained references to Ramshankar's work on countercurrent mixing layers.
