tldr: The author introduces a new geometry of space, focusing on linear complexes, congruencies, and configurations. They develop a new analytical method using five coordinates and demonstrate how to construct and analyze these geometric structures. This new approach allows for a more symmetrical and comprehensive understanding of space and its properties.
