tldr: This article explores the twistor description of massive fields using cohomological methods. The authors demonstrate how the Penrose transform can be used to describe solutions of the Dirac equations on Minkowski space in terms of cohomology classes on a related five-dimensional complex manifold. This approach provides a cohomological version of integral formulae involving functions of two twistors, offering a better understanding of massive fields in the context of twistor theory.
