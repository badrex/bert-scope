tldr: This study investigates the sensitization of nitrocompounds, such as nitromethane, trinitrotoluene, trinitrobenzene, picric acid, and tetryl, by the addition of small amounts of amines. The researchers confirm sensitization using dropweight impact experiments and develop a new method using differential scanning calorimetry to measure the effect. They find that the nitrocompound-amine mixtures decompose at lower temperatures than the pure components and require a lower impact energy to initiate ignition. The study explains the sensitization by the formation of charge transfer complexes between amines and nitrocompounds, which weaken the nitrocompound C-N bond involved.
