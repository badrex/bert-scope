tldr: The study examines the ultrastructural changes in unmyelinated sympathetic axons proximal to a constriction using electron microscopy. The research finds that immediately after constriction, there are changes in the axons' morphology and organelle content due to mechanical trauma. As time passes, organelles accumulate in the axons, leading to swelling. The breakdown of plasma membranes and Schwann cells' basement membrane allows organelles to escape into the interstitial spaces. The study suggests that axonal swelling is due to the accumulation of axoplasm and organelles, which may be caused by obstructing the normal flow of axoplasm from the cell body to the periphery or an active reaction to axonal injury.
