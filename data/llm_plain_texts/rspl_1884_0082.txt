tldr: The author examines the phenomenon of crystalline reflection in chlorate of potash crystals and discovers a unique spectrum of colors produced by the interaction of light with the crystals. The colors are not due to absorption and are seen in both polarized and unpolarized light. The study provides insights into the optical properties of crystals and the behavior of light during reflection.
