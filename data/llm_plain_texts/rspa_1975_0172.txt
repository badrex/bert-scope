tldr: The author examines the asymptotic behavior of solutions of the fourth-order differential equation for large values of the parameter. They provide exact solutions in terms of generalized hypergeometric functions and discuss the asymptotic forms of the solutions around transition points. The study has applications in plasma physics, hydrodynamics, and vibration analysis.
