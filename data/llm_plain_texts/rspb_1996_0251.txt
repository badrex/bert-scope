tldr: 'This study examines the effects of increased incubation costs on the subsequent brood rearing capacity in common terns. Researchers found that incubating a clutch of three eggs, instead of two, reduced the parents' ability to provision their brood of two. This demonstrates a trade-off between reproductive phases and shows that increased incubation costs can significantly impact parental performance, especially in lower quality pairs.'
