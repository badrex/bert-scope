tldr: 'This study examines the spermatozoa of 19 species of patellid limpets from various locations, including six from southern Africa, nine from the North Atlantic and Mediterranean, and three from Australia and Japan. The results reveal three main centres of radiation for patellid limpets and provide insights into their relationships and taxonomy. The spermatozoa of all species are of the primitive ect-aquasperm type, with variations in head morphology. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the systematics and phylogeny of prosobranch limpets.'
