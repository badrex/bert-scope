tldr: Dr. Andrew Cantwell describes a unique case of a nun suffering from a periodic palsy of the eye-lids. The condition caused her to be blind every evening and recover her vision the next morning. After trying various remedies, the nun was treated with water therapy, which resulted in her complete recovery. This case study highlights the importance of observing and experimenting with different treatments for eye disorders.
