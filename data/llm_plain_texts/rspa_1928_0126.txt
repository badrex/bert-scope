tldr: The authors develop a kinetic method in the new statistics, applicable to the electron theory of conductivity. They discuss the differences between the Einstein-Bose and Fermi-Dirac statistics and apply the method to the gas theory. The study focuses on the electron gas inside metals and the interactions between electrons and metal ions, which affect the conductivity.
