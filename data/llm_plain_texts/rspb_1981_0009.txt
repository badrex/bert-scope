revised_title: 'Camel Desaturation Mechanism and its Impact on Water Conservation'
semantic_tags:
  - Camel physiology
  - Water conservation
  - Dehydration
  - Respiratory system
  - Hygroscopic properties
tldr: 'Camels can reduce water loss due to evaporation from their respiratory tract in two ways: by decreasing the temperature of exhaled air and by removing water vapor from the air, resulting in exhalation at less than 100% relative humidity. This mechanism helps camels conserve water during dehydration and is achieved through cooling and desaturation of the exhaled air.'
