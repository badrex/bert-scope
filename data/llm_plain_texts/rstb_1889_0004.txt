tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the electromotive changes in the mammalian heart, particularly the human heart, and found that the normal variation in the heart's electrical activity is diphasic, with the initial phase at the apex and the terminal phase at the base. They also discovered that a monophasic variation can be a consequence of injury, and that the contraction of the mammalian heart normally begins at the apex.
