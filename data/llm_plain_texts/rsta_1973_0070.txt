tldr: The authors demonstrate the existence of a general horizontal compressive stress field in the Earth's crust using global measurements of absolute stress. They find that the sum of horizontal principal stresses increases linearly with depth, and the maximum shearing stress that the bedrock can withstand is a material property and does not increase with depth. The results have implications for understanding the state of dynamic stress-equilibrium and instability in the Earth's crust, as well as potential applications in seismological research and earthquake prediction.
