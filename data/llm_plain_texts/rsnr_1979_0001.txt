tldr: This article explores the possibility that Sir Isaac Newton's physical and mental health issues, including insomnia, poor digestion, and erratic behavior, were caused by mercury poisoning from his alchemical experiments. The author discusses the connection between Newton's alchemical work, his exposure to mercury vapors, and the symptoms of erethism, a form of mercury poisoning. The article suggests that further research is needed to establish a clear link between Newton's health problems and mercury exposure.
