tldr: The authors investigated the microscopic structure and particle size of semipermeable membranes, specifically precipitation membranes. They discovered that these membranes are made of small particles of slightly different sizes, aggregated together and approaching a spherical shape. The average size of these particles is between 0.1 and 1.0 micrometers. The authors also found that these membranes may consist of flocculated ultramicroscopic particles, which are smaller than the visible particles.
