tldr: 'This study investigates the heat production and oxidation processes of echinoderm eggs during fertilization and early development. The author measures the heat liberation and oxygen consumption of sea-urchin eggs and finds that the heat production closely follows the oxygen consumption, while showing no direct relationship to the rate of morphological organization within the egg. The results suggest that an abundant oxygen supply is crucial for the fertilized and developing egg-cell.'
