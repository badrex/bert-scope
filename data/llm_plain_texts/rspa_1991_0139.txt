tldr: The authors analyze the question of whether a quantum system with no long-range interaction, uniformly accelerated through the Minkowski vacuum, radiates due to excitation by the Unruh-Davies heat bath. They find that, contrary to the prevalent view, when considering all quantum correlations present in the experiment, no radiation will be detected. The study resolves the controversy surrounding the behavior of uniformly accelerating systems.
