tldr: The authors discuss the discovery and structure of a new chlorophyll called bacteriochlorophyll found in brown-colored strains of chlorobacteria. They describe its extraction, absorption spectra, and chemical properties, and provide evidence for its structure and stereochemistry. This discovery expands our understanding of photosynthesis in phototrophic bacteria.
