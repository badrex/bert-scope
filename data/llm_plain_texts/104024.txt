tldr: The author, John Belchier, observed that the bones of several pigs changed to a deep red color solely due to their diet, which consisted of bran that had absorbed red dye from printed calico cloth. The coloration was found to be more prominent in the solid parts of the bones and was resistant to various cleaning methods. Further experiments were planned to determine the source of the color.
