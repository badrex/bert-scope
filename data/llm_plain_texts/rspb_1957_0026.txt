tldr: Researchers Edwards and Waddington explored the process of gynogenesis in mice by irradiating sperm with ultraviolet light. They observed abnormal sperm penetration and activation of eggs, leading to the induction of gynogenesis. This study provided insights into the role of sperm and egg interactions in reproduction.
