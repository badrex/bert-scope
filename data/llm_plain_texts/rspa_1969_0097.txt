tldr: The authors present a method to study ion-implanted crystalline materials by investigating the orientation dependence of charged particle reaction yields in single crystals. This method allows simultaneous examination of implanted atom sites and substrate damage caused by implantation. The authors demonstrate the technique's utility in investigating Fe and Si crystals, revealing differences in implanted ion amounts and distribution, providing a direct explanation for the difference between implanted metallic and non-metallic Mossbauer samples.
