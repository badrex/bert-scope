tldr: This article discusses the development of InSb devices, specifically transphasors with high gain, bistable switches, and sequential logic gates. The authors describe their experiments with InSb etalons and CO lasers, which exhibit continuous wave optical bistability. They also demonstrate the potential applications of these devices in signal amplification, modulation, and the construction of logic gates. Additionally, the authors present a simple all-optical circuit using two devices on a single etalon.
