tldr: The authors synthesize insights from pattern-oriented and process-oriented studies to investigate the factors causing microtine population cycles. They propose that a combination of trophic interactions, specifically specialist predation, and some level of self-regulation is necessary to explain the microtine density cycle. This synthesis challenges the dichotomy between population-intrinsic and community-level positions and suggests that both factors are essential for generating population dynamics.
