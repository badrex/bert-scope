tldr: The author, Henry Hennell, studied the reaction between sulfuric acid and alcohol, leading to the formation of ether. He discovered that the key intermediate in this process is the sulphovinic acid, which plays a crucial role in the formation of ether. Hennell also demonstrated that ether can be obtained from olefiant gas by using similar reactions.
