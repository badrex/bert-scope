tldr: The authors studied the fauna of the Derfel limestone in the Arenig District of North Wales, discovering a rich collection of brachiopods, trilobites, bryozoans, and crinoids. The fauna is a mix of native species and those from foreign origins, mainly from the east Baltic and possibly Russia. This study contributes to understanding the age and affinities of the Derfel Limestone and its significance in the Ordovician period.
