tldr: The author examines the inaccuracies found in the measurement of three degrees of the meridian conducted in England by Lieut.-Col. William Mudge. By using a different method, Don Joseph Rodriguez infers that the astronomical observations at Arbury Hill must be erroneous, despite the quality of instruments and the observer's skill and care. Rodriguez also applies his method to other measurements, such as those in Lapland, Bengal, and France, and discusses the possible causes of discrepancies in the results.
