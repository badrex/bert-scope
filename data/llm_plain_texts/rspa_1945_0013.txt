tldr: The authors discuss the electrical conductivity of an ionized gas in a magnetic field, with applications to the solar atmosphere and the ionosphere. They use the methods of Chapman and Enskog to analyze conduction and diffusion currents in an ionized gas with multiple constituents in a transverse magnetic field. The study provides numerical values for conductivity in the sun's outer layers and the earth's upper atmosphere, and examines the forces due to currents induced in moving material in the sun and the earth's atmosphere.
