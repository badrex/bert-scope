revised_title: 'A New Approach to Classifying Replicators and Modeling Biological Organization'

tldr: The author proposes a classification of replicators and suggests improvements to the A-calculus model of biological organization. They argue for the importance of incorporating better coding of chemical reactions, a reinterpretation of evolutionary behavior, a better appreciation of morphological and genetic factors, and a more complete embedding of the theory into relevant earlier contributions. The author also criticizes the role of natural selection in the dynamics of self-maintaining organizations and suggests a new approach to modeling the 'arrival of the fittest'.
