tldr: This article presents a comprehensive review of over 50,000 observations of the variation of the magnetic needle from 1700 to 1756. The authors collected data from various sources, including the Royal Navy, the East India Company, and the Hudson's Bay Company. They found that the variation of the magnetic needle is influenced by various and different magnetic attractions, possibly due to the Earth's heterogeneous composition. The authors recommend periodic reviews of the variation to improve navigation and understanding of the Earth's magnetic field.
