tldr: The authors studied various acid and alkaline fluid combinations in voltaic cells, observing the evolution of oxygen and hydrogen gases. They found that the mutual neutralisation of acid and alkaline fluids led to continuous currents of considerable power. This research contributed to the understanding of electrochemical cells and their potential applications.
