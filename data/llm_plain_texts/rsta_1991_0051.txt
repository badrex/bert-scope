revised_title: 'Hydrous Fluxing in Subduction Zones: A Physical Model for Melt Production'
semantic_tags:
  - Subduction zones

tldr: This article presents a physical model for the volume and composition of melt produced by hydrous fluxing above subduction zones. The authors use thermal models to predict volumes and compositions of melts, providing insights into the behavior of fluids in subduction zones and the formation of magma.
