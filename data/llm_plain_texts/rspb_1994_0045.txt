tldr: This study examines the association between microfilaraemia and disease in lymphatic filariasis. Contrary to the conventional immunological explanation, the research finds no evidence for a negative association between infection and disease. Instead, the majority of studies show an equal propensity of disease in microfilaraemics and amicrofilaraemics, with more studies indicating a positive rather than a negative relation. The findings suggest that variations in local infection prevalence might underlie the observed between-study variability in the microfilaraemia-disease association.
