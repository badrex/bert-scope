tldr: The author, Captain C. M. Elliot, conducted a study to determine the influence of the moon on the barometric pressure at Singapore. By comparing the results with Colonel Sabine's work at St. Helena, Elliot found that the moon's effect on the barometer was slightly greater at Singapore, which is closer to the Equator.
