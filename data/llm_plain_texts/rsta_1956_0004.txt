tldr: The authors present a numerical method to calculate the potential distribution in the electric double layers of two identical spherical colloidal particles. They use the Manchester University Electronic Computer to obtain solutions for various particle radii, surface potentials, and particle separations. The results help in understanding the forces between colloidal particles and their impact on properties like diffusion, viscosity, and sedimentation.
