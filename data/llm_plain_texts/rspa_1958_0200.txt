semantic_tags:
  - Crystal Physics

  - Lattice Disorder
tldr: The author reviews the knowledge of hydrogen positions and physical properties in ice crystals, focusing on lattice disorder and its connection with the hydrogen arrangement. They discuss various properties, such as dielectric properties, electrical conductivity, proton magnetic resonance, mechanical relaxation, and self-diffusion, and propose that the observed time-independence of the ionic conductivity is due to the presence of ions and Bjerrum defects in ice crystals.
