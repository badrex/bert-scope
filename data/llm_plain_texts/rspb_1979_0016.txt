tldr: The article investigates the process of exocytotic shedding and glial uptake of photoreceptor membrane in salticid spiders. It reveals that photoreceptor membrane is lost through a process where microvilli lengthen, taper, and are received by endocytotic pits in the glial membrane. The detached coated vesicles containing photoreceptor membrane fragments accumulate in the glial processes as disorderly membranous detritus. This process is different from pinocytosis and provides a new understanding of membrane disposal in salticid spiders.
