tldr: The author examines the relationship between solar spotted area, terrestrial meteorology, and terrestrial magnetism. They find preliminary evidence suggesting that variations in solar activity may precede changes in weather and magnetism. Further research is needed to understand the connection and its potential for predicting meteorological changes.
