  - Pattern Regulation
  - Polar Coordinate Model
tldr: This article discusses insect leg development, pattern regulation, and regeneration, focusing on the polar coordinate model. It explains how insect legs develop from small regions of the embryonic thorax and how they differentiate in the embryo to form functional larval legs. The article also explores the process of pattern regulation and regeneration in insect legs, as well as the molecular mechanisms that may underlie a polar map of positional information.
