tldr: The author investigates the behavior of waves and vortices in fluids, particularly in water. They explore wave propagation, wave velocity, and the formation of coreless vortices when a solid object moves through an incompressible fluid. The study also includes the critical wave-length that gives minimum wave-velocity and the important properties of these cases.
