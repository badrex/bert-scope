tldr: The authors explore the possibility of comparing line standards of length through photographic methods, aiming to achieve higher precision and reduce labor compared to traditional visual methods. They propose a definition for the position of a line in a photographic image and discuss the potential advantages of this approach for measuring distances between lines on reference standards.
