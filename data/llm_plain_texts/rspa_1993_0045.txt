tldr: This article investigates the growth habits and rates of snow crystals, deriving equations for their growth rates based on air temperature, supersaturation, and terminal velocities. The study finds that the maximum attainable diameters of various snow crystal forms are in good agreement with observations, and provides a comprehensive review of the factors influencing snow crystal formation and habits.
