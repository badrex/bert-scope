tldr: The author investigates a new type of electric discharge, the disc discharge, observed in vacuum tubes containing helium with a small trace of another gas. The disc discharge exhibits unique characteristics, such as being unaffected by weak magnetic fields and showing a different spectrum than the green glow. The author also studies the structure and behavior of these discs, including their rotation and scattering properties.
