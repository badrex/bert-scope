tldr: The authors developed a balloon-borne selective chopper radiometer to measure atmospheric temperature from up to 35 km altitude. They tested the methods of selective absorption and selective chopping in the real atmosphere, providing valuable experience and data for the remote measurement of atmospheric temperature using satellite radiometers. The experiment aimed to obtain accurate weighting functions to interpret the results and improve the understanding of atmospheric temperature from satellites.
