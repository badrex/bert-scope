tldr: The authors discuss and analyze A.D. Walsh's paper on bond energies and bond lengths, focusing on the relationship between ionization potential and electronegativity. They argue that the choice of ionization potential is crucial for understanding bond properties and criticize the use of ground-state ionization potentials instead of valence-state ionization potentials. They also question the assumption of lone-pair repulsions and suggest that a deeper relationship between force-constant and dissociation energy of a bond may exist.
