tldr: This study investigates the effects of changing arousal levels on the spontaneous activity of cortical neurones in cats. The research focuses on the transition from relaxation to alarm and how it affects the discharge frequency and temporal pattern of neurones in the post-lateral and supra-sylvian gyri. The results show that when a cat is alarmed, the discharge frequency of certain cells in the post-lateral cortex decreases, while the temporal pattern of discharge changes for all cells, with the modal interval becoming longer and the geometric standard deviation becoming smaller. These findings support the idea that arousal levels can affect neuronal activity and that sleep may be one pole of a continuum of possible states of arousal.
