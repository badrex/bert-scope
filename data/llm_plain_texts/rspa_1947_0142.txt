tldr: The authors examine the relationship between cosmic radiation variations, meson disintegration, atmospheric pressure, and temperature. They find that the observed magnitudes and variations of the temperature and pressure effects can be explained by the theory of meson decay in the atmosphere. The study uses multiple correlation analysis to determine the correlation coefficients and regression coefficients for the effects of pressure and temperature on cosmic radiation intensity.
