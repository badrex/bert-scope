tldr: The author presents a method for investigating fossils using serial sectioning, a technique that involves grinding the fossil into thin, transparent slices. This method allows for a deeper understanding of the fossil's structure and can be used to reconstruct the fossil's original form. The author also describes the design and use of a grinding machine specifically designed for this purpose.
