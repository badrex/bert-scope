tldr: This study investigates the three-dimensional boundary layer on the end wall of a vortex chamber, focusing on the radial and circumferential components of velocity. The research provides new insights into the end-wall boundary layer flow and offers an empirical expression for the wall friction factor. The findings contribute to a better understanding of confined vortex flows and their applications.
