tldr: The study examines the cranial anatomy and functional morphology of Pliosaurus brachyspondylus, a large plesiosaur from the Upper Jurassic of Westbury, Wiltshire. The skull is long and low with a wide gape, narrow snout, and high temporal region. The dentition is robust and caniniform anteriorly, while the posterior teeth are hook-shaped to help move large prey items back into the gullet. The jaw musculature is specialized for biting and holding onto prey. The cranial skeleton is adapted to resist bending stresses, but there is no evidence for any adaptation to torsional resistance. Pliosaurus was likely an opportunistic feeder on a wide variety of prey, primarily relying on its large eyes for hunting.
