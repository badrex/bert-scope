tldr: 'James Keir's study on the crystallization of glass reveals that certain types of glass, like window glass and bottle glass, are more prone to crystallization due to their composition and fluidity. The process of crystallization changes the properties of glass, making it opaque, increasing its density, and reducing its brittleness. Keir also suggests that the loss of lighter and more fluid parts of the glass through evaporation may affect the crystallization process.'
