tldr: The authors compare experimental data on magnetic hysteresis with two phenomenological models. They find that the 'independent particle' model of Preisach and Everett accurately describes the observed behavior of minor loops in magnetic hysteresis. The model is further generalized to account for the interaction of particles through an average demagnetizing field, and a method for calculating its consequences is described.
