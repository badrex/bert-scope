tldr: This article presents a theory connecting the strength and porosity of hardened hydraulic cement pastes. The authors explain that cement strength is influenced by two types of pores: colloidal pores and crack-like pores. By controlling the porosity of cement products, they were able to create advanced cement-based materials with improved strength and toughness, competing with metals, plastics, and ceramics in some applications.
