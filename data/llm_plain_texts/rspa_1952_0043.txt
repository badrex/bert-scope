tldr: 'The study examines the adaptation of Bact. lactis aerogenea cultures to proflavine, a chemical compound, in the context of selection and induced adaptation theories. The presence of proflavine increases the lag before growth and reduces the number of colonies formed by unadapted cells. The adaptation process is accelerated when the drug is added gradually to an actively growing culture, suggesting that the interaction between the drug and the cell brings about adjustments that enable growth under previously inhibitory conditions. The rate of adaptation is dependent on the metabolic activity of the culture.'
