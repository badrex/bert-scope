tldr: The article demonstrates how to represent microscopic charge and current densities using polarization and magnetization fields. The author shows that these fields can be generated by two arbitrary differentiable fields, one scalar and one vector, and explains the transformation rules connecting different polarization and magnetization fields. This analysis helps in understanding the atomic field equations and the macroscopic Maxwell equations for bulk matter.
