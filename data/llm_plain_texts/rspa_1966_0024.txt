tldr: This article presents measurements of differential cross sections and polarization effects in pion-proton elastic scattering in the momentum range of 875 to 1579 MeV/c. The authors analyze the data using a series expansion in terms of Legendre polynomials and conclude that the resonances at 1030 and 1230 MeV are wave resonances with and spin respectively.
