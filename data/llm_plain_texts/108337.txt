tldr: The author, W.R. Grove, conducted experiments to study the decomposition of water using heat and the catalytic actions of various substances. He discovered that heat can overcome the affinity of water elements and separate them, and that substances like platinum, iridium, and osmium can also decompose water. The author also discussed the limitations of using other substances like silica and oxides for decomposition due to their reactions with water. This research contributes to the understanding of chemical reactions and the role of heat in decomposition processes.
