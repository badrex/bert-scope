tldr: 'Joseph Priestley conducted experiments to understand the composition of air and its reactions with water and metals. He discovered that when metals are heated in dephlogisticated air, they gain weight due to the absorption of air. This finding challenged the phlogiston theory and supported the idea that air is composed of multiple gases, including fixed air and dephlogisticated air.'
