tldr: Dr. Jurin's ninth dissertation discusses the motive forces of bodies, arguing that forces are proportional to the velocities of the bodies. He presents experiments and counterarguments to the opposing view, which claims that forces are proportional to the squares of the velocities. This debate is essential for understanding the foundations of classical mechanics.
