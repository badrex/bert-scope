tldr: The authors investigate the physical basis of the biological effects of high voltage radiations, focusing on the absorption processes and the role of high-speed electrons. They explore the differences between photoelectric and recoil absorption and their impact on the probability of an electron passage per unit energy absorption. The study provides insights into the mechanisms of high voltage radiation's biological effects and helps understand the complex relationship between radiation and living tissues.
