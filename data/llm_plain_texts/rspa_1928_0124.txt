tldr: The authors conducted experiments using the cathode ray oscillograph to measure metal overvoltages and transfer resistance. They found that metal overvoltages do not exist when a metal is being deposited, and the observed overvoltages in the iron group metals are actually hydrogen overvoltages. The results suggest that the high overvoltage characteristic of these metals is due to the formation of metallic hydrides on or in the electrode surface.
