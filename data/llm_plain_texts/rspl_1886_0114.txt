tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the effect of polishing the surface of Iceland spar on the reflected light's polarization. They used an elliptic analyzer and found that polishing the surface altered the state of the crystal, changing the ratio of the axes and the azimuth of the major axis of the polarized light. The results confirmed Seebeck's views on the use of polished surfaces.
