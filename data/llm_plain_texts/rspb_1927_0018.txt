tldr: The authors conducted experiments on adult mice to study the effects of X-rays on their ovaries. They found that X-ray exposure led to the complete degeneration of oocytes and the formation of sterile ovaries. The study also revealed that the germinal epithelium did not contribute to the tissues of the sterilized ovary, and all tissues were derived from the elements already present in the cortex at the time of irradiation. The findings provide insights into the effects of radiation on animal reproduction and fertility.
