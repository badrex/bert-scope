tldr: The authors propose a new approach to understanding light scattering in homogeneous media by considering it as regular Bragg reflexions from suitable elastic waves. They develop a mathematical model that reveals interesting features of light scattering, which are missed when the summation is replaced by integration. This approach provides a better understanding of the resolving power of elastic waves and the contribution of different waves to scattering.
