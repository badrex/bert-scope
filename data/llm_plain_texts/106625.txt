tldr: The author conducted experiments with freezing mixtures, focusing on the freezing of nitrous and vitriolic acids, and the production of cold. They discovered that the strength of the acid and the amount of snow used in the mixtures greatly affected the degree of cold produced. The author also tested various thermometers to determine their accuracy in measuring extreme cold.
