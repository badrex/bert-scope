tldr: 'The authors discovered that two species of nocturnal primates, the owl monkey and the bushbaby, lack colour vision due to mutations in their S-cone pigment genes. The owl monkey has a similar gene to the human S-cone pigment gene, while the bushbaby has a defective gene with deletions and insertions that cause a frame shift and result in a stop codon. These genetic defects explain the absence of colour vision in both species.'
