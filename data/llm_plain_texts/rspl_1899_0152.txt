tldr: The author, J. Chunder Bose, studied the effects of electric radiation on various substances, observing that some substances showed a decrease in contact resistance while others, like potassium, showed an increase. He proposed using positive and negative terms to distinguish these actions and found that sensitivity was confined to the outer surfaces in contact, not the substratum.
