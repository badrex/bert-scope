tldr: The author examines the evolutionary systematics of bivalve molluscs, specifically focusing on the classification and the bivalve gill. They analyze the composition of the latero-frontal tracts in various bivalve families and propose that the families with latero-frontal tracts consisting of simple cilia only should be included in the subclass Pteriomorphia. The study also discusses the differences in the gill form in various families and how it may be related to the composition of their latero-frontal tracts.
