tldr: The author, Henry R. Palmer, studied the movements of shingle beaches and identified three types of actions: accumulative, destructive, and progressive. These actions are caused by tidal currents and wave forces. Palmer observed these effects along the coastlines of Folkstone, Dover, Sandgate, and Sandwich Flats. He recommended a more general system of coastal management to prevent shingle accumulation and erosion.
