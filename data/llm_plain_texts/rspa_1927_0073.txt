tldr: This article presents a simplified approach to understanding the Zeeman effect and its relation to spherical harmonics. The author develops a model of a charged spinning spherical body moving in a central field of force and uses the variational method of Schrodinger to derive equations for the term levels in the Zeeman effect. The results provide a complete system of equations for determining the frequencies and intensities of lines in the standard Zeeman effect, applicable to both weak and strong fields.
