tldr: The author investigates matrices of integers associated with self-transformations of surfaces, focusing on non-singular quartic surfaces. They discuss the significance of solutions to a specific matrix equation and explore the relationship between these solutions and the Pell equation. The study has implications for understanding transformations and characteristics of surfaces in geometry.
