tldr: The author investigates the distribution of turbulent velocities near a solid wall in a fluid. They analyze two special cases of disturbances and compare the results with experimental observations. The study suggests that the unique features of the observed distribution may be due to the existence of fluctuating pressure gradients at the surface, which are transverse to the direction of mean flow and larger than the longitudinal pressure gradients.
