tldr: The authors developed a photoelectric method to measure the velocity of rapid chemical reactions. They studied the character of flow in an observation tube and analyzed the error in measuring bimolecular velocity constants due to deviations from mass flow. The method proved reliable for studying both bimolecular and unimolecular reactions, providing valuable insights into reaction kinetics.
