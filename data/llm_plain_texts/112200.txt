tldr: The author, Robert Mallet, conducted experiments on the compression of slate and quartz rocks to determine their actual wave-transmission velocity compared to the theoretical velocity based on their solid material. The results showed that nearly eight-ninths of the full velocity of wave-transmission is lost due to the heterogeneity and discontinuity of the rocky mass. The author also deduced practical conclusions for civil engineers and architects regarding the bearing power and proper direction of lamination in these rocks.
