tldr: This article discusses the efforts to preserve and catalog Britain's scientific and technological records, manuscripts, and historic scientific instruments. A Standing Joint Committee of the Royal Society and the Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts has been appointed to examine existing arrangements and make recommendations for action. A list or Guide will be prepared for publication, giving the location and summarizing the contents of collections of papers relating to outstanding figures in science and technology. Additionally, a national catalogue of historic scientific instruments will be created, with a focus on instruments of intrinsic importance or those associated with famous scientists or discoveries.
