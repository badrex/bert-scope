tldr: The authors conducted a theoretical and experimental investigation of the quadrupole interaction in the ground state of manganese. They found a non-zero quadrupole interaction due to relativistic effects, which was confirmed through their experimental measurements. This discovery provides a better understanding of the hyperfine structure of atoms with half-filled shells.
