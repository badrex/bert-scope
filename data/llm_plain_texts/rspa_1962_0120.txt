tldr: The authors studied the chemical components of the heartwood of the tree Ougeinia dalbergioides, commonly known as 'Tinsha'. They identified three main crystalline components: 4-dalbergioidin, homoferreirin, and ougenin. These compounds have different chemical structures and properties, and their presence in the heartwood contributes to the tree's durability and use in making furniture.
