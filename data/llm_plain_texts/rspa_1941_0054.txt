tldr: 'This article investigates the compressibility and repulsion potential of solid n-paraffins using X-ray diffraction. The author finds that the linear compressibilities in a plane normal to the chain axes are between 3 to 12 cdyne, while the compressibility in the direction of the chain is less than 3 cdyne. The repulsive forces between paraffin chains are mainly due to hydrogen shells surrounding the carbon chains, and the attraction between chain molecules is caused by van der Waals forces. The study provides insights into the forces acting between paraffin molecules and their structure.'
