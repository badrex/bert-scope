tldr: The study examines the changes in length and disk shedding rate of Xenopus rod outer segments during metamorphosis. The researchers found a dramatic decrease in rod outer segment length during the metamorphic climax, followed by a reversal and growth in length after metamorphosis. The findings suggest that these changes may influence the animal's scotopic sensitivity and have important effects on its visual physiology.
