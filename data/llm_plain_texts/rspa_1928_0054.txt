tldr: This study investigates the heating effects of thorium and radium products by comparing the observed and calculated heatings. The authors found that the results indicate an agreement between the observed and calculated heatings to within 2% for each case, and the absolute values correspond very closely to the value of the alpha particles emitted per second by a gram of radium. The research provides insights into the energy released by radioactive substances and helps to understand the heating effects caused by alpha, beta, and gamma radiations.
