tldr: The author investigates the poisonous properties of Lotus arabicus and identifies that the poison is due to the prussic acid formed when the plant is crushed with water. They study the properties and chemical constitution of lotoflavin and lotusin, as well as the properties of lotase in relation to other hydrolytic enzymes. The authors also analyze the amount of prussic acid in plants at different stages of growth and find that it reaches its maximum at the seeding period.
