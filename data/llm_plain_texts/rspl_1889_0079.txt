tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine if green plants could assimilate carbon from certain organic compounds, specifically aldehydes. They found that while some aldehydes, like glycerin, could be converted into starch, others, like formic aldehyde, could not. This study contributed to the understanding of how plants synthesize carbohydrates and the role of aldehydes in the process.
