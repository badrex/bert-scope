revised_title: 'Suppression of Transmitter Release at the Neuromuscular Junction: A Comparative Study with Squid Synapse'
semantic_tags:
  - Neuromuscular junction
  - Transmitter release
  - Vertebrate endplates
  - Squid synapse
  - Calcium ions
tldr: The authors conducted experiments on frog and rat endplates to study the suppression of transmitter release at the neuromuscular junction. They found that under suitable conditions, a suppression effect similar to that observed at the squid synapse can be demonstrated at the vertebrate neuromuscular junction. This phenomenon is attributed to the interposition of an electric potential barrier that opposes the entry of calcium ions, which are the normal prerequisite for transmitter release.
