tldr: This study investigates the thermal decomposition of branched-chain paraffin hydrocarbons, including iso-butane, iso-pentane, and neo-pentane. The authors found that these hydrocarbons decompose partly by radical chain reactions and partly by molecular reactions. The molecular decomposition persists even when the chain reactions are suppressed by nitric oxide. The decomposition rates of these branched-chain paraffins are similar to ethane and differ from their normal isomers.
