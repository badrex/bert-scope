tldr: The authors present a new method for solving the wave equation in space of any odd number of dimensions without using devices for evaluating divergent integrals. This method is then applied to the regular Cauchy problem for the Euler-Poisson-Darboux equation, providing a simpler approach than previous methods. The new method relies on a function that behaves similarly to the elementary solution of the wave equation and can be used to solve the problem for any odd number of dimensions.
