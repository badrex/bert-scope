tldr: This article discusses the possible existence of biologically active soil cover before the late Silurian and how it may have influenced the colonization of vascular plants. It explores the role of microbial communities, such as cyanobacteria and fungi, in soil formation and weathering, and how these processes may have been affected by the appearance of early vascular plants.
