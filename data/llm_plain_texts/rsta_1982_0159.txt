tldr: This study investigates the behavior of elastico-viscous fluids in complex flow systems, using the Boger fluid as a model. The research highlights the opposing influences of fluid inertia and elasticity, and how slight geometrical asymmetries can dramatically affect the flow field in elastic liquids compared to Newtonian fluids. The authors also discuss the challenges in simulating and controlling these complex flows, and suggest future directions for research.
