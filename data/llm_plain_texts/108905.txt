tldr: The author, Henry E. Roscoe, conducted research on vanadium compounds and discovered that the true formula of vanadic acid is V2O5, not V2O3 as previously believed by Berzelius. This new understanding of vanadium's atomic weight and composition led to a better understanding of its properties and compounds.
