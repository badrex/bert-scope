tldr: This article studies the performance of wave-power devices, focusing on asymmetric structures, by generalizing the existing theory of ship dynamics. The author compares the performance of two different devices, the Salter duck and a two-pontoon system, and finds that they have similar potential operating efficiencies if appropriate scales are chosen. The study also highlights the importance of considering the structure's freedom to move in multiple degrees of freedom for better performance.
