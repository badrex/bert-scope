tldr: The authors investigate the mechanism of melting in group I nitrates, focusing on the thermodynamic features and crystal structures. They suggest that the low melting points of these nitrates are due to the formation of association complexes in the nitrate melts, which contribute to the overall entropy of fusion without significantly increasing the heat of fusion. This explanation is supported by the abnormal activation energies for the viscosities of molten nitrates and the small volume changes of fusion.
