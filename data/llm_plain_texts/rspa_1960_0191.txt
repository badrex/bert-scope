tldr: This article investigates the formation of crystal compounds of graphite by anodic oxidation using concentrated sulfuric acid. The authors discuss changes in electrical resistance in relation to two-dimensional electron energy band structure models. They also study the effects of crystal defects and compare the results with other acid salts of graphite, such as perchlorate and trifluoroacetate.
