tldr: The authors studied the initiation of vinyl polymerization by manganic acetylacetonato and related manganic chelates, finding that the process involves free-radical intermediates. They discovered that the initiation process is essentially the scission of a ligand as a free-radical, with a change in the oxidation number of the metal. The authors also found that manganic 1,1,1-trifluoroacetylacetonate has unique properties, selectively initiating polymerization of certain monomers.
