tldr: The authors studied the dielectric loss in polyethylene and related hydrocarbon polymers at low temperatures. They discovered a relaxation peak at audio frequencies and explained the experimental results using a simple quantum mechanical model. The model suggests that the loss is attributed to hydroxyl rotation in the crystalline regions of the polymers.
