tldr: The author, Thomas Wharton Jones, examines the changes that occur in mammalian ova after impregnation. He describes the development of the chorion and the role of the vitellary membrane in the process. The study includes observations on the development of ova in various animals, including humans, and concludes with the disappearance of the germinal vesicle being prior to impregnation.
