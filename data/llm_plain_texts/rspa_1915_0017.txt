tldr: The authors present a bolometric method to measure the radiant efficiency of radiating bodies, specifically gas fires. They replace the radiometer-cum-thermopile device in the Leeds method with a simple bolometer, which offers greater accuracy, sensitivity, and ease of use. The new method allows for better determination of the total radiation emitted by a fire and its distribution factor, which is crucial for understanding the efficiency of heating systems.
