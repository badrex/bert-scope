revised_title: Temperature Effects on Ionization in Gases
semantic_tags:
  - Ionization

  - Gas ionization
  - Gas properties
tldr: This article investigates the effect of temperature on ionization in gases, particularly air, methyl iodide, and ethyl bromide, when exposed to Rontgen rays. The authors found that ionization in a gas is independent of temperature when the gas is kept at constant density. This study helps to understand the behavior of gases and vapors under different conditions.
