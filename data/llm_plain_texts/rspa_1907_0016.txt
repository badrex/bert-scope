tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the length of the cathode dark space in various gases, such as hydrogen, nitrogen, air, and oxygen, under different current densities and pressures. They found that the dark space's length decreases with increased current density and concluded that it can be considered a region of positive electrification traveling towards the cathode, where the total positive charge balances the negative charge on the cathode.
