tldr: The author, Charles Babbage, conducted experiments to explore the relationship between electricity and magnetism. He discovered that rotations could be produced by electrifying objects and rotating them near a plate, and that the effect was more pronounced with slower rotations. Babbage also observed that screens and heat could influence the rotations, and he proposed a theory based on the non-instantaneous communication of electricity.
