tldr: This study confirms the existence of a difference in osmotic pressure between the yolk and white of a hen's egg. It also reveals an osmotic gradient within the yolk, with lower osmotic pressure near the surface and higher pressure inside. The vitelline membrane maintains a small, if any, difference in osmotic pressure. Additionally, mixing yolk and white causes a reaction that forms a precipitate, reducing the osmotic pressure of the mixture. The thermoelectric method of measuring vapour pressures is found to be reliable when used with caution.
