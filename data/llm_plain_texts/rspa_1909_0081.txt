revised_title: 'The Accumulation of Helium in Geological Time: Progress and Preliminary Experiments'
semantic_tags:
  - Helium accumulation
  - Geological time measurement
  - Radioactive decay
  - Iron ores
  - Thorium and uranium series
tldr: The author investigates the accumulation of helium in geological materials, focusing on iron ores and phosphatised bones. They find that these materials can provide information about geological time, but also note the need for more direct data on the rate of helium formation. The author also discusses preliminary experiments on the rate of helium growth from thorianite.
