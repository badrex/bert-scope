tldr: The author conducted experiments to prove the existence of interspersed vacuum by comparing the fall of a Guinea and a piece of paper in a glass receiver. They found that when the air was pumped out, both the Guinea and the paper reached the bottom at the same time, demonstrating a decrease in the quantity of matter and the presence of interspersed vacuum. This experiment challenged the plenist beliefs of the time and provided evidence for the existence of vacuum.
