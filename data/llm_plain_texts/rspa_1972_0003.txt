tldr: The authors studied the photoelectron spectra of methane, silane, germane, and stannane, and found that ionization from valence and orbitals analogous to the and orbitals of the corresponding inert gases caused the observed spectra. The vibrational patterns of the bands were a simple progression of the breathing vibration, and the bond lengths and angles of the ionized states were estimated from the structures and intensities of the band patterns.
