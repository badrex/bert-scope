tldr: The author presents a method for calculating the irreducible characters of a collineation group in five dimensions, focusing on a primitive collineation group of order 28.36.5.7. The method involves using Diophantine equations and the properties of algebraic conjugates to determine the characters of the group. This approach has potential for further applications in various groups, but its success and limitations remain to be explored.
