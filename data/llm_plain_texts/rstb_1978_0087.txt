tldr: This article examines the regulation of gibberellin (GA) synthesis and metabolism in plants, focusing on the role of subcellular compartments in biosynthesis, metabolism, and release of GAs. The importance of -kaurene synthetase and its regulation for GA production is emphasized, as well as factors influencing oxidation steps and hydroxylation steps. The article also discusses the role of plastids in GA biosynthesis and release, and the effects of light on GA levels in plant tissues.
