tldr: The author investigates the filtration of crystalloids and colloids through gelatine, focusing on the behavior of hemolysins. They find that gelatine filters are not a simple means of separating crystalloids from colloids and that the filtration process can be affected by the state of the filter. The study has implications for understanding toxin-antitoxin reactions and the nature of toxins in general.
