tldr: This article describes the preliminary experiments and properties of aluminium methide and ethide, two organometallic compounds. The authors synthesized these compounds by reacting mercuric methide and ethide with aluminium, and they studied their chemical reactions, properties, and molecular formulas. The findings contribute to the understanding of organometallic chemistry and the classification of elements.
