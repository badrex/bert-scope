tldr: The article discusses an enzyme system found in pea seeds that breaks down and synthesizes starch. The study reveals that glucose-1-phosphate is the first recognizable step in the phosphorylation of starch, and this process is reversible. The enzyme system also converts glucose-1-phosphate into reducing hexose-monophosphates, which are then transformed into hexose-diphosphate. This complex set of reactions is essential for understanding carbohydrate metabolism in plants.
