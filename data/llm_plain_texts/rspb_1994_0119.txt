tldr: The author investigates the function of the elongated tail streamers in swallows, finding that they enhance aerodynamic efficiency and flight maneuverability. The streamers cause an automatic downward deflection of the tail's leading edge, delaying flow separation and allowing for higher lift before stall, improving maneuverability and enabling tighter turns.
