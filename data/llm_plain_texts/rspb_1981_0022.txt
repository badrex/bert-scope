tldr: This article discusses the critical factors that limit the performance of the visual system, focusing on the eye's design and the visual cortex's processing. The author explains how understanding these limitations can help clarify the tasks performed by the central parts of the visual system. The article also explores the importance of optical design in nature and how it relates to the eye's resolving power and sensitivity.
