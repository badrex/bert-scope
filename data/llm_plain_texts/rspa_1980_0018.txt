tldr: This article discusses the principles and performance of a 600 kV high-resolution electron microscope. It covers the requirements for high-resolution imaging, including electrical, mechanical, and thermal stability, as well as the design of the electron optical system, illumination, and image recording. The author describes the microscope's construction and its potential for achieving resolutions of 2.0 Å (at 600 kV) and 1.5 Å with image processing. Initial results from thin specimens of minerals, metal particles, and metallic glasses demonstrate that this performance is already closely approached.
