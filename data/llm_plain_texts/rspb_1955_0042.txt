tldr: This article discusses the concept of hybrid vigor and its expression in Drosophila subobscura. The authors study the genetic control of chromosome behavior and its consequences, particularly in relation to inbreeding depression. They find that Drosophila subobscura has a high degree of genetic heterozygosity, which leads to rapid declines in vigor on inbreeding. The authors also investigate the failure of eggs to hatch in different inbred lines and explore the role of genetic drift and founder effects in these differences.
