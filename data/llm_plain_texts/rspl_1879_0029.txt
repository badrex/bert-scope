tldr: This article investigates the chemical equivalence of nickelous and cobaltous sulphates through various experimental methods. The authors find that nickelous hydrate carries down sodic sulfate, while cobaltous hydrate carries down cobaltous sulfate. The study provides insights into the precipitation chemistry and analytical methods for separating and quantifying these two compounds.
