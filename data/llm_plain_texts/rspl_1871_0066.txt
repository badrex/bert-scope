tldr: This article investigates the specific heat and other physical characteristics of mixtures of methylic alcohol and water. The author presents experiments and findings on the heat evolved or absorbed during the formation of these mixtures, providing tables of results and discussing the relationship between the specific heat of mixtures and the heat evolved during their formation. The study also explores the potential for comparing the specific heat of liquid and solid substances under similar conditions and discovering new relations between them.
