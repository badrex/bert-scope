tldr: The author investigates trigonometrical series and their Cesaro partial summations, proving that if the upper and lower functions of these summations are summable and finite, the trigonometrical series converges to a Fourier series. This work extends Riemann's theorem and provides a more comprehensive understanding of Fourier series convergence.
