tldr: The authors developed a general valence force field for diamond, relating the force constants of a valence force field to the macroscopic elastic constants and Raman frequency of diamond-type crystals. They found that the interaction constant associating bond extension with angular deformation is most significantly altered in the diamond structure, but more accurate conclusions require improved experimental determinations of the elastic constants.
