tldr: The author investigates the locomotor system of medusae, focusing on their nervous system and muscle contractions. They discovered that artificial rhythm can be induced through faradaic stimulation, which can help understand the physiology of these primitive organisms. The author also found that the rate and regularity of the artificial rhythm can be controlled by adjusting the strength of the current and the part of the tissue being stimulated.
