tldr: The authors studied magnetic relaxation and resonance in cobalt-doped magnesium oxide to understand the spin-lattice relaxation and cross-relaxation processes. They found that the relaxation was faster than expected, and the presence of iron impurities and cobalt ions played a significant role in the relaxation process. The authors also discovered two main cross-relaxation processes involving two and four cobalt ions.
