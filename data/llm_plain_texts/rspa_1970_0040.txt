tldr: This article presents a theoretical treatment of heat flow in liquid helium in the transition region. The authors use a Boltzmann equation approach to explain the heat flow and provide a mathematical model for the heat transfer in liquid helium. They also discuss the boundary conditions and the effect of phonon-phonon interactions on heat flow. The results of the study agree with experimental data within a few parts per cent, providing valuable insights into the behavior of heat flow in liquid helium.
