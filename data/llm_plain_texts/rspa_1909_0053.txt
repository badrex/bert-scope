tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the number of ions produced by an alpha particle along its entire path. They used a method that involved measuring the ionization current at low pressure and a small portion of the alpha particle's range. The results showed that the ionization produced by an alpha particle decreases as it travels through its path.
