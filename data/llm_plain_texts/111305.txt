tldr: The author, William Thomson, explores the phenomenon of peristaltic induction of electric currents in elongated conductors, such as submarine telegraph cables. He explains how changes in electrostatic potential in the surrounding matter can induce electric currents in the conductors. This study helps in understanding the behavior of electric currents in telegraph cables and improving their performance.
