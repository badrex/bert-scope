tldr: This article discusses the experimental limits on particle candidates for dark matter, focusing on neutrinos as the only known particles that could be potential candidates. The author reviews the evidence about neutrino mass and discusses the limits on other candidates like magnetic monopoles and supersymmetric particles, such as the photino. The article also briefly mentions a calorimetric detector that could be used to detect dark-matter candidates.
