tldr: This paper investigates the frequency distribution and correlation of barometric heights at various stations. The authors use statistical methods to analyze the data and identify the constants that best describe local barometric frequency. They also discuss the potential applications of their findings, such as predicting future barometric heights based on past observations at other stations.
