tldr: This article discusses the evolution of the early Precambrian crust in Southern Africa, focusing on the greenstone belts and their geological features. The authors analyze the geology of the Barberton Mountain Land and surrounding granite terrain, examining the stratigraphy, geochemistry, and tectonic history of the region. They compare the greenstone belts to modern island arcs and discuss the development of the early Precambrian crust in the context of plate tectonics.
