tldr: The author, Sir Benjamin Thompson, conducted experiments on colored shadows and found that the colors of shadows are determined by the different qualities of light used to illuminate them. He discovered that shadows appear yellow when illuminated by candlelight and blue when illuminated by daylight. The author also found that the colors of shadows can be reversed by using colored glass to alter the light source. This research sheds light on the relationship between light, color, and shadow formation.
