tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of heat and pressure on paraffins. They discovered that paraffins can be decomposed into liquid hydrocarbons by heating and applying pressure. The process involves distilling the paraffin multiple times, which results in the formation of various mixtures of hydrides and olefines. This research provides insight into the constitution of higher hydrocarbons and the potential for further study of the decomposition of other hydrocarbons.
