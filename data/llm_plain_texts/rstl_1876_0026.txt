tldr: The author conducted experiments on the magnetization of steel wires and discovered that applying stress to the wire reduces its magnetization, while removing stress increases it. This effect was more pronounced when the magnetization was solely residual, leading to the conclusion that stress influences the magnetic properties of metals.
