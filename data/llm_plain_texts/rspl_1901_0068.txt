tldr: The author examines the prothalli of Ophioglossum, Helminthostachys, and Psilotum, describing their external morphology and structure. They found that the prothalli of these plants have unique characteristics, such as the presence of antheridia and archegonia, and the distribution of an endophytic fungus. This research contributes to the understanding of the gametophyte stage in the life cycle of these plants.
