tldr: The author, Charles Wheatstone, conducted experiments to measure the velocity and duration of electric light. By using a rapidly rotating mirror and a series of experiments, he determined that the electric spark had a duration of 24,000th of a second. This research helped to further understand the properties of electricity.
