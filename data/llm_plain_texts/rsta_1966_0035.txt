tldr: The article discusses the deformation of solids by liquid impact and its relation to various real-world applications. The authors apply dislocation etching techniques to study liquid impacts and explore the effects of different liquids on solid materials. They find that the damage caused by liquid impacts is the cumulative effect of small increments of lattice deformation, which can be observed through dislocation loops. The study has implications for understanding rain damage in aircraft, blade erosion in steam turbines, and cavitation erosion.
