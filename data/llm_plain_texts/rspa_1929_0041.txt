tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the selective hydrogenation of higher polyethylenic esters, focusing on the position of ethylenic linkages in the molecules. They found that the process is selective based on the degree of unsaturation and the position of the ethylenic linkages. The results have implications for understanding contact action at solid surfaces and the potential for improving selective hydrogenation processes in the future.
