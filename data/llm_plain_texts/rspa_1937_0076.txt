tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the development of surface cracks in glasses, particularly in pyrex and quartz glass, using sodium vapor. They found that freshly drawn glass showed very few cracks, while older glass had many. The presence of surface cracks could explain the difference in mechanical strength between fresh and old glass. The authors also observed that the cracks were not caused by scratches or drawing marks.
