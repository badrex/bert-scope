tldr: The author examines the coalescence of amoeboid cells into plasmodia in various invertebrates, such as sea urchins, worms, and crustaceans. They observe that a kind of coagulation occurs, leading to the formation of plasmodia, which is similar to the process seen in Myxomycetes. This study suggests that the ability to coalesce with other cells to form plasmodia is a widespread property of amoeboid cells.
