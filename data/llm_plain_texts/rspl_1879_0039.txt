tldr: The authors explore the mineral, structural, and chemical characters of ophites and related rocks, focusing on their origin and the changes they undergo. They argue that these rocks are formed through chemical reactions and are not the result of chemical precipitations from ancient seas. They also discuss the rarity of limestones in formations immediately succeeding the Archaean period and the role of water in the formation of these rocks.
