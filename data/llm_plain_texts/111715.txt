tldr: The author, A.W. Hofmann, conducted experiments on the phosphorus-bases and polyatomic bases, focusing on the derivatives of triethylphosphine. They discovered that the reaction between dibromide of ethylene and triethylphosphine produced four different compounds, which represent the four groups of compounds that can arise from the mutual reaction between ammonia and dibromide of ethylene. This research sheds light on the nature of polyatomic bases and provides insights into the potential development of these compounds.
