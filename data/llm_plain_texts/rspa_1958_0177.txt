tldr: The author presents a method to solve non-linear waves in sloping channels using elliptic integrals. They transform the problem into a horizontal channel, allowing for easier calculations and obtaining the exact solution for the water wave in a sloping channel produced by the sudden release of a triangular wedge of water. The method can be applied to various problems related to surface run-off and flash floods.
