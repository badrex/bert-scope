tldr: The authors discovered a substance in a clay pit and studied the effects of Diss Mere water on various substances immersed in it. They found that the water caused corrosion and the formation of a metallic stain on copper and other substances. The analysis of the water revealed the presence of copper, sulfur, and iron compounds. This research contributed to the understanding of the chemical processes occurring in the Diss Mere area.
