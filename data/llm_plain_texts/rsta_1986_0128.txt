tldr: This article reviews the observational evidence for dark matter in spiral galaxies and discusses the hypothesis that luminous matter alone is responsible for the circular velocity in the inner region of the galaxy. The authors find that the presence of dark matter is necessary to account for the observed rotation curves in the outer regions of the galaxies, with some galaxies requiring at least four times as much dark matter as luminous matter. The maximum-disc hypothesis, which assumes constant mass-to-light ratios for bulge and disc, is supported by various constraints on the relative amounts of dark and luminous matter in the inner regions.
