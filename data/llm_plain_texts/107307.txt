tldr: The author examines the structure of the organ of hearing in a young humpback whale and discovers a unique mechanism not found in other animals. The whale's membrana tympani is convex and projects into the meatus externus, with a layer of muscular fibers covering its embossed part. This differs from the structure in other animals, including the elephant, where the central part is tendinous. The author also describes the large cavity behind the membrana tympani, the Eustachian tube, and the other parts of the organ, such as the vestibulum, semi-circular canals, and cochlea.
