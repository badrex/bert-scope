tldr: This article presents high-pressure density and specific heat measurements of CO2 between 70 and 3000 atmospheres. The authors used an altered apparatus to fill the piezometer under pressure, allowing them to measure isotherms in a larger range of densities. They found that the specific heat of CO2 increases with increasing density, and discussed the implications of their findings in the context of thermodynamics.
