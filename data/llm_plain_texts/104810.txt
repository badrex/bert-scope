tldr: This letter from J. Durant to Robert Boyle describes a coal-mine fire near Newcastle upon Tyne, the blue well, and a subterranean cavern in Weredale. The fire started from a candle and has caused significant devastation to the land and mines. Durant also mentions a blue powder found near the blue well and the unique geological features of the caverns, which require the use of candles for navigation due to their darkness and the constant dripping water.
