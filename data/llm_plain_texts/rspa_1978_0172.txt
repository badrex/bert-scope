tldr: This article investigates oscillatory viscous flows in channels and pipes with walls that are slightly perturbed from the straight and parallel case. The authors analyze the flow using linearized equations of motion and obtain asymptotic solutions for small and large Reynolds numbers. They also consider non-periodic distortions of the walls at arbitrary Reynolds numbers and provide examples of shear and pressure gradient distributions.
