tldr: The article discusses the strong connections between Sir Hans Sloane and French scientists during the 17th and 18th centuries. Sloane studied in France and maintained a lifelong correspondence with French scientists, including Joseph Pitton de Tournefort, Guichard-Joseph du Verney, Pierre Chirac, and Pierre Magnol. These relationships fostered collaboration and the exchange of knowledge between English and French scientists despite the political tensions between their countries at the time. Sloane's experiences in France influenced his approach to botany and natural history, and he became a prominent collector of his time.
