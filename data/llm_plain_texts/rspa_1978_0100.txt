tldr: This article investigates the effects of stable stratification in the free-stream on boundary layer flow over hills. The triple-deck analysis is extended to include stratification, and the linearized three-dimensional flow shows that gravity waves generated in the outer region have a significant influence on the flow in the boundary layer due to the interactive nature of the triple-deck structure. Numerical solutions reveal the inhibition of separation by stratification and larger amplitudes of generated gravity waves than expected from linearized theory.
