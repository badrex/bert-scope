tldr: The authors studied the effects of isotope substitution and thermal expansion in furoic acid crystals. They found that substituting deuterium for hydrogen in the crystals led to an expansion along the direction of the hydrogen bonds. The thermal expansion, however, was found to be largely determined by van der Waals forces between the dimers and had no direct relation to the isotope expansion. This research confirmed that short hydrogen bonds, even in isolated pairs, show the usual isotope effects, but they do not control the thermal expansion.
