tldr: The Ariane program, initiated in 1973, aimed to provide Europe with an independent launch capability for geostationary telecommunications satellites. The Ariane 1 rocket was successfully launched in 1979, and subsequent versions, Ariane 2, 3, and 4, were developed to improve performance and capabilities. The Ariane program has introduced competition in the satellite launch industry, with a focus on cost-effectiveness and meeting market demands. Arianespace, a private company, was established to commercialize Ariane, making it the first commercial company to sell satellite launches worldwide.
