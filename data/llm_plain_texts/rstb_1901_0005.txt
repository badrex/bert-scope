tldr: This article explores the electrical response and "blaze currents" of the frog's eye to both light and electrical stimulation. The author discovers that the retina plays a significant role in the response to light, while other tissues in the eyeball contribute to the response to electrical stimulation. The study also reveals the influence of pressure and weak constant currents on the eye's response.
