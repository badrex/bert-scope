tldr: 'The study investigates the relationship between gonadic structure and plumage characterisation in domestic fowls. Researchers found that gonadectomy in both sexes resulted in a male-like plumage after a moult. The endocrine function of the gonads, specifically the ovarian hormone, was believed to inhibit the development of cocky-feathering. However, the case study of a hen with testis grafts and ovarian remnants challenges this interpretation, questioning the validity of the endocrine theory in relation to gonad structure and plumage characterisation.'
