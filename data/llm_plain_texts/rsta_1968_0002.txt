tldr: The article discusses the Quaternary deposits of central Leicestershire, focusing on the glacial drifts and river terraces in the area. The authors describe the complex succession of sand, gravel, and water-laid sediments, and correlate the deposits with those described by Shotton in Warwickshire. They conclude that most of the drifts belong to the Saalian glaciation, with some temporary melt phases and still-water sedimentation. The authors also examine the geological history, previous research, and methods employed in their study, providing insights into the region's geology and geomorphology.
