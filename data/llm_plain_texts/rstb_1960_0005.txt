tldr: This article examines the fine structure of the insect ear, specifically the sensory units and accessory cells, using electron microscopy. The study focuses on the locust's ear, which has a pair of ear drums and an auditory ganglion containing about 70 bipolar sensory neurons. The research confirms previous light microscopy observations and reveals new structures in the sensory units, such as the cilium, scolopale, and various satellite cells. These findings contribute to understanding the transducer mechanism involved in the insect ear and its role in auditory perception.
