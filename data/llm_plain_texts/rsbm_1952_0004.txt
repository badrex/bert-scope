tldr: 'Robert Broom was a Scottish biologist and paleontologist who made significant contributions to the study of marsupials and Karroo fossils in South Africa. He worked on the anatomy of marsupials in Australia before returning to Scotland and later moving to South Africa, where he collected numerous fossil reptiles and contributed to the understanding of the evolution of mammals. Broom also held a professorship in Zoology and Geology at Stellenbosch and later became the Curator of Fossil Vertebrates and Anthropology at the Transvaal Museum.'
