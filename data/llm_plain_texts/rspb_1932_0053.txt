tldr: The authors conducted experiments on cats and monkeys to study the distribution of spinal terminals in the pyramidal tract using the method of experimental degeneration. They found that the terminals, or boutons, are present in the grey matter and are more common in the dorsal horn than in the ventral horn. The study also revealed that the density of boutons is higher in cats than in monkeys, and that the terminals are not connected to the cells they surround through protoplasmic continuity.
