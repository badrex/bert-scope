tldr: The author proves uniqueness and solvability theorems for the two-dimensional Neumann-Kelvin problem in the case of a body partly immersed in a supercritical stream. Two versions of the source method are developed to find a solution, ensuring the existence of unique solutions. The study focuses on the fluid dynamics and hydrodynamics of the problem, providing insights into the behavior of the fluid around a surface-piercing body.
