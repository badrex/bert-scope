tldr: The study investigates the oxidative phosphorylation and cellular metabolism in the livers of normal and malnourished infants. The research found that while respiration was well maintained in malnourished livers, phosphorylation was slightly reduced, and the uptake of phosphate into phosphatidic acid was greatly reduced. The findings suggest that the reduction in phosphorylation may result from the uncoupling action of free fatty acids or some other lipid derivative, potentially leading to irreversible damage at the cellular level in severe cases of malnutrition.
