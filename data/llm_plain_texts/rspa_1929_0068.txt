tldr: This article presents the experimental results and methodology for determining the equilibrium conditions of the methyl alcohol-hydrogen-carbonic oxide system at temperatures and pressures relevant to the commercial production of pure methyl alcohol. The authors used two independent methods to approach equilibrium from both synthesis and decomposition of methyl alcohol, and they describe the design and operation of the high-pressure apparatus used in their experiments.
