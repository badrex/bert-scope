tldr: The authors studied the structure and expression of integrated viral DNA in mouse cells transformed by simian virus 40 (SV40). They isolated and characterized the integrated viral DNA and flanking cellular sequences from several transformed cell lines. The mRNAs transcribed from the integrated viral DNA templates were analyzed, revealing that integrating the viral genome into the cellular chromosome can significantly alter its transcription pattern. This research provides insights into the mechanisms of viral transformation and the complex interactions between virus and host molecules.
