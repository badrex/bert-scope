tldr: This article presents the results of magnetic observations conducted at various stations on the coasts of the British Isles in 1907. The observations aimed to compare the values of secular change in declination, horizontal force, and inclination with those at Kew Observatory. The results show that the mean value of declination for the British Isles is 0.2 greater than at Kew, while the mean horizontal force change appears to be 3° less. The study also highlights the differences in values between sea and shore observations and the need for further investigation.
