tldr: The author investigates the dependence of radiation on temperature using electrical methods and discovers that the resistance of a platinum wire can be expressed as a linear function of its temperature. The findings show that the temperature of the sun is approximately 27,800 degrees Celsius, which is in close agreement with previous estimates.
