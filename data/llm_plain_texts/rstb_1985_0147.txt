tldr: The author examines the preservation and taphonomy of marine vertebrates in the Lower Oxford Clay (Middle Jurassic) of central England. They identify five types of vertebrate preservation and discuss the factors affecting preservation, such as current activity, oxygen content of sediment pore waters, and substrate firmness. The study provides insights into the palaeoecological and sedimentological significance of these extraordinary fossil biotas.
