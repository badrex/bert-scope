tldr: The author investigates the phenomenon of intermittent vision, where an object appears to momentarily stop or move in the opposite direction of its actual motion. They study this effect using a rotating disc with radial lines and find that the appearance of the lines changes based on the speed of rotation. The author suggests that this phenomenon could be explained by a periodic but rapidly extinguished paralysis of the perception of light due to mechanical shock. The main interest lies in the definite period involved, which could be related to the mechanical period of the head or a period belonging to the brain or nerves.
