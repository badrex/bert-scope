tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the long-range particles emitted by active deposits of radium, thorium, and actinium. They discovered two new sets of particles with definite ranges, which were emitted by the active deposits themselves rather than being produced by the passage of alpha-rays through matter. The experiments were also conducted in carbon dioxide to test if the main body of alpha-rays could produce long-range particles by disintegrating air molecules, but the results showed that the particles were emitted by the source.
