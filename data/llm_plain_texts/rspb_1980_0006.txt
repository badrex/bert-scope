tldr: The study investigates the neuroendocrine control of gonadotrophin release in Japanese quail, focusing on the role of the tuberal and anterior hypothalamus in controlling ovarian development and ovulation. The research explores the regulation of both 'tonic' gonadotrophin secretion and the cyclic surge of luteinizing hormone (LH) that causes ovulation. The results indicate that the hypothalamic control of ovarian function in quail is complex and involves multiple regions within the hypothalamus.
