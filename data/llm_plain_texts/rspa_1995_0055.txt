tldr: This paper investigates the Gray-Yang model of hydrocarbon oxidation, a thermokinetic or chain-thermal model that explains various observed phenomena in the oxidation process. The authors analyze the model using a combination of analytical and numerical techniques, finding stable and unstable limit-cycle behavior. They also show that under certain conditions, there exists a narrow band of parameter space where two Hopf bifurcation points are possible, leading to large and small unstable limit cycles. This occurs in a region with three equilibrium points.
