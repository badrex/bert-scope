tldr: The authors prove that a stationary, asymptotically flat space-time is analytic near spatial infinity, and that there exists a multipole expansion for it. The terms of this expansion are uniquely determined by the Geroch-Hansen multipole moments. This work generalizes previous results and confirms the usefulness of multipole moments in understanding static, asymptotically flat solutions.
