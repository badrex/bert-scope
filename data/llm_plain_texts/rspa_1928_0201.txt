tldr: The authors describe a method for investigating the sorption of carbon tetrachloride at low pressures by activated charcoals. They define the conditions necessary to obtain true equilibrium data and present a detailed explanation of the experimental setup and procedures. The study aims to improve our understanding of sorption theory and the practical applications of charcoal in various fields.
