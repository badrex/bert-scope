tldr: This article explores the relationship between phosphorescence decay curves and trap distributions in solids. The authors develop a theory that explains how the observed decay laws are related to trap distributions and confirm it through experiments using zinc sulfide phosphors. The findings provide a detailed explanation of long-period phosphorescence and its connection to thermoluminescence.
