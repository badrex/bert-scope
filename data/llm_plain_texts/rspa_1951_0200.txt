revised_title: 'Motion of Test Particles in General Relativity'
semantic_tags:
  - General Relativity
  - Gravitational Field
  - Test Particles
  - Equations of Motion
  - Spinning Particles
tldr: The authors derive the equations of motion for spinning test particles in a given gravitational field using the method of Fock. They focus on the motion of pole-dipole particles, which include spinning particles, and discuss the implications of their findings for physical problems and the accuracy of the equations of motion.
