revised_title: The Relation between Refraction and Chemical Equivalents of Elements
semantic_tags:
  - Atomic Refractions
  - Chemical Equivalents
  - Specific Refractions
  - Metallic Elements
  - Refractive Constants
tldr: The author investigates the relationship between the refraction of elements and their chemical equivalents. They analyze the specific and atomic refractions of various elements and propose a new formula, the "Refractive Constant of Equivalent Weights," which connects optical properties with chemical properties, similar to Faraday's law of electro-chemical equivalents.
