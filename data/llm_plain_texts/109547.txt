tldr: The author, Richard Chenevix, examines the properties and reactions of oxygenated and hyperoxygenized muriatic acid, as well as their combinations with various salts. He analyzes the proportions of oxygen and acid in these compounds and discusses their reactions with other substances, such as ammonia and phosphoric acid. Chenevix also explores the formation of new salts and the potential applications of hyperoxygenized muriatic acid.
