tldr: The author, Humphry Davy, conducted experiments on phosphorus and sulphur, discovering new compounds and providing evidence for the idea that bodies unite in definite proportions. He found that phosphorus and chlorine form two distinct compounds, and that phosphorus can dissolve in water to form hydrophosphorous acid. Additionally, Davy explored the properties of a peculiar gas produced by the reaction of phosphorus and chlorine, which he called hydrophosphoric gas. These findings contribute to the understanding of chemical reactions and the composition of various compounds.
