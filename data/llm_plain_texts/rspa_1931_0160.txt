tldr: The authors studied the absorption spectra of alkyl halides, focusing on the energies of the C-I and C-Br bonds. They found that the absorption spectra of these compounds are continuous, and the energy of the bonds can be calculated from the heats of combustion. The authors also observed that the absorption limits shift towards the red when the alkyl halides are liquefied, and discussed the possible effects of molecular association on the energy of the bonds.
