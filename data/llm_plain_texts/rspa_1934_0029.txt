tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the anomalous absorption and emission of high energy gamma radiation. They found that the secondary emission is mainly a gamma radiation and that the fraction of the incident gamma-ray energy re-emitted by each nucleus is approximately 0.53. The results indicate that the process of interaction is one involving the degradation of radiation, with four to six low-energy quanta emitted for each high-energy quantum absorbed. The authors also discuss the isotropic distribution of the secondary radiation and its implications.
