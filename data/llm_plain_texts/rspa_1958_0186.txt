tldr: The authors used X-ray diffraction and the isomorphous replacement method to determine the phase angles in the non-centrosymmetric [100] zone of horse haemoglobin. They successfully applied new methods for finding heavy atom vectors and combined them with anomalous scattering by mercury atoms to determine the phases of most reflexions out to a spacing of about 6 Å with a standard error of about 0.2. The resulting electron density projection provides promising prospects for three-dimensional structure analysis at 6 Å resolution, revealing the internal organization of the haemoglobin molecule.
