tldr: Dr. James Parsons examines the shells of crabs and their regeneration process. He explains that crabs shed their shells to grow and protect themselves. The new shell forms under the old one and is similar to the membrane of a hen's egg before hardening. This process is also observed in other animals like snakes and lizards. The author provides insights into the induration of the surfaces of shells and how they are formed by solid particles carried by the animal's fluids to the membrane.
