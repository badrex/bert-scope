tldr: The article discusses the discovery of noble gases in meteorites, specifically the presence of presolar matter and superheavy elements. The researchers found that meteorites contain trapped noble gas components with different isotopic compositions, host phases, and release temperatures. Some of these components, such as Ne-E, require nuclear processes and may be of presolar origin. The study of these components and their host phases can provide evidence for their true nature and help understand the early Solar System.
