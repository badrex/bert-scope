tldr: The authors, D. H. Hubel and T. N. Wiesel, studied the functional architecture of the macaque monkey visual cortex. They discovered that cells with similar physiological properties, such as orientation specificity and ocular dominance, are grouped together in vertically organized columns. This organization helps in understanding how the visual cortex processes and interprets visual information.
