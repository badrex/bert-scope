tldr: The author presents a case study of a patient with an extraordinary cyst in the liver filled with water. The cyst was found to be the result of a single conglobated gland that had burst. The liver was enlarged and pressing on the stomach and spleen, causing the patient discomfort. The patient's other symptoms included a lack of thirst and difficulty bearing any posture other than leaning forward on their chest. The left kidney was also examined and found to have two ureters with separate pelvises.
