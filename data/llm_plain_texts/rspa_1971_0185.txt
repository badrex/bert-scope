tldr: The authors conducted a photoionization study of mercury using photoelectron spectroscopy in the wavelength region of 70 to 90 nm. They determined relative cross-sections for producing mercury ions in specific energy states and found that autoionized states above the 2 * * *D| limit decay to the 2Sj and 2 *D j states of the ion with approximately equal probability.
