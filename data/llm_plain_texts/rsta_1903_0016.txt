tldr: The author studied the formation of clear and definite figures created by the deposition of dust on heated plates. They discovered that the shape of the plate determines the figure formed, and the temperature plays a crucial role in the figure's clarity and density. The author also found that the figures are sensitive to changes in temperature and can be influenced by external heat sources.
