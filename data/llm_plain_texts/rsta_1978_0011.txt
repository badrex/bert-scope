tldr: This article discusses the nature and formation of textures in polycrystalline materials, focusing on the deformation and recrystallization processes in metals and quartz. The author outlines the genesis of textures during plastic deformation and the influence of pre-existing texture on subsequent deformation and creep. The article also analyzes the textures formed by annealing after plastic deformation and assesses the roles of oriented nucleation and oriented growth. Lastly, the author explains the formation of textures in stressed polycrystalline quartz due to Dauphine twinning and compares the driving forces behind this phenomenon with those responsible for recrystallization in metals.
