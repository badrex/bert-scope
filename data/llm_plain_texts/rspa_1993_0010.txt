tldr: The authors derived rigorous bounds on the complex bulk modulus of isotropic viscoelastic two-phase composites using a new variational principle and two established techniques, the translation method and the Hashin-Shtrikman method. These bounds provide a benchmark for testing experimental results, approximation theories, and can help identify optimal structures for use in design. The effective bulk modulus is constrained to a lens-shaped region in the complex plane, and the bounds are similar to those obtained for the complex dielectric constant but with different methods.
