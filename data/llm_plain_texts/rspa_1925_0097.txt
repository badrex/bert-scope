tldr: 'The authors studied the secondary spectrum of hydrogen at higher pressures using an arc between tungsten electrodes in an atmosphere of hydrogen. They found that the intensities of the lines differed from previous findings, and the formula of Kramers and Pauli failed for the lowest quantum numbers. The results suggest that there might be a factor not accounted for in the current theory. The authors also discovered a striking similarity between their findings and those of Richardson and Tanaka, indicating a possible connection between the two sets of data.'
