tldr: This article explores parametric modeling for the velocity and velocity derivative fields in stationary turbulence. The authors propose a process that is the sum of two independent autoregressions, which achieves a good fit locally and at longer ranges. They also consider a model derived from autor regressions with dependence structures on the borderline of long-range dependence. The study suggests further empirical and theoretical work in the field of turbulence modeling.
