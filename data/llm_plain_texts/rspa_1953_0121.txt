tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the motions of slow electrons in air and their impact on the ionosphere. They found empirical formulae to determine the drift velocity, collisional frequency, electronic temperature, and mean energy loss per collision. These results allowed them to calculate electronic collisional frequencies in the ionosphere below 94 km, providing more accurate values than previous suggestions. The study also explored the dependence of the collisional cross-sections of air molecules on the speed of electrons and the relationship between the Townsend energy factor and the mean power supplied to an electron.
