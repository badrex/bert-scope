tldr: This study examines the Pleistocene deposits in a 100 km2 area of south Leicestershire, mapping their lithology and stratigraphy. The research confirms the extension of the Baginton-Lillington sand and gravel along the proto-Soar valley and identifies an early ice advance that deposited the Thrussington till. The study also discusses the post-depositional disruptions, including glaciotectonic disturbances and subglacial furrows, that affected the area.
