tldr: The study examines how toads navigate and perceive their environment, specifically their ability to display size constancy. Toads were observed as they approached mealworms through obstacles, such as picket fences. The results showed that toads have both depth and size constancy, allowing them to plan their routes accurately based on the real size and distance of objects in their surroundings.
