tldr: The authors present a series-based method to calculate the probability density of the spacing between zeros in a stationary, random function. This method provides more accurate results, especially near the origin, and offers a comparison with other previously proposed approximations. The study has applications in noise analysis in electrical circuits and sea wave analysis.
