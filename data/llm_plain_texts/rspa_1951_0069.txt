tldr: The authors conducted an experimental study to measure the viscosity of liquids at constant volume and temperature. They used a high-pressure vessel and a modified viscometer to determine the relationship between viscosity, temperature, and density. Preliminary measurements were reported on benzene and carbon tetrachloride, confirming the predicted relation between viscosity and temperature at constant volume in existing viscosity theories. This research provided a direct determination of the variation of viscosity with temperature at constant volume, which was previously unexplored.
