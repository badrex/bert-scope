semantic_tags:
  - Enzyme activity
  - Alkaline phosphatase

  - Calcium phosphate deposition
tldr: The authors developed a quantitative cytochemical method to measure alkaline phosphatase activity in cells using interference microscopy. They studied the effect of substrate concentration, temperature, and calcium-ion concentration on enzymatic activity in rat-kidney tubules and duodenal epithelium. This method provides a new approach to studying enzyme activity at cellular sites and can be used to estimate the mass of calcium phosphate deposited during enzyme action.
