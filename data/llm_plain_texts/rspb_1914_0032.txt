tldr: 'The author investigates the growth of adult mammalian tissue in autogenous and homogenous plasma, finding that testicle tissue grows better in homogenous plasma that has been kept frozen for three days. However, no growth occurs in plasma that has been frozen for more than six to eight days. The study also shows that testicle tissue grows better in homogenous plasma than in autogenous plasma.'
