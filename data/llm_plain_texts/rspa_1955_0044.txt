tldr: The authors conducted experiments on ultra-violet dichroism in organic compounds, specifically focusing on the peptide group and substituted phenyl groups. They developed a theoretical framework to interpret dichroism measurements and applied it to the ultra-violet spectra of polypeptides and proteins. The results provided insights into the direction of molecular transition moments, which is essential for understanding the structure and properties of these compounds.
