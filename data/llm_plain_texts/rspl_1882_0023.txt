tldr: The authors developed a new method to study the electric arc and vapour radiation using a hollow carbon tube. This method allowed them to control the temperature and observe the reversal of spectral lines from various elements. They found that the calcium lines H and K behaved peculiarly, and the lithium lines at 4603 and 4131 were relatively difficult to reverse. The method showed promise for solving complex spectroscopic problems and provided valuable insights into the spectra of iron, copper, and other elements.
