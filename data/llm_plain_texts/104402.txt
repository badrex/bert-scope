tldr: The author, Ephraim Rinhold Seehl, presents an improved method for obtaining the volatile acid of sulphur using alkali salt and quick-lime. The process involves dissolving the sulphur and salt, followed by distillation to separate the volatile spirit of sulphur. This new method provides a more powerful and efficient way to obtain the acid, with potential applications in medicine and metallurgy.
