tldr: This article discusses the genesis and formation mechanisms of pleochroic haloes, focusing on the differences between active and extinct haloes. The author proposes a hydrothermal genesis for extinct haloes, where radioactive elements from a hydrothermal solution continuously deposit and disintegrate in the halo nucleus, leading to the formation of characteristic ring structures. The study provides insights into the physical and geochemical processes involved in halo formation and sheds light on the role of radioactive equilibrium in the development of these structures.
