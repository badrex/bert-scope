tldr: The author investigates the interaction of various gases with clean evaporated metal films, focusing on the chemisorption properties of twenty different metals. The study reveals that oxygen chemisorption is universal among most metals, while nitrogen and hydrogen chemisorption is limited to transition metals and alkaline earth metals. The findings contribute to the understanding of surface properties and the d-band theory of metal catalysts.
