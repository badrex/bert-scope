tldr: In 1905, a team of astronomers, led by H. H. Turner, traveled to Aswan, Egypt, to observe the total solar eclipse. They used various instruments, including a large 2-foot mirror and Goerz lenses, to capture images and data during the event. The expedition's findings contributed to the understanding of the solar corona and the potential of large telescopes in astronomical research.
