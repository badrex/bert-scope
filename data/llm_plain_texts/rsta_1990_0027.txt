tldr: This article explores the relationship between solar activity and climate variability using 10Be and stable isotope ratios in polar ice cores. The authors compare two Antarctic ice cores, one from the South Pole and the other from Dome C, covering the past 1000 and 3000 years, respectively. They find no significant correlation between solar activity and climate in these ice cores, suggesting that other factors may play a more significant role in climate change.
