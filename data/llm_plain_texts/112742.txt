tldr: The author investigates the mathematical properties of stream-lines with four foci, also known as quadrifocal or cycno'ds, which resemble the water-lines of bird-like models. These stream-lines are important in naval architecture, as they help in designing ships with smooth water flow and reduced resistance. The author also discusses the resistance caused by disturbances in the water and the role of experiments in advancing knowledge of ship resistance.
