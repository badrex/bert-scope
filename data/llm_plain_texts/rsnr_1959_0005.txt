tldr: 'The article discusses the life and work of Thomas Robert Malthus, an influential economist and member of the Royal Society. Malthus is best known for his theory on population growth, which states that population tends to increase faster than the means of subsistence. This theory had a significant impact on economic and social thought, and Malthus' ideas continue to be relevant in contemporary discussions on population and economic development.'
