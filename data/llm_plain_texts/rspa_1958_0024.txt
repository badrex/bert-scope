tldr: The authors determined the thickness, dielectric constant, and other properties of anodic oxide films on tantalum by analyzing the interference colors and using spectrophotometric measurements. They found a method to calculate the thickness from the interference maxima and obtained the refractive index at different wavelengths. This research helps in understanding the formation process of anodic oxide films on tantalum.
