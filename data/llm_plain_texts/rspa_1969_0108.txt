tldr: The article discusses the use of perturbed angular correlations with hyperfine interactions in nuclear applications, specifically focusing on ion implantation and the effects of hyperfine interactions on radioactive sources embedded in ferromagnetic materials using an isotope separator. The three main topics covered are the magnetization of the foil, magnetic time-dependent interactions from paramagnetic spin relaxation, and experiments involving electron cascades.
