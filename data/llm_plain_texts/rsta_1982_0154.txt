tldr: The article investigates the use of heteronuclear platinum clusters as catalysts for the hydrogenation of carbon-carbon multiple bonds. The clusters Pt2Co2(CO)8(PPh3)2 and Pt(C6HnNC)2[Mo(CO)3(n*-C5H5)]2 show reasonable activity for the hydrogenation of terminal acetylenes but are poor catalysts for olefin hydrogenation. The PtMo2 cluster can be recovered unaltered, while the Pt2Co2 cluster undergoes complex molecular rearrangements under catalytic conditions. The article concludes that new species formed by the interaction between the original clusters and terminal acetylenes are the active hydrogenation catalysts.
