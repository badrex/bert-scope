tldr: Dr. Edward Tyson observed an infant with the brain depressed into the hollow of the vertebrae of the neck. The child appeared healthy but had no forehead and a significantly reduced brain size. Tyson speculated that the brain's functions could be maintained by the spinal cord's medullary substance, especially in embryos where there is no sensory or imaginative activity. This observation raises questions about similar cases of infants born without brains and the role of brain injury in such cases.
