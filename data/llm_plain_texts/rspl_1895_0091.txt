revised_title: Spinal-Root Connections and Ganglion-Cell Connections of Nerve-Fibres Affecting Spleen Contraction
semantic_tags:
  - Autonomic nervous system
  - Spleen contraction
  - Nerve roots
  - Sympathetic nervous system
  - Nicotine effects
tldr: The authors investigated the effects of stimulating spinal nerve roots on spleen volume in four dogs. They found that nerve-fibres producing spleen contraction have a cell station in the prevertebral ganglia. The study also showed that nicotine can temporarily or completely block the effects of stimulating the nerve-roots and splanchnics, suggesting a cell station in the semilunar ganglion.
