tldr: This study examines genetic variation and selection in house mouse populations from various locations, including the Faroe, Shetland, and Orkney archipelagoes, the mainland of Great Britain, and a sub-Antarctic island. The researchers found no discernible pattern in allele frequencies, but identified three loci that underwent seasonal changes due to selection. They suggest that non-constant selection pressures and chance historical factors influence genetic variation in these populations.
