revised_title: The Propagation and Characteristics of Atmospheric Waves
semantic_tags:
  - Atmospheric Waves
  - Wave Propagation
  - Atmospheric Oscillations
  - Atmospheric Physics
  - Earth's Rotation
tldr: The authors study the propagation of a pulse in the atmosphere, focusing on the effects of temperature distribution and the role of the earth's rotation. They analyze the relative amplitudes of different modes of atmospheric waves and discuss the implications of their findings for understanding the behavior of atmospheric disturbances like volcanic eruptions.
