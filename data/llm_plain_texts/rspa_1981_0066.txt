tldr: The author presents an iterative method to solve a nonlinear differential equation describing the convergence to equilibrium in a system of reacting polymers. The method provides a global solution, proving its existence, uniqueness, and continuity with respect to initial data. This constructive approach offers a wide applicability to various nonlinear initial value problems.
