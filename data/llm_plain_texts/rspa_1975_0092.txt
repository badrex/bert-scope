tldr: The article discusses the behavior of a fluid rotating as if rigid with angular velocity when subject to a small forced oscillation. The author examines the validity of an inviscid solution and the structure of viscous shear layers in the fluid. The study considers a problem in which the full viscous equations are tractable, extending Stewartson's split-disk configuration to oscillatory disturbances. The results show that the inviscid solution contains singularities, and the decay of the fluid variables away from them is only algebraic.
