tldr: This article discusses the ecological effects of deposited sulfur and nitrogen compounds, focusing on their impact on plants, soil, and freshwater ecosystems. The authors evaluate scientific understanding of these effects and highlight the importance of considering various factors, such as atmospheric processes, deposition mechanisms, and interactions between pollutants. They also emphasize the need for further research to develop adequate models and establish rates of change in these ecosystems.
