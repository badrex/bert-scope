tldr: The authors studied the emission bands of cathodo-luminescence in various fluorescent materials, focusing on sulphide phosphors. They determined the shape, position, and intensity of the bands using a microphotometer and calculated the band's mathematical form. The study provides insights into the properties of emission bands and their potential applications in technical practices.
