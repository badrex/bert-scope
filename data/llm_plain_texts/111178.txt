tldr: W.R. Grove's experiments demonstrated that gases can have electrochemical polarity, affecting the oxidation and reduction of metals. He used a unique apparatus to create a powerful secondary current, allowing him to observe the effects of different gases and mixtures on the polarity of metals. Grove's findings support his theory that the discharges create a chemical polarity in the intervening gas, similar to electrolytes, which influences the reactions that occur.
