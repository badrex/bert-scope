revised_title: 'Energy States of Proteins, Enzymes, and Membranes: A Review'
semantic_tags:
  - Protein conformation
  - Enzyme catalysis
  - Membrane energization
  - Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy
  - Energy transduction
tldr: This review lecture discusses the energy states of proteins, enzymes, and membranes, focusing on their configurational, electronic, and vibrational/rotational states. The author explores the use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to study protein conformation and energy states, and how these energy states are utilized in enzymic catalysis and energy conversion within membranes. The lecture also touches upon the cooperative energy modes in proteins and their potential role in energy transduction.
