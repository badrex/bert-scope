tldr: The study investigates the rod opsin gene of the sand goby (Pomatoschistus minutus) and compares its amino acid sequence with those of other vertebrates. The sand goby's rod visual pigment has a maximum absorbance of approximately 501 nm. The research provides insights into the conservation of the opsin gene and its significance for the function of visual pigments with specific sensitivities.
