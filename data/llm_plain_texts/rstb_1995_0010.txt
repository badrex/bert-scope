tldr: This article discusses nucleotide excision repair (NER) in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its relationship to specialized mitotic recombination and RNA polymerase II basal transcription. The authors describe the roles of various genes and their products in NER, including the Radi/Rad10 endonuclease complex, and how these genes are involved in other aspects of DNA metabolism and transcription.
