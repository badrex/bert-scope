tldr: This study examines the pharmacological effects of pyraconitine and methylbenzaconine, two derivatives of aconitine. The authors find that removing the acetyl group from aconitine significantly reduces its toxicity and changes its physiological effects. Pyraconitine and methylbenzaconine have different actions on the heart and nervous system, with pyraconitine being more toxic and having a stronger effect on motor nerves. The study supports the idea that introducing a methyl group into the molecule of certain alkaloids can cause a curare-like action at the periphery.
