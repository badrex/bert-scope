tldr: The authors discuss the problem of nonlinear instability in difference schemes for solving nonlinear hyperbolic equations. They focus on the Lax-Wendroff scheme and the natural explicit scheme, showing that adding pseudo-viscosity terms can lead to stability and convergence. The study of these methods can help in the numerical approximation of solutions to nonlinear hyperbolic equations.
