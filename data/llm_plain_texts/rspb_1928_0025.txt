tldr: Researchers conducted gonad cross-transplantation experiments in domestic fowl to study the relationship between gonadic structure and plumage characteristics. The results showed that testicular secretions influence the growth of head furnishings and sex instincts, while plumage is determined by genetic factors. This study provides insights into the complex interplay between reproductive organs and plumage development in domestic fowl.
