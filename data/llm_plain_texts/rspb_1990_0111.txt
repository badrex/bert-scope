tldr: This study examines the pattern of resource allocation in four populations of the yellow monkey flower, Mimulus guttatus. The research measures the allocation of biomass to female, male, and attractive structures and finds that the investment in primary female structures exceeds investment in anthers, and the mass of seeds is greater still. The mass of the corolla is a good predictor of ovary and capsule mass, and it is argued that the cumulative corolla mass can be used as an indirect measure of parental investment. By including attractive structures as part of the male function of a plant, the sex ratio of this species is between 34 and 42%.
