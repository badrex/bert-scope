tldr: The author presents a study of hourly temperature and pressure observations at British observatories using harmonic analysis. The study aims to understand the diurnal variations of temperature and pressure and their relation to the position of the Sun. The author discusses the methods and results of the analysis, including the calculation of harmonic constants and the impact of periodic and non-periodic variations on the data.
