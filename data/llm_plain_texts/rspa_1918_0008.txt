tldr: The author describes a new gyroscopic phenomenon where a spinning gyroscope with an unbalanced flywheel rises up a vertical rod when given a slight horizontal push. The experiment involves a wooden frame, a vertical rod, and a flywheel attached to a spindle. The phenomenon occurs due to the centrifugal couples arising from the unbalanced flywheel and the oscillatory motion of the vertical stem and gyroscope. This discovery has implications for understanding gyroscopic behavior and potential applications in engineering.
