tldr: The author conducted experiments on the flexion and decomposition of light, discovering that the bending of light rays is in proportion to the breadth of the colored fringes formed after passing by a bending body. The fringes are real images of the light source and can be observed using simple apparatus. The author also refutes the notion that the breadths of fringes in different colored lights explain the colors of fringes in white light.
