tldr: The study compares the number of plasmalemmal vesicles in arterial and venous endothelial cells of rats. It finds that arterial endothelial cells contain about twice as many vesicles as venous cells, suggesting that differences in vesicle numbers do not contribute significantly to the selective accumulation of atherogenic plasma proteins in arteries. The research also indicates that localized accumulations of atherogenic plasma proteins may result from small, continuous excesses of influx over elimination.
