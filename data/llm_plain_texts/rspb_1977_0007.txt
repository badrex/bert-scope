tldr: 'Computed tomography is a new X-ray technique that allows for the visualization of different soft tissues and organs in transverse sections, providing a more accurate diagnosis. This technique reduces the need for painful, risky, and time-consuming examinations, and offers the possibility of using opacifying media to enhance the visibility of certain organs or tissues. Computed tomography also enables function tests of various organs and offers higher precision in radiation therapy planning. This revolutionary technique has the potential to change the field of diagnostic radiology and provide new insights into various disorders and diseases.'
