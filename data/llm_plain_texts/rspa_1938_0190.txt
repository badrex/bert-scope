tldr: This article investigates the specific heat of brass and proposes a new approach to understanding the anomalous rise in specific heat observed in previous experiments. The authors modify existing theories to account for volume changes and apply Kirkwood's first approximation to a finite lattice with interaction energies depending on volume. This new approach removes the discontinuity in specific heat and provides a better understanding of the order-disorder transition in brass.
