tldr: In 1699, William Cowper discovered two previously unnoticed glands and their excretory ducts in the human body. These glands, located near the prostate, play a role in the male reproductive system and help in the process of generation. The author explains the function and structure of these glands and their ducts, as well as their role in preventing the mixing of urine and semen during erection. Cowper also compares the glands' structure and function in different animals, highlighting the unique adaptations in each species.
