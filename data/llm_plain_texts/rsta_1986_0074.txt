tldr: This article reviews the methods available for studying surfaces on a microscopic scale, focusing on the use of finely focused scanned electron beams. It discusses various techniques, including Auger and secondary electron spectroscopy and microscopy, and electron diffraction. The authors provide examples of their own work on Ag layers on bulk single-crystal Si, but also discuss applications to other materials and thin films. The article highlights the potential of scanning electron microscopy in providing high-resolution images of surface features and reactions.
