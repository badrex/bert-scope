tldr: The authors studied the light organ of Anomalops, a type of fish, and discovered two distinct reflectors that help increase light emission. The internal reflector is a thick, chalky white layer that reflects about 70% of the visible light spectrum. The external reflector is a specular reflector that directs light outwards and upwards. These reflectors work together to enhance the fish's luminescence, which is used for communication and attracting prey.
