tldr: The authors present a mathematical model for the interstitialcy diffusion mechanism in semiconductors. They formulate a system of differential-difference equations and derive a continuum model to describe the diffusion process. The model considers the interaction of impurity atoms and empty interstitial sites in a semiconductor crystal, providing insights into the diffusion process and its implications for the electrical properties of semiconductors.
