tldr: This study examines the nature of exsolution lamellae in an extremely slowly cooled clinopyroxene (augite) using high-resolution electron microscopy. The research identifies three sets of lamellae, which probably formed mainly during the cooling process, as amphibole, pigeonite, and hypersthene. The findings help establish the relation between the phases and the cooling history of the rock, providing insights into the nucleation processes in crystalline materials.
