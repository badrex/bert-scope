tldr: This article explores the use of vertical process water column models to understand the interactions between physical transport and reaction processes in the North Sea. The models can simulate annual cycles of sea surface temperature and mixed layer thickness, providing insights into the effects of coupled processes on the ecosystem. The study highlights the importance of considering physical, chemical, and biological processes in understanding the dynamics of the North Sea's plankton community.
