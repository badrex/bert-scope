tldr: The author conducted breeding experiments with the rotifer Hydatina to study sex determination. They found that neither temperature nor nutrition played a significant role in the varying proportion of arrenotokous and thelytokous offspring. Instead, the author suggests that it may be the property of certain individuals to produce a specific ratio of offspring, and that external factors do not influence sex determination in this species.
