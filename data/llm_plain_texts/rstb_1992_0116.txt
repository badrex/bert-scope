revised_title: Asymptotic Distributions of Apparent Open and Shut Times in Single Channel Recordings

  - Missed Event Problem
  - Open and Shut Time Distributions
tldr: The authors present a method for analyzing single channel recordings, accounting for the omission of brief events due to the limitations of the recording apparatus. They introduce the concept of extended opening and shut times, which can be used to approximate the observed open and shut times. The study provides a more accurate representation of the underlying ion channel behavior, allowing for better understanding and analysis of the data.
