tldr: The authors develop a method to express the potential energy of a polyatomic molecule as the sum of potential energies of groups of atoms within the molecule. They consider the symmetry of the molecule and determine energy constants for different types of chemical bonds. This work provides insight into the potential energy functions and chemical types of polyatomic molecules.
