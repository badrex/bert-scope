tldr: This study investigates the effects of acetylcholine on mammalian cardiac activity, specifically the'slow inward current' in cardiac muscle. The authors find that acetylcholine blocks calcium current permeability, which is crucial for modulating moderate chronotropic changes and may also play a role in complete vagal inhibition. The research uses a computer model to simulate the effects of acetylcholine on cardiac electrophysiology and provides insights into the complex interactions between different ion currents in the heart.
