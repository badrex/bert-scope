tldr: The author conducted experiments with various ammonium salts to study their effects on muscle and nerve. They found that ammoniacal salts, such as chloride, bromide, and iodide, have different actions on the spinal cord and motor nerves. Ammonia and ammonium chloride produce tetanus, while bromide causes hypereesthesia and late tetanus. Iodide leads to rapid failure of higher reflexes and progressive paralysis without tetanus. These findings provide insights into the complex interactions between ammonium salts and the nervous system.
