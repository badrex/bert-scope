tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the reversible oxidation of chlorophyll, a key component in photosynthesis. They discovered that chlorophyll reacts with certain oxidizing agents, such as ferric salts, forming a yellow product that can be regained by the action of ferrous salts. This process confirms the oxidation theory of chlorophyll's reaction with ferric salts and demonstrates chlorophyll's ability to act as an oxidation-reduction catalyst in the dark. The study also explores the influence of salts on the equilibrium and the effects of light on the reaction.
