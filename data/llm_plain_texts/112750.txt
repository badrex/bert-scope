tldr: The author observed the spectra of stars and nebulae using a spectroscope, particularly focusing on the Orion Nebula and the spectrum of Jupiter. They discovered bright lines in the spectrum of the star rj Argo and found that the spectra of the Orion Nebula and the surrounding area were similar to the bright surrounding nebula. They also observed the Fraunhofer lines in Jupiter's spectrum, including the telluric lines 914 and 838. These observations provided evidence of changes in the Orion Nebula and confirmed previous findings by Huggins.
