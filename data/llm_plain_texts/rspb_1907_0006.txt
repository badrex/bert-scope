tldr: This article discusses the transpiration current in plants and challenges previous methods and calculations for determining the forces required to move water through plants. The author argues that previous methods overestimated the resistance to flow in stems and the velocity of the transpiration current. The article also highlights the importance of considering the varying conditions and supply of water in different parts of a plant.
