tldr: The article discusses the manipulation of genetic systems in plant breeding through intraspecific chromosome manipulation. It focuses on the use of aneuploids, particularly in hexaploid bread wheat, to study quantitative characters and identify chromosomes responsible for varietal differences. The author also introduces a method called reciprocal monosomics, which allows for the identification of significant chromosomal effects in one to two generations, speeding up the process of developing substitution lines. This method has applications in plant breeding and increasing the understanding of the genetic architecture of wheat.
