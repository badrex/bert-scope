tldr: This article presents a model of sympatric speciation through sexual selection in small populations. The model suggests that a single mutation in a female mate-preference rule can lead to the rapid evolution of fully reproductively isolated species, even in the absence of disruptive natural selection or linkage between male traits and female preferences. The study also demonstrates the potential role of sexual selection in contributing to differences in speciation rates among lineages.
