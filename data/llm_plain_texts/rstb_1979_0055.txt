tldr: The study compares the cerebellum, deep cerebellar nuclei, and inferior olivary nucleus of normal and Lurcher mutant mice using light and electron microscopy. The Lurcher mutant mouse has a smaller cerebellum, no Purkinje cells, and reduced granule cells. The study provides insights into the development of these structural changes and the primary lesion in the Lurcher mutant.
