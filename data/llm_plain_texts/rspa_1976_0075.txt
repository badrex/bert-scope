tldr: The article explores the properties of shear-free congruences of null geodesics and their relation to algebraically special vacuum space-times. It introduces an integrability condition that leads to a basis-free proof of the Goldberg-Sachs theorem and related results. The study focuses on the vacuum field equations for algebraically special space-times and the existence of a shear-free geodetic null congruence in these space-times.
