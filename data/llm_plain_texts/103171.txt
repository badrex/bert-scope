tldr: The author, Francis Hauksbee, conducted an experiment to study the ascent of water between two glass planes in a hyperbolick figure. He found that the water rose at different angles and distances, demonstrating the power of attraction and the effect of surface tension. The experiment was initially made by Mr. Brook Taylor, but Hauksbee's apparatus allowed for more accurate measurements.
