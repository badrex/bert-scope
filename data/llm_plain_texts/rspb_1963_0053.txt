tldr: The authors discovered that barnacle cyprids respond to adsorbed layers of a protein called arthropodin on surfaces, which helps them recognize and settle on suitable surfaces. This research sheds light on the instinctive behavior of barnacles and the role of a "tactile chemical sense" in their settlement process.
