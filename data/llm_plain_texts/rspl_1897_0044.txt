tldr: The author investigates the sensitivity of the retina to light and color, discovering that the smallest diameter of a spot of illuminated surface governs the necessary reduction in light intensity to produce no sensation of light. The author also finds that all color fields have the same form, with the extent depending solely on the illumination and the area of the surface. This research challenges the accepted theories of color vision and suggests a modification that may explain the connection between light and color.
