tldr: This article discusses the limitations of Dulong and Petit's law of cooling and presents a new analysis of temperature distribution in cooling objects. The authors use Fourier's formula to calculate the temperature distribution in a cooling copper globe and compare it to previous experiments. They also explore the insulation resistance of glass in temperature measurement devices.
