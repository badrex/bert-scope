tldr: This article discusses the influence of mean flow on the acoustic properties of a tube bank, focusing on the interaction between sound waves and the mean flow. The authors provide a detailed diffraction analysis for the case of a bank of strips set at zero angle of attack to the mean flow. They derive various approximations for the dispersion equation governing the propagation of long waves, taking into account the influence of acoustically induced vortex shedding from the strip trailing edges and hydrodynamic interactions between neighboring strips. The sound is attenuated by transferring energy to the kinetic energy of the shed vorticity. The authors also discuss the relevance of these results to bound resonances in tube bank cavities.
