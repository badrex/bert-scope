tldr: This study focuses on the Senegalese Grasshopper, Oedaleus senegalensis, which is a major crop pest in the Sahel region. The author developed an ecological model to understand the grasshopper's interactions with its environment, including factors such as photoperiod, thermal conditions, moisture, and vegetation. The model helps identify essential elements in the grasshopper's life cycle, factors involved in mass multiplication, and gregarization, and provides insights for an effective and economic system of surveillance and control.
