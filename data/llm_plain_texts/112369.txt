tldr: The author examines the phenomena of light, heat, and sound accompanying meteorite falls, proposing a theory for the nature and succession of events that occur during their existence. They argue that meteorites enter the Earth's atmosphere as single or agglomerated fragments, generating light and heat as they progress through the air. The cosmic course ends when the fragment is arrested by air resistance, and the meteorite falls to the ground like a heavy object. The author's theory is supported by recent publications and observations of meteorite falls.
