tldr: Researchers investigated the impact of a scorbutic diet on the teeth of guinea-pigs and found that even mild scurvy caused significant changes in the structure of the teeth. The study also showed that the teeth were one of the first parts of the body to be affected by a deficiency of antiscorbutic materials in the diet. This research helped to further understand the pathological anatomy of scurvy and its effects on the body.
