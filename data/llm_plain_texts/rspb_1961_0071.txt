tldr: 'This study examines the association between the hermit crab Dardanus arrosor and the sea anemone Calliactis parasitica. The authors found that crabs can display an active behavior pattern to help transfer the anemone to their shell. However, they also discovered that crabs tend to fall into two groups: "performers" that show this behavior almost without fail and "non-performers" that almost never show this activity. Most "performers" were females, while most "non-performers" were males. The authors also found that for successful crab-aided transfers, the cooperation of the anemone is necessary, depending on a response of the tentacles to the shell.'
