tldr: G.G. Stokes investigates the communication of vibration from a vibrating body to surrounding gases, focusing on the role of sound wave propagation and the velocity of sound in different gases. He provides mathematical solutions for specific cases, such as a vibrating sphere and an infinite cylinder, and explains the implications for musical instruments and the experiments of John Leslie.
