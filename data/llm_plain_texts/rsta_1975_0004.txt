tldr: This article discusses the origin and distribution of cosmic radiation, specifically primary -rays, within our galaxy. The authors explore the interactions between cosmic rays and interstellar matter, leading to high-energy -rays, and how this radiation can provide information on the distribution of cosmic rays in the galaxy. They also examine the potential for gamma-ray astronomy to reveal insights into cosmology and the presence of ancient cosmic rays in the universe.
