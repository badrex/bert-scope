tldr: This study examines the phytogeography and climate of the Early Mesozoic era by analyzing floral data from Eurasia. The research reveals a latitudinal gradient for each epoch, which can be interpreted climatically as ranging from dry subtropical to warm and cool temperate biomes. The findings suggest climate stasis over a long interval, with local climate changes appearing to be the result of continental motion rather than global change.
