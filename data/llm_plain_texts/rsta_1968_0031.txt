tldr: This article discusses the phenomenon of Earth's magnetic field reversals and their potential causes. The author examines the evidence from magnetized rocks and the distribution of normal and reversed magnetization in different geological periods. The study suggests that Earth's magnetic field reversals are likely due to changes in the Earth's core and may have implications for paleoclimatology and continental drift.
