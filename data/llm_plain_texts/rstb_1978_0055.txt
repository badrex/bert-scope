tldr: This article discusses the nature and significance of microatolls, which are coral colonies with dead, flat tops and living perimeters, found in the Northern Great Barrier Reef. Microatolls are formed due to a restriction of upward growth by the air/water interface. The study reveals that microatolls on reef flats can grow up to 1.1 meters higher than open-water microatolls, which affects their use in establishing sea level history. The research also highlights the factors controlling pond height during one sea stand, such as tidal range and wave energy, and provides insights into the coral species that develop microatoll forms.
