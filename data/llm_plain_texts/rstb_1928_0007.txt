tldr: The author examines the structure of a unique band of bright coal called the "cortex band" found in the Deep Soft seam. Using metallographic methods, they identify the complex periderm structure of certain Lycopodiales plants in the coal, which is different from the secondary xylem and medullary ray tissue. This discovery helps in understanding the preservation of plant structures in coal and the identification of different plant tissues.
