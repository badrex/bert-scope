tldr: This study investigates the mechanical properties and ecological significance of the coral Acropora reticulata. The coral's skeletal structure is found to be linearly elastic and brittle, with strength varying depending on the anatomic direction. The shape and size of the coral colonies determine the hydrodynamic forces and moments that stress and break the colony skeletons. The mechanically functional organization of the skeleton affects the distribution, abundance, and life-historical characteristics of Acropora reticulata.
