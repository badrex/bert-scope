tldr: This article investigates the ultra-violet radiation emitted during carbonic oxide-oxygen (or air) explosions at high pressures. The authors designed a specialized explosion chamber with quartz windows to perform spectrographic analysis of the explosions. They found that nitrogen absorbs part of the radiation emitted by burning carbonic oxide, which activates the nitrogen and allows it to combine with excess oxygen, forming nitric oxide. This research provides insight into the role of radiation in gaseous explosions and the chemical changes that occur during these events.
