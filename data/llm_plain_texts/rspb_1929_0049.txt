tldr: The study investigates the role of colored globules in the retina of domestic hens in color perception. The researchers found that red globules transmit light from the red end of the spectrum up to the yellow sodium lines, yellow globules transmit red, yellow, and green, and pale green globules transmit almost the entire visible spectrum. These findings contribute to understanding how birds perceive colors.
