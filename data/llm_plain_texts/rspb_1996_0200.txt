tldr: The authors propose a new index of ageing, called'reproductive value', which takes into account both survival and reproduction prospects. They argue that using this measure can help resolve some apparent anomalies in the rate of ageing and its relation to evolutionary theories. Ageing can evolve through life history optimization or mutation accumulation, and it is not necessarily dependent on antagonistic pleiotropy. The authors emphasize that ageing is a part of the life history optimization process and can occur even when mutations affect only one age class or show synergistic pleiotropy.
