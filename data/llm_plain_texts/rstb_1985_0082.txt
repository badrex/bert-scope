tldr: The article discusses the evolution and environment of Myriapoda during the late Silurian and early Devonian periods. It examines the fossil record of these ancient arthropods, focusing on the Diplopoda (millepedes), and provides insights into their classification, morphology, and possible habitats. The findings contribute to our understanding of the early history of land-dwelling arthropods and their diversification.
