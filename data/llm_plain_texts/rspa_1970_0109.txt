tldr: The authors discovered oscillations in the Hall effect of tin due to magnetic breakdown. They explained these oscillations by considering the migration of electrons through magnetic breakdown and the effect of rare collisions on the electrons. The theory they developed, which involves the diffusion of electrons on a limited orbit-network, accurately predicts the angular variation of oscillatory amplitude.
