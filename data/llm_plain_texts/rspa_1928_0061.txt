tldr: This article presents an analytical solution for the bending of centrally-loaded isotropic rectangular plates supported at two opposite edges. The author derives the deflection equation using complex variable transformations and Fourier series, providing a comprehensive understanding of the plate's behavior under load. This work has implications for determining elastic constants in materials and designing structures with optimal support.
