tldr: This article investigates the decay of axisymmetric turbulence and provides explicit solutions for the final period of decay. It shows that a state of turbulence exists as a superposition of two non-interacting fields, which are isotropic and axisymmetric, respectively. The study also reveals the asymptotic behavior of the solutions for the scalars defining the turbulence, which is in agreement with Batchelor's general results on the role of big eddies in homogeneous turbulence.
