tldr: The authors study pulse solutions of the wave equation and their radiation fields. They prove a unique continuation property, which states that if a radiation field is given for all directions in an open set of the unit sphere, then the pulse solution of the wave equation vanishes. They also derive an integral representation of the Laplace transform of the radiation field in terms of a contour integral over the complex unit sphere.
