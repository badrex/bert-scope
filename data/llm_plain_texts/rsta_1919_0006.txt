tldr: 'This article discusses the investigation of the ultra-violet band of ammonia and its presence in the solar spectrum. The authors conducted experiments using spectrographs of high resolving power to compare the ammonia band with the solar spectrum, finding that the ammonia band accounts for many faint lines with no other suggested origins. They also analyzed the structure of the band, discovering groups of three lines and discussing the effects of different experimental conditions on the band's appearance.'
