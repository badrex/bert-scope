tldr: This article discusses the transformation of science from an individualistic community to a collective enterprise, driven by societal goals and the need for large-scale organization and financing. The author highlights the impact of this change on the internal sociology of science, the tension between individualist norms and managerial principles, and the implications for scientific freedom and responsibility. The author also suggests potential reforms for funding basic research, such as awarding block grants to institutes, to foster innovative research and reduce administrative rigidities.
