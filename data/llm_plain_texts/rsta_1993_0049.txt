tldr: This article investigates the time-evolving displacement of a viscous fluid by another fluid of negligible viscosity in a Hele-Shaw cell, focusing on the effects of surface tension. The study uses conformal maps to describe the interfacial evolution and explores the singularities of the analytically continued map in 1. The findings suggest that the evolution of a Hele-Shaw interface is highly sensitive to initial conditions, especially for small surface tension values.
