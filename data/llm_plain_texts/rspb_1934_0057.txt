tldr: The authors discuss the limitations of traditional plate counting methods for estimating bacterial populations in soil samples. They propose a new ratio method that uses added particles to calculate bacterial numbers, avoiding the need to estimate the mass of soil in the film. This method provides a more accurate and reliable estimation of bacterial content in soil samples.
