tldr: The author investigates the transformation of rotifer eggs into ciliated infusoria, a process known as heterogenesis. By placing rotifer eggs in dark, stone pots, the author observes the development of ciliated infusoria from the egg's contents. This research provides evidence for heterogenesis and sheds light on the diverse forms of organisms that can arise from molecular composition and polarity.
