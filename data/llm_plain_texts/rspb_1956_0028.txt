tldr: The article examines the anatomy and development of the mouse mutants pirouette, shaker-1, and waltzer, which are known for their hearing and behavioral defects. The study reveals that all three mutants experience degeneration of the organ of Corti, spiral ganglion, and stria vascularis, while the utriculus macula remains unaffected. The research also confirms previous findings that double heterozygotes of shaker-1 and waltzer lose their ability to hear around 10 weeks of age but maintain a normal sense of equilibrium.
