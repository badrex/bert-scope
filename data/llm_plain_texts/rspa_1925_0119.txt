tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the absorption and scattering of beta-rays using various filters and an ionization chamber. They found that the absorption of beta-rays is similar to X-rays and that a considerable fraction of the energy of beta-rays is concentrated in a small range of wavelengths. The results support the conclusion that a significant portion of beta-rays' energy is focused on a narrow range of wavelengths, with longer waves being more easily eliminated.
