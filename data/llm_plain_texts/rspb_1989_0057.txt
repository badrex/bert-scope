tldr: The authors present a mathematical model of the carbon metabolism in photosynthesis and examine the role of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate regulation in explaining oscillations. They conclude that oscillations in photosynthesis cannot be caused by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate control of sucrose synthesis alone and that an additional control of photosynthetic rate must be involved.
