tldr: This article presents a method for determining bounds and estimates for the effective yield strength of two-phase composites with prescribed volume fractions and overall isotropy. The authors use the homogenization framework to define the effective yield strength domain of rigid-perfectly plastic composites and propose a variational statement that allows the estimation of the associated effective dissipation functions. They also provide sample results for the effective yield strength of two-phase composites with overall isotropy and estimates and bounds for the effective strength domains of laminated and fiber-reinforced composites with overall transverse isotropy.
