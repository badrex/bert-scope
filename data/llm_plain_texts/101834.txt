tldr: Dr. Papin demonstrated an experiment before the Royal Society that showed how shooting could be achieved through the rarefaction of air, rather than air compression. He used a pneumatic engine to create a vacuum in a pipe, which then propelled a lead ball through the air with a force nearly equal to that of a wind gun. This method could potentially be used to throw heavy weights over great distances.
