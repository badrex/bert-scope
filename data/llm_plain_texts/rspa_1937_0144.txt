tldr: The authors conducted experiments with iso-energetic neutrons to study their capture cross-sections and interactions with various elements. They compared the capture cross-sections of different elements for fast and slow neutrons, finding that the differences were not as large as expected. The results supported the idea that slower neutrons experience a larger capture cross-section, but the differences between fast and slow neutron cross-sections were still relatively small.
