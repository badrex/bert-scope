tldr: This study investigates the properties of spontaneous miniature potentials at denervated frog motor endplates, comparing them to innervated endplates. The results show that Schwann cell-min.e.p.ps have a slower and more variable time course than min.e.p.ps at innervated endplates. The frequency of these potentials remains stable for several hours and is affected by factors such as temperature, calcium concentration, and certain chemicals. The findings provide insights into the functioning of the neuromuscular junction and the role of Schwann cells in neurotransmission.
