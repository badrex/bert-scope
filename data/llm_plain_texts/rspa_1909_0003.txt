tldr: This article compares the radium emanation spectra obtained by different researchers, revealing discrepancies and identifying the presence of xenon contamination in some experiments. The authors conclude that the differences in the spectra are not due to errors in measurement or variations in intensity but are mainly caused by xenon spectra. They emphasize the importance of careful purification and experimental procedures to obtain accurate results.
