tldr: The study investigates the daily changes in the compound eye of a beetle, Macrogyrus, focusing on the structure and function of its eye components. The crystalline cone changes shape between day and night, affecting the eye's ability to form images. The night eye uses a superposition image, while the day eye relies on apposition. The research highlights the importance of understanding the beetle's vision for its survival in its aquatic habitat.
