tldr: The authors propose that elliptical galaxies form from a steady-state situation through an expansion process based on the inhomogeneous steady-state theory. They suggest that a central mass concentration is necessary for the condensation of elliptical galaxies, and the resulting galaxy can have an elliptical shape due to slight deviations from a spherically symmetric expansion. The study also discusses the mass distribution, light distribution, and the origin of spiral galaxies.
