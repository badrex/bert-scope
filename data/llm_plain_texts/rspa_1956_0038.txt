tldr: This article investigates the secondary flow in curved pipes, particularly the effect of curvature reversal on the pattern of streamlines. The author analyzes the flow in a bend with a repeatedly reversed radius of curvature, obtaining a variety of solutions for different entry conditions. The results are compared with experimental observations of air flow through various pipe configurations.
