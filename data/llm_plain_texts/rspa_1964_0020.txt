tldr: The authors studied the transformation of diamond to graphite by heating diamond fragments in a temperature range of 1500 to 1900Â°C. They found that the c-axis of graphite crystallites is oriented perpendicular to the diamond surface at initial stages of graphitization. The process involves two stages: carbon transfer from the diamond lattice to surface carbon, followed by rapid grain growth of the surface carbon to form observed graphite crystallites. The nature of the underlying diamond surface influences the orientations of the resulting graphite crystallites.
