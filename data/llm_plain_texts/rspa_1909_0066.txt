revised_title: 'Mechanism of Absorption Spectra in Solutions'
semantic_tags:
  - Absorption spectra
  - Solutions
  - Inductive capacity
  - Polarization
  - Optical properties
tldr: The authors investigate the mechanism of absorption spectra in solutions, focusing on the inductive capacity and polarization of the medium. They assume a well-defined absorption band with transparent regions on either side and analyze the optical properties of various inorganic salts and dyes.
