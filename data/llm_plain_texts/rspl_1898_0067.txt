tldr: The author, Professor Ralph Copeland, and his assistant, Engineer McPherson, observed the total solar eclipse of January 22, 1898, at Ghoglee in the Central Provinces of India. They used various instruments, including a horizontal telescope and a prismatic camera, to capture images of the solar corona and prominences. The observations and photographs were successful, providing valuable data for further study of solar eclipses and the sun's atmosphere.
