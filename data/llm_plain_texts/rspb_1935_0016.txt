tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the secretion of Brunner's glands in the duodenum. They found that the secretion is not controlled by the vagal or splanchnic nerves and is instead regulated by humoral factors. The authors also discovered that atropine, a drug that blocks the effects of certain neurotransmitters, does not affect the secretion, further supporting the humoral control theory. These findings contribute to the understanding of the gastrointestinal system and its regulation.
