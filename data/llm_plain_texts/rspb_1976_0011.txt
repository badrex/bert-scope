tldr: The authors conducted morphological studies of cell death in T cell mediated cytotoxicity and natural cell death using time-lapse microcinematography. They observed that T cell mediated cytotoxicity and natural cell death share similar morphological changes, suggesting a common pathway to cell death. The study provides insights into the mechanisms of cell death and the role of T cells in cytotoxicity.
