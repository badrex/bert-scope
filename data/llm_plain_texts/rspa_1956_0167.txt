tldr: This article discusses three studies on coliform bacteria strains, specifically their adaptation to D-arabinose, reversion, and interaction between adapted and unadapted strains. The authors found that the selective population shifts in these strains were not dependent on initial proportions but on the previous acclimatization to the specific minimal medium. They also observed a loss of adaptation in some strains and a complex interaction between adapted and unadapted strains.
