  - Molecular potential

  - Lennard-Jones potential
  - Gaussian functions
tldr: The authors present a general functional representation of intermolecular potentials with an unlimited number of parameters, allowing for a more systematic approach to estimating intermolecular potentials. They calculate the second, third, and fourth virial coefficients for three different potentials and discuss the potential for using these calculations to refine the fitting of experimental data for a given molecule.
