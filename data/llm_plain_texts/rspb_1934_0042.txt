tldr: This study investigates the heart's pacemaker, focusing on its location, action potential, and electrical excitability. The researchers found that the pacemaker's location is near the sino-auricular node, and they analyzed the effects of vagal inhibition and accelerants on the pacemaker's rhythm. The findings contribute to understanding the physiological processes behind the heart's rhythmic production of impulses.
