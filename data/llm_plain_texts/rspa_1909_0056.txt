tldr: The author investigates the effect of pressure on the band spectra of fluorides of alkaline earth metals. They find that the bands shift towards the red end of the spectrum under pressure, and the amount of shift is approximately proportional to the pressure. The study also reveals that the relative intensity of the bands remains unchanged under pressure, and the components of the bands widen out under pressure. The author concludes that there seems to be no obvious relation between the magnitudes of the Zeeman effect and the pressure-shift.
