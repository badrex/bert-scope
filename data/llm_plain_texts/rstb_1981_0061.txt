tldr: This article explores the conformations and arrangement of substrates at the active sites of ATP-utilizing enzymes, focusing on pyruvate kinase, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and PP-Rib-P synthetase. The study uses paramagnetic probe and substitution-inert metal-ATP complexes to determine the distances between metal-substrate and intersubstrate, providing insights into the mechanisms of these enzymes and their role in glycolysis.
