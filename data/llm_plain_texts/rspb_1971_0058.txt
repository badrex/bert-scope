tldr: 'The study investigates the motility and energy-rich phosphorus compounds in spermatozoa of the giant octopus, Octopus dofleini martini. The spermatozoa show intense motility at low temperatures and lose it rapidly at higher temperatures. The main energy sources are ATP, ADP, and arginine phosphate. The high concentration of glycogen in the spermatozoa remains constant even after several days of incubation at low temperatures.'
