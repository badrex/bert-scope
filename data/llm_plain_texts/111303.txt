tldr: The author presents an approximate solution to the problem of three bodies, applicable to both planetary and lunar motion. The method provides developments of the radius-vector, longitude, and latitude directly determined by the analysis. This approach avoids assumptions about the forms of the developments and can handle both periodic and secular inequalities. The author demonstrates the practicality of this method by obtaining values of r and Î¸ to terms of the order of the eccentricity multiplied by the disturbing force. Further applications and developments of the method are reserved for future consideration.
