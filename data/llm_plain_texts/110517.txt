tldr: The author conducted a series of experiments on the fermentation of dissolved vegetable matter, including vinous, acetous, and putrefactive fermentations. They analyzed the chemical compositions of these fermentations and found that olefiant gas, water, and carbonic acid were the main components. The author concluded that alcohol and ether are not separate principles but are different combinations of olefiant gas and water.
