tldr: The author discusses the importance of studying fibroblasts in cell culture to understand the effects of tumour viruses. Fibroblasts are social cells that interact with each other and their environment, which affects their growth and behavior. The author explains how these interactions can be influenced by long-range and short-range factors, such as growth factors and cell density. By studying fibroblasts and their response to tumour viruses, researchers can gain insights into cancer development and potential treatments.
