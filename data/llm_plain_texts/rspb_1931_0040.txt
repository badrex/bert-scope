tldr: The authors conducted experiments on corneal grafts in rabbits to determine the factors that affect the return of sensitivity. They found that sensitivity in corneal grafts is dependent on the growth of blood vessels, and grafts that are vascularized become sensitive, while avascular grafts remain insensitive. The study also showed that the site of transplantation, whether central or peripheral, affects the time it takes for sensitivity to return.
