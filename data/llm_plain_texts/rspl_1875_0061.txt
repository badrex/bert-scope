tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the friction between water and air. They measured the force required to propel a jet of water through the air and found that the resistance increased with the velocity of the water. The results were consistent with the equation for the resistance of a jet of water, and the experiments with different gases and materials did not significantly alter the results.
