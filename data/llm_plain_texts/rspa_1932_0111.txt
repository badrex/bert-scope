tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the interaction between gamma radiation and atomic nuclei. They discovered that the secondary radiation emitted by lead had a continuous spectrum and was not solely due to Compton scattering. The results suggested that the nucleus plays a role in the absorption process and that the energy difference between the absorbed quantum and the nucleus in the excited state may involve the expenditure of additional energy.
