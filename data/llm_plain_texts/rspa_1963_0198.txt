tldr: The authors studied the optical properties of antimony tri-iodide crystals, including the ordinary and extraordinary refractive indices, birefringence, and absorption coefficients. They found that the crystals are uniaxial negative and have a long-wavelength absorption edge at about 6000. The absorption spectrum consists of a series of absorption bands attributed to hydrogen-like series of absorption levels. Photoconductivity was observed in the crystals at room temperature, suggesting that the photocurrent arises from the thermal dissociation of exciton states of the halogen doublet.
