tldr: This article describes a series of experiments conducted by William Cruikshank on the nerves and spinal marrow of living animals. He divided the nerves and observed the effects on the animals' bodies, particularly on their thoracic and abdominal viscera. The experiments showed that the original power of action in these organs was independent of the nerves, and that the nerves could regenerate, which was a previously unobserved phenomenon.
