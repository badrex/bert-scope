tldr: This article describes research on exotic option pricing and option pricing when trading the underlying asset incurs transaction costs. It presents a general framework for modeling problems in pricing exotic options with transaction costs using differential equations. The authors discuss various types of exotic options, such as Asian and lookback options, and explain how to incorporate transaction costs into the pricing models. They also explore the effects of discrete sampling of path-dependent quantities on option prices.
