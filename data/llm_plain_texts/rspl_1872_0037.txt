tldr: The author, Frederick Guthrie, investigates the relationship between heat and electricity and how the discharge of electricity is affected by the temperature of a neutral body. He discovers that a hot body can discharge electricity more effectively, and that the discharging power depends on the temperature and distance of the hot body from the electrified one. This research sheds light on the behavior of electricity and its interaction with heat.
