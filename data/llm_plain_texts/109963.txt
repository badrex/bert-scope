tldr: The author, Everard Home, investigates the black rete mucosum in the skin of the negro and its role in defending against the scorching effects of the sun. He suggests that the black pigment in the skin and the eyes of certain animals helps to convert the sun's radiant energy into heat, providing a protective effect against sunburn and injury. This discovery highlights the importance of skin pigmentation in protecting against the sun's rays.
