tldr: The author, John Tomes, examines the dental tissues of various marsupial animals and identifies a unique characteristic in their teeth: the continuation of dentinal tubes into the enamel. This feature is found in most marsupial animals, except for the Wombat, which has teeth similar to rodents. Tomes concludes that enamel and dentine are closely related and should be considered as modifications of each other.
