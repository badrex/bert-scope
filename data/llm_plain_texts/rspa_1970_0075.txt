tldr: The authors investigate the vacancy formation energies in close-packed polyvalent metals, focusing on the changes in the sum of one-electron eigenvalues, the self-energy of displaced charges, and the exchange and correlation energy changes. They calculate self-consistent fields and displaced charges, resulting in numerical values for vacancy formation energies in copper, magnesium, aluminum, and lead. The findings provide a better understanding of the behavior of vacancies in metals and their impact on material properties.
