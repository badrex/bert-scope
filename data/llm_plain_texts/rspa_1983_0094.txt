tldr: The article explores the analytic solutions of functional and difference equations, focusing on the conditions under which a non-constant analytic solution exists. It establishes necessary and sufficient conditions for the functional equation and its corresponding difference equation, and demonstrates the convergence of the power series in a neighborhood of a given point. The study also covers the properties of the coefficients in the power series and the existence of a unique solution.
