tldr: The author suggests an experiment to measure part of the transverse electromagnetic mass of the electron by confining the charge within conducting plates and observing the changes in self-energy. The experiment involves using high-precision atomic beam techniques, such as those used in atomic clocks, to measure frequency shifts caused by the mass changes. The author predicts that the frequency shifts will be inversely proportional to the plate separation.
