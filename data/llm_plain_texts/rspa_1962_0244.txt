tldr: The authors extend Hogarth's approach to time-symmetric electrodynamics to apply to neutrinos in cosmology. They show that in some cosmological models, neutrinos can travel both into the past and future, while in others, only those going into the future can exist. The Einstein-de Sitter and steady-state models serve as examples of these two cases. The authors propose a way to test various cosmologies using neutrino emitters and receivers.
