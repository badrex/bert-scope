tldr: This article explores the mathematical properties of systems of circles and spheres, focusing on the power of two circles and its extension to the case of spheres called spheri-quadrics. The author presents a general relation between the powers of any two groups of five circles and extends these results to small circles on a sphere and spheri-quadrics. The article also discusses the power of a straight line and a circle, as well as the power of two straight lines.
