tldr: This article explores the numerical relationships in binary metallic systems, focusing on the equilibrium diagrams of alloys and the role of valency in determining phase behavior. The author examines the work of Hume-Rothery and others, discussing the importance of size factors and valency in the formation of solid solutions and the development of new phases. The article also presents experimental data on various binary systems, including copper-silver, lead-tin, and cadmium-zinc, to support the author's conclusions.
