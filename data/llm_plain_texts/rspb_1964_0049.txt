tldr: The study examines the growth of endothelium and pseudoendothelium on the healing surface of rabbit ear chambers. Endothelium, which forms a layer one cell thick, covers the tissue completely, while pseudoendothelium consists of various types of cells, including macrophages and fibroblasts. The research provides insights into the structure and regenerative capacity of endothelial cells lining blood vessels and their role in tissue healing.
