tldr: The author investigates the elastic equilibrium of circular cylinders under various practical systems of load, such as pull, compression, and torsion. They analyze the stress distribution and strains in the cylinders and find that the strength of a cylinder under these stress systems is less than the strength of a cylinder under uniform compression. The study helps in understanding the behavior of materials like stone and cement under different loading conditions.
