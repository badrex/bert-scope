tldr: This article extends the work on spherical harmonics and their expansions for crystallographic point groups. The authors develop a new method for calculating auxiliary functions and provide fully orthogonal expansions for the cubic groups up to and including l. They also discuss the orthogonality of the expansions and the use of operators to generate functions that transform like the columns of irreducible representations.
