tldr: 'In 1870, the Royal Society of London rejected the publication of Canadian naturalist Sir William Dawson's Bakerian lecture, which discussed the pre-Carboniferous flora of northeastern America. This incident highlights the challenges faced by scientists working in colonial situations, including communication difficulties and lack of familiarity with the conventions of metropolitan science. Dawson's lecture was not published in the Philosophical Transactions, despite being delivered by other notable scientists in the past. The rejection sheds light on the historical development of the Royal Society's publications and the challenges faced by natural historians in gaining recognition within the scientific community.'
