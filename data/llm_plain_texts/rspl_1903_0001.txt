tldr: The author discovered that using a solution of chloroform in water can eliminate extraneous bacteria from vaccines within a few hours, preserving the potency of the vaccine. This method is faster and more effective than using glycerine, which can take weeks to eliminate bacteria. Chloroform-treated vaccines can be used immediately, saving vaccine material and improving vaccination outcomes.
