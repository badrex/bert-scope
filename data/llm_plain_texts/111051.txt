tldr: The author presents a method to simplify the analysis of numerical equations by decomposing them into conjugate factors. This method, called "rejective intervals," allows for more efficient calculations and can be applied to equations with imaginary roots. The paper provides examples and theorems to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.
