tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the mobility of ions in air and the effect of water vapor on ion mobility. They used an improved experimental method to measure ion mobilities and found that water vapor causes a significant narrowing of the negative ion band, mainly due to the disappearance of ions with a mobility of 1.5. There is also a shift of the band towards lower mobility values.
