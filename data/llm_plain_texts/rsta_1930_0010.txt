tldr: The authors analyze the electric and magnetic state of the Earth's interior by studying terrestrial magnetic variations. They conclude that the Earth's magnetic field is mostly generated within its core, which has a high conductivity. The study of these variations can provide valuable information about the Earth's interior, although more research is needed to understand the exact properties of the core.
