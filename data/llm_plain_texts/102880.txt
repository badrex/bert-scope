tldr: The author, Thomas Molyneux, examines the ancient Greek and Roman lyre and its connection to a passage in one of Horace's Odes. He explains that the lyre was made from the shell of a tortoise and that the "voice of a dying Swan" mentioned in the poem refers to the sound produced by the lyre. Molyneux also provides evidence from other ancient sources to support his interpretation.
