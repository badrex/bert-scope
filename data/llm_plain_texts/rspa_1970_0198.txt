tldr: The authors studied temperature profiles in endothermic and exothermic reactions and their impact on experimental rate data. They derived necessary corrections for temperature-dependent reaction rates and discussed the importance of temperature gradients in determining accurate isothermal reaction constants. The study covers various geometries, including slabs, cylinders, and spheres, and provides insights into the systematic errors in velocity constants and Arrhenius parameters in both endothermic and exothermic reactions.
