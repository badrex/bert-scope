tldr: The author, F. H. Wenham, presents a new formula for designing microscope object-glasses that improve the angle of view and reduce chromatic aberration. The new design uses fewer lenses and a single concave lens of dense flint glass to correct four convex lenses of crown glass. This innovation led to better microscope performance and opened the way for further advancements in microscopy.
