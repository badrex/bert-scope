tldr: This article investigates the relationship between interfacial tension and hydrogen-ion concentration in long chain carbon compounds dissolved in benzene. The authors found that the fall in interfacial tension starts at around pH 5.5 and extends over a range of 4 pH units, which is significant for living matter. The study provides insights into the ionization of interfaces in living cells and the dissociation constant of ionizable groups in an interface.
