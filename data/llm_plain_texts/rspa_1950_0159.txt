semantic_tags:
  - Detonation physics

  - Chapman-Jouguet theory
  - Reaction zones
tldr: This article discusses the fundamental processes of detonation, including the detonation zone, shock waves, and reaction zones. The authors present various theories and experimental studies on detonation velocities, the Chapman-Jouguet equation, and the motion of gases behind a detonation front. They also explore the effects of constraints on detonation velocities and the analogy between detonation and gas flow in heated tubes.
