tldr: This study investigates the structure and mechanical design of the dermal armour of the white rhinoceros. The rhinoceros skin is found to be three times thicker than predicted allometrically, with a dense and highly ordered array of collagen fibers. The skin exhibits high mechanical properties, making it well adapted to resist blows from the horns of conspecifics during aggressive behavior. The dermal armour of the rhinoceros is compared with other mammalian skin and collagenous tissues, providing insights into the unique structure and function of this protective armor.
