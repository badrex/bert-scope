tldr: The authors conducted experiments to examine the assumption that parasites distribute their offspring at random among hosts. They found that the ovipositing females of Collyria calcitrator can select unparasitized hosts for their offspring, indicating that they can distinguish between healthy and parasitized hosts. This challenges the hypothesis of random distribution and suggests that some degree of discrimination occurs in host selection by parasites.
