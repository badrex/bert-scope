tldr: 'The author describes a process of extracting pitch, tar, and oil from a blackish stone found in Shropshire coal mines. The stone, rich in bituminous matter, is ground into a powder and boiled in water to separate the bituminous substance from the stone. The resulting pitch and tar can be used as alternatives to traditional materials for ship maintenance, while the oil can be used as an analgesic. This process has been tested on boats and found to be effective in preventing damage from worms and maintaining a soft, black consistency.'
