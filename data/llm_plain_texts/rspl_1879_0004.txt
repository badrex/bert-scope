tldr: The author critiques the widely accepted hypothesis by Jamieson that the Parallel Roads of Lochaber were formed by glaciers during the glacial period. Instead, the author suggests that the roads were formed during the close of the first period of great glaciation due to the peculiar physiographical conditions of the district. The author argues that the glacial theory, while providing a satisfactory solution, requires a different interpretation of the phenomena.
