tldr: The author investigates the control of nucleic acid charge on the X-chromosome of the hamster, specifically examining the effects of age, breeding season, diet, and disease on heterochromatin. They found that nucleic acid starvation of the differential segment of the X-chromosome occurs under various conditions that lower the frequency of spermatogenesis, such as winter conditions, undernourishment, disease, and old age. This research provides insight into the complex control of nucleic acid metabolism and chromosome behavior in mammals.
