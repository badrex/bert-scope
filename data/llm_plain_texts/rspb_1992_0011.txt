tldr: This study examines the impact of moderate to high worm burdens of Trichuris trichiura infection on the cognitive functions of school children in Jamaica. The research found that removing worms led to significant improvements in tests of auditory short-term memory, scanning, and retrieval of long-term memory. The results suggest that whipworm infection has a reversible adverse effect on certain cognitive functions. Parasitic helminths, such as Aslumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura, infect a quarter of the world's population, with school-age children experiencing the highest prevalence and intensity of infections, leading to undernutrition and iron-deficiency anemia, which can impair cognitive function and learning ability.
