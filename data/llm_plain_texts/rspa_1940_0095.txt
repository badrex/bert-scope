tldr: The authors propose a hypothesis that the charge and spin of an electron can assume higher quantum states to avoid the difficulties of applying the present meson theory to the interaction of fast mesons with nuclear particles. They introduce higher spin and charge states for protons and neutrons, which could explain the anomalous magnetic moments and account for the right magnitude of the magnetic moment. This new theory leads to results consistent with experiments for all effects depending on the interaction of mesons with nuclear particles.
