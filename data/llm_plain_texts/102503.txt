tldr: The author, Dr. Rob Plot, examines the properties of a mineral substance commonly known as Black-Lead, found only at Keswick in Cumberland. He concludes that it is not a metal due to its lack of fusion and ductility, and suggests that it may be classified as a type of earth, specifically a stony sort of close earth, similar to the red and yellow ochres. He proposes the name Ochra Nigra or Black Ochre for this substance.
