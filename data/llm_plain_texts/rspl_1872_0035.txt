tldr: The magnetic survey of Belgium in 1871 revealed significant disturbances in the country's magnetic field, particularly in the south-east portion due to the coal measures. The observations confirmed suspicions of irregularity and showed that the local magnetism could mask the normal direction of the lines when all stations of observation were situated within narrow limits.
