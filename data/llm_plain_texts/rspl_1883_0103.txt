revised_title: Dynamics of a Rigid Body in Elliptic Space
semantic_tags:
  - Rigid Body Dynamics
  - Elliptic Geometry
  - Non-Euclidean Geometry
  - Kinematics
  - Screw Theory
tldr: This article explores the motion of a rigid body under the action of any forces using the generalized concepts of distance in elliptic space, a type of non-Euclidean geometry. The author develops a theory for the motion of a rigid body, investigates the kinematics of a rigid body, and discusses the theory of screws. The article also covers the consideration of the whole momentum of a body, moments of inertia, and the equations of motion.
