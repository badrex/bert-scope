tldr: The authors present a new approach to analyze the dispersion of a solute in a fluid flowing through a tube, removing restrictions on some parameters and describing the distribution of solute in terms of its moments in the direction of flow. They show that the rate of growth of the variance is proportional to the sum of the molecular diffusion coefficient and the Taylor diffusion coefficient, and that a finite distribution of solute tends to become normally distributed.
