tldr: The author investigates a general theorem for finding the length of any arc of a conic hyperbola using two elliptic arcs. This theorem is applied to various problems in mechanics, including the time of descent of a heavy body and the construction of the elastic curve. The author demonstrates that both the elastic curve and the curve of equable recession from a given point can be constructed using the rectification of the ellipse, without failure in any point.
