tldr: This study investigates the effect of adding polymer particles to a thin layer of explosive when impacted. The research confirms that certain polymers, such as polycarbonate and polysulphone, can sensitize explosives, while others, like polypropylene, do not. The sensitizing effect is found to be mechanical, with the production of free radicals by the polymer being of secondary importance. Polymers that sensitize explosives tend to fail catastrophically by fracture or localized adiabatic shear, and have low specific heat, latent heat, and thermal conductivity. The findings have implications for studies of the fracture, friction, erosion, and wear of polymers.
