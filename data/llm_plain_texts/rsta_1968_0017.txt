revised_title: Impulse Noise Exposure and Hearing Loss: A Review and New Criteria
semantic_tags:
  - Hearing loss

  - Damage risk criteria
  - Hearing conservation
tldr: This article discusses the hazards of hearing loss due to exposure to impulse noise and proposes a new specification and damage-risk criterion for high-intensity impulse noise. The authors evaluate existing criteria for noise exposure and suggest that as the duration of exposure becomes shorter, the ear becomes more tolerant to higher levels of noise. They also emphasize the importance of considering individual susceptibility and the need for further research on the relationship between exposure level and duration for equal auditory hazard.
