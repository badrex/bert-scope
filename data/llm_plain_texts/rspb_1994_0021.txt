tldr: The study investigates the effects of food deprivations on chest plumage and primary feather asymmetries in female European starlings. The results show that increasing levels of nutritional stress cause larger development asymmetries, which may have increased fitness costs. Lower levels of feather asymmetries were associated with indicators of reproductive status, supporting the idea that fluctuating asymmetry can reveal aspects of individual fitness value and may be used in mate selection.
