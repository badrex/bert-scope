tldr: The author reexamines the remains of fossil reptiles from the Karroo formation in Cape Colony and challenges the classification of certain specimens. They argue that the forelimb types are too closely related to be referred to different orders of animals, leading to the transfer of Theriodesmus from Mammalia to Therosuchia. The author also examines the skull of Tritylodon longiceps and concludes that it is reptilian, revealing new information about divided roots to the molar teeth in reptiles.
