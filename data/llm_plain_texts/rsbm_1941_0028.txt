tldr: 'Henry Head was a renowned neurologist and physiologist who made significant contributions to the understanding of the human nervous system. His research on respiration, pain sensitivity, and the distribution of afferent fibers in the spinal cord provided valuable insights into the regulation of respiration and the mechanisms of referred pain associated with visceral diseases. Head's work laid the foundation for further studies on the integration of sensory impulses in the brain and the localization of diseases of the spinal cord and its roots.'
