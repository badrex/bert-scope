tldr: This article investigates oscillatory fluxes in highly porous membranes, focusing on the interaction between pressure-driven and electro-osmotic flows. The authors use Nuclepore filters as membranes and analyze the oscillations in pressure and potential difference. A theoretical treatment is developed, considering relaxation rates of concentration profiles and including inertial forces. The study provides a better understanding of membrane oscillations and their potential as analogues for biological phenomena.
