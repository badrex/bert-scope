tldr: This article discusses the phenomenon of glitches in pulsars, which are sudden increases in rotation rate followed by an exponential decay. The authors propose that these glitches are caused by the superfluid nature of the neutron star's interior, where microscopic vortices carry angular momentum. The study of glitches provides valuable insights into the internal structure and dynamics of neutron stars.
