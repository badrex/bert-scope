tldr: The authors successfully cloned the human fibroblast interferon (IFN-P) and human immune interferon (IFN-y) genes. They expressed these genes in monkey cells and studied their properties, including their antiviral effects, enzyme induction, and activation of Natural Killer (NK) cells. The research provides insights into the molecular mechanisms of interferons and their potential applications in medicine and biology.
