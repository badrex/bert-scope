tldr: The author, W.D. Chowne, conducted experiments to understand the relationship between the elastic force of aqueous vapor and its motive force in producing air currents in vertical tubes. The results showed that the velocity of the ascending current in the tube varies inversely as the density or elastic force of the vapor suspended in the atmosphere. This discovery helps to understand the movement of air and water in the atmosphere.
