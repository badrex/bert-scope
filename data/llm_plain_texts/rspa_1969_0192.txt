tldr: The non-isothermal oxidation of 2-methylpentane was studied at high pressures and temperatures. The cool-flame reaction occurs through a free-radical chain process involving homogeneous isomerization and decomposition of alkylperoxy radicals. The reaction is more selective at high temperatures and pressures, leading to the formation of ketoaldehydes and conjugated unsaturated carbonyl compounds, which account for the absorption of ultraviolet light by reacting 2-methylpentane/air mixtures.
