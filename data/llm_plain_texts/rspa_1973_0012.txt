tldr: The authors apply functional analysis to oscillatory ship model testing, demonstrating that linear theory can be accurate when considering'memory effects.' They show that the usual assumption of slow motion derivatives is not entirely accurate and that functional analysis can provide a more precise representation of fluid forces and moments acting on a ship.
