revised_title: 'Fatty Acid Modifies Calcium-Dependent Potassium Channel Activity in Smooth Muscle Cells'
semantic_tags:
  - Potassium channels
  - Calcium channels

  - Fatty acids
  - Membrane fluidity
tldr: The study investigates the effect of 2-decenoic acid (DA) on calcium-dependent potassium channels in smooth muscle cells from the human aorta. The results show that DA increases the probability of the channels being open, suggesting that it alters the calcium-binding mechanism of the channel, increasing its sensitivity to magnesium ions due to membrane fluidization.
