tldr: The study examines the innervation of muscles in axolotl limbs with duplicated proximal segments, induced by vitamin A treatment. The majority of duplicated muscles were not specifically innervated, suggesting that axons must follow prespecified pathways to regenerate correct connections. This finding is not consistent with long-range attraction between nerve and muscle as the primary mechanism for specific nerve regeneration.
