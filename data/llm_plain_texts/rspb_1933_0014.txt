tldr: The authors studied the respiration of potatoes and found that the rate of respiration is affected by the concentration of sugars and the accumulation of an inhibitor at low temperatures. They discovered that the inhibitor accumulates steadily, but its effect on respiration develops slowly. This discovery helps explain the relationship between sugar concentration, temperature, and respiration rate in potatoes.
