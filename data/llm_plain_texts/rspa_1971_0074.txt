tldr: The authors developed a detailed mathematical model of the non-isothermal oxidation of acetaldehyde, which successfully simulates single and multiple cool flames, ignition, and the negative temperature coefficient for slow combustion. The model takes into account fuel consumption and provides a more realistic representation of cool-flame phenomena, offering a better understanding of the underlying thermokinetic oscillations and self-quenching mechanisms. This study contributes to the development of controlled synthesis routes for organic chemicals and the monitoring of fuel octane numbers in refinery streams.
