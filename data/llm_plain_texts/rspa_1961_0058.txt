tldr: The authors studied the temperature coefficients of iodine atom recombination in various gases, finding that the efficiency of different gases as chaperons varies significantly. They proposed a theory of recombination based on the formation of charge transfer complexes, which explains the negative temperature coefficients and the varying efficiency of chaperons. This research helps improve our understanding of chemical reactions and the role of chaperons in recombination processes.
