tldr: The author observed the spectrum of Encke's Comet and found it to be identical to that of Comet II in 1868. The observations also showed that the cometary matter was not yet under the influence of the force that usually repels it from the sun. The author also attempted to detect polarized light in the comet but was unsuccessful.
