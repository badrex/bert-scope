tldr: This study investigates the changes in color perception when the eye adapts to different intensities and colors of light. The researchers used a trichromatic colorimeter to measure these changes and found that adaptation processes affect the sensitivity of the eye to different wavelengths of light. The results provide valuable insights into how the human eye perceives color and can help improve color reproduction in various fields, such as art, photography, and technology.
