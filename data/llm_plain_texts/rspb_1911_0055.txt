tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the eye's sensitivity to variations in wavelengths of light. They found that the eye can distinguish smaller differences in wavelength when dealing with continuous variations in hue, such as in a spectrum, compared to when dealing with monochromatic patches of light. The study also showed that the presence of white light does not affect the eye's sensitivity to changes in hue.
