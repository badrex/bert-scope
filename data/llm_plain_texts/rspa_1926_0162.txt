tldr: The authors discovered 450 new lines in the secondary spectrum of hydrogen, which were not recorded by previous observers. These lines were found during the investigation of a low potential and low-pressure discharge of hydrogen. The authors believe that these new lines are weak in intensity and are likely to be of great importance in understanding the behavior of hydrogen atoms.
