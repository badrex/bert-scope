tldr: This article investigates the dynamic lateral instability of beams, specifically focusing on the vibrations of a deep slender beam bent by forces acting in the plane of maximum stiffness. The author presents a theoretical analysis and an iterative method to predict the frequencies of vibration in cantilever beams. Experiments conducted on an I-section cantilever carrying an end mass support the theoretical analysis and provide insight into the behavior of beams under lateral instability.
