  - Peak shapes
  - Metastable ions
  - Fragmentation reactions
tldr: The authors present a method for calculating the shapes of peaks resulting from fragmentations of metastable ions in a mass spectrometer. They develop a new approach to determine the kinetic energy release distribution directly, without trial and error methods. This method applies to cases with or without discrimination against product ions and can be used for various peak shapes and fragmentation reactions.
