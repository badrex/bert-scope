tldr: This article discusses the measurement of Verdet's constant, which represents the rotation of the plane of polarization of light passing through a magnetic field. The author conducts experiments using distilled water and an electric current in a helix to determine the constant's value in centimeter-gram-second (CGS) units. The results show that the rotation of the plane of polarization is directly proportional to the magnetic potential difference in the water.
