tldr: 'This article studies the iridescent colors and structure of mother-of-pearl. The author investigates the work of previous researchers and conducts experiments to understand the colors' monochromatic character and the role of diffraction by grooves on the surface. The author also examines the absorption spectrum of mother-of-pearl and finds that the main visual reflection is of the second order.'
