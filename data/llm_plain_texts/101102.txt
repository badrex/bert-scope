tldr: The author, Francis Willoughby, shares his observations on the unique breeding habits of a specific type of wasp, called Vespae Ichneumones. These wasps lay their eggs in the bodies of caterpillars and other insects, leading to the development of ichneumon maggots. Willoughby also describes the various ways these wasps care for their offspring and the different behaviors exhibited by these insects.
