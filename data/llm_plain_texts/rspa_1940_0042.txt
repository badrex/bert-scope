tldr: The authors developed a relative method to determine the thermal conductivity of gases using a Kelvin double bridge. They applied this method to deuterium gas, providing a simple and accurate way to measure thermal conductivity in various gas mixtures. This research improved our understanding of gas thermal conductivity and its applications in various fields.
