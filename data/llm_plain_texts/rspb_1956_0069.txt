tldr: The authors discuss the fate of antigens and the concept of immunological tolerance. They suggest that foreign materials in the circulation are removed from tissue fluids by mechanisms similar to those dealing with native materials. The authors propose that foreign antigens may persist within cells of the reticuloendothelial system, which could explain induced tolerance. This hypothesis allows for an explanation of induced tolerance in terms of an acquired ability to break down foreign antigenic substances before they act as antigens.
