revised_title: Reversible Cataracts in Calf and Human Lenses: Light Scattering and Effects of Reagents

  - Reagents for cataract reversal
tldr: The authors discovered reagents that induce or reverse cataracts in calf lenses, which can also clarify human pathologic cataractous lenses. They studied the effects of various reagents on lens transparency and opacification, using methods such as light scattering measurements, scanning electron microscopy, and diffraction of laser light. Their findings suggest that it may be possible to reverse human lens cataracts chemically in situ.
