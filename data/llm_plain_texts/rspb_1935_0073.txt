tldr: This article investigates the physiology of the maternal placenta in rats, focusing on deciduoma formation, endometrial mole, and the insertion gland. The authors review the literature and present their findings on the role of hormones, particularly corpus luteum, in the formation and development of the placenta. They also discuss the general morphology of the rat uterus and the significance of the insertion region in placental development.
