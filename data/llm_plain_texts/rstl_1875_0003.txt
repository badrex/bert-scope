tldr: The author conducted spectroscopic observations to study the differences in the solar spectrum at various sun positions. They discovered that certain atmospheric lines, such as 712 and 813, only appear at specific sunset angles, indicating a strong connection between these lines and the Earth's atmosphere. This research helped to further understand the effects of the Earth's atmosphere on the solar spectrum.
