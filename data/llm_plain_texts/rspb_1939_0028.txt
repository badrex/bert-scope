tldr: The authors conducted experiments using the Cartesian diver ultramicromanometer to measure the respiratory rate of different regions in amphibian gastrulae. They found that the dorsal lip region and ventral ectoderm had similar respiratory rates, contrary to previous studies. The results suggest that the yolk endoderm has a low respiratory rate and occupies a significant portion of the embryo's weight and nitrogen.
