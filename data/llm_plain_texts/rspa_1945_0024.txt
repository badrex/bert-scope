tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the relationship between thermoluminescence, phosphorescence, and electron traps in solids. They developed methods to find the distribution of trap levels at different depths below the conduction band and explored the thermal stability of trapped electrons. Their findings provide a quantitative explanation of phosphorescence in terms of trap distribution.
