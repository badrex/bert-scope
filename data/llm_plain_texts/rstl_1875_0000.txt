tldr: The Royal Society's Committee clarifies the role and function of the Philosophical Transactions, explaining that the Society does not endorse or approve the content of the published papers, but rather selects and publishes papers of importance and singularity. They emphasize that the responsibility for the facts and reasonings in the papers lies with their respective authors. The Committee also addresses the practice of giving thanks to authors and exhibitors at Society meetings and discourages reliance on public notices and reports of their approval.
