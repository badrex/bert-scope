tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the dielectric coefficients of rare gases and hydrogen using a heterodyne beat method. They designed a new gas condenser to overcome temperature equilibrium issues and found that the dielectric coefficients of some gases at liquid air temperature were larger than at room temperature when reduced to equal density. The results provide a comparison of dielectric coefficients for various gases, contributing to the understanding of their properties.
