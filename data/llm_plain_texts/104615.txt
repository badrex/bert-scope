tldr: 'Benjamin Robins observed the height to which rockets ascend and determined that they can reach up to 600 yards. This allows them to be seen at distances of over 50 miles in clear conditions. Robins also suggests that with improvements in rocket design, they may be made to reach even greater distances.'
