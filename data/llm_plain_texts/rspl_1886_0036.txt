tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effects of magnetisation on the length of iron wires under tension. They discovered that the elongation of an iron rod is generally increased by magnetisation, and the critical magnetising force required for maximum elongation decreases when the iron wire is stretched. This research helps to understand the relationship between magnetisation and the physical properties of iron wires.
