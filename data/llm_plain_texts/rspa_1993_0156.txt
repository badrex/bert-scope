tldr: This article explores the use of symmetry properties to derive higher-order bounds for three-component symmetric materials, focusing on equiaxed polycrystals. The author demonstrates how these bounds can improve upon previous bounds without needing additional geometric information beyond equiaxity. The results apply to both three-component locally isotropic symmetric materials and equiaxed polycrystals.
