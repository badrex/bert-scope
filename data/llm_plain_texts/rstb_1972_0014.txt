tldr: The author's study on the large narcissus bulb fly, Merodon equestris, reveals six gene loci responsible for body hair color. The research also shows that the color types most commonly occurring and maintained at high frequency are the best mimics of bumblebees in the United Kingdom. This work provides insights into the evolution of color polymorphism in the species and its relation to mimicry.
