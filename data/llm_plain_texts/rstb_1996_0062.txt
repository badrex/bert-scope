tldr: The article discusses a model of intercellular signaling that explores the possibility of costly signals being exchanged between cells within a body, subject to evolutionary pressures similar to those between individuals with conflicting genetic interests. The authors show that costly intercellular signaling will evolve as a form of quality control, helping identify and remove cells that overrepresent their true phenotypic state, thus improving the overall fitness of the body.
