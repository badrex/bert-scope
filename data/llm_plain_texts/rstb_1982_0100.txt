tldr: This article provides corrections and errata for a previous paper on sulphur bacteria research published in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. The author, J. R. Postgate, and co-author D. P. Kelly, address a discussion contribution by D. M. MacKay and include a reference to his 1976 work on the perception of apparent movement. The corrections aim to improve the accuracy and clarity of the original research.
