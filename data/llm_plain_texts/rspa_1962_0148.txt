tldr: The authors develop a method to solve the mixed boundary-value problem in aerodynamics, focusing on a circular wing and related problems. They apply this method to a lifting surface of circular planform immersed in a uniform stream, considering a plane wing or straight chord lines that may be twisted. The study provides an infinite set of solutions that satisfy null boundary conditions and helps determine lift and moment coefficients.
