tldr: This article presents algebraic research on Newton's Rule for finding imaginary roots in algebraic equations, specifically focusing on equations up to the fifth degree. The author, J.J. Sylvester, provides a demonstration of the rule's validity and discusses the application of invariant criteria to determine the character of the roots in these equations.
