tldr: The authors present a theorem, known as the negative eigenvalue theorem, which can be used to determine the frequency spectra of disordered lattices in two dimensions. They apply this theorem to the problem of lattice vibrations and demonstrate its effectiveness in finding the eigenvalue distribution of matrices related to these systems. The method offers a direct and efficient way to compute frequency spectra for two-dimensional lattices, overcoming some limitations of previous techniques.
