tldr: This article discusses the geological history and tectonic events of the Early and Middle Proterozoic era in the Great Lakes area, North America. It examines the Archean basement, the Huronian and Penokean periods, and the distribution of rock types and structures associated with these events. The author suggests that these orogenic belts may have formed as a result of processes similar to modern plate tectonics.
