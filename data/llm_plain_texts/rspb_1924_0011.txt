tldr: This article discusses the evolution of shell sculpture in freshwater snails of the family Viviparidæ. The author examines the differences in shell patterns between European, Levantine, and eastern species, and explores the correlation between shell structure and the snails' soft parts. The study provides insights into the parallel evolution of three distinct lines of Viviparidæ and the role of environmental factors in their development.
