tldr: The authors investigate the chemical mechanisms behind the secretion of pancreatic juice and the adaptation of the digestive system to changes in food. They discover that the secretion of pancreatic juice is controlled by a chemical substance called secretin, which is produced by the mucous membrane in response to the presence of acid in the small intestine. This substance is then carried by the blood to the pancreas, where it triggers the secretion of pancreatic juice, which aids in the digestion and absorption of nutrients.
