tldr: This article discusses the advantages of using large flux-collectors and field imagers in infrared astronomy. It explores the differences between flux collection and field imaging and how separate telescopes can be optimized for each purpose. The author also highlights the importance of interferometric spectrometers in improving the efficiency of large telescopes and the potential for infrared studies with telescopes that have been limited by flexure.
