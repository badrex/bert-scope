tldr: The article presents an analytical solution to the problem of constructing an orthonormal tetrad that is parallel-propagated along an arbitrary time-like geodesic in Kerr geometry. The authors calculate the components of the tidal tensor explicitly using the constructed tetrad, which can be useful for studying the behavior of a body moving in the Kerr space-time, particularly near a black hole.
