tldr: This study investigates the hydroxyl group in ZSM-5 zeolites using a combination of classical and quantum-chemical calculations. The authors use a cluster model with a small quantum-chemical cluster surrounding the hydroxyl group and a large point-charge cluster representing the rest of the zeolite lattice. They discuss the importance of geometry in electronic properties and report parameters such as O-H vibrational frequency, proton binding energy, and aluminum substitution energy, which have implications for the catalytic properties of ZSM-5 zeolites.
