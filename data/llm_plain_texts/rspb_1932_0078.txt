  - Narcotic effects on brain oxidations
tldr: The authors investigate the effects of narcotics on brain oxidations and their potential role in treating mental disorders. They found that narcotics, such as somnifaine, inhibit the oxidation of substances like glucose, lactic acid, and pyruvic acid in the brain, which may explain the alleviation of psychotic symptoms in some patients. This study highlights the importance of understanding the mechanisms of narcotic action for the development of more effective mental disorder treatments.
