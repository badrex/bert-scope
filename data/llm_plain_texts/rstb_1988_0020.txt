tldr: The article investigates the late Pliocene phase of climatic deterioration around 3.2-2.4 million years ago, focusing on the changes in deep-sea sediment budgets and ocean productivity. The authors analyze sediment samples from various locations in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans during two time slices, 3.4-3.18 and 2.43-2.33 million years ago. They find that the accumulation rates of organic carbon and net palaeoproductivity increased in specific regions, indicating enhanced upwelling productivity during that time. This change led to an increased transfer of carbon dioxide from the surface ocean to the deep water, resulting in the aridification of the Saharan desert belt.
