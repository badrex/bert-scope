tldr: This study examines the structure of hydrogen-oxygen diffusion flames under equilibrium conditions, focusing on the influence of the large hydrogen dissociation activation energy. The authors use the method of matched asymptotic expansions to analyze the flame's temperature and concentration fields. They find that the strong temperature dependence of the equilibrium constant for the hydrogen dissociation reaction leads to difficulties in calculating higher-order terms. However, they propose a solution by redefining the small parameter and provide numerical results for the first significant terms in the series.
