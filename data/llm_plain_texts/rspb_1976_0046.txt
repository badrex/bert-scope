tldr: The authors studied the banding patterns of polytene chromosomes in six species of the melanogaster subgroup of the genus Drosophila. They analyzed the interrelationships between these species and constructed a 'family tree' based on their findings. The study provides insights into the evolution and divergence of these species, although it does not determine the direction of evolution within the group.
