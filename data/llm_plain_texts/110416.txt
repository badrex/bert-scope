tldr: The author refutes the claim that the Teredo navalis, a destructive marine borer, is no longer found on the British coast. They describe the animal's size and its method of perforating and consuming timber. The author also mentions the presence of another destructive species, Limnoria terebrans, which works together with Teredo navalis to destroy wood. Both species were observed at Portpatrick in Ayrshire.
