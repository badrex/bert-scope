tldr: This article discusses the immobilization of high-level waste in ceramic waste forms, specifically focusing on SYNROC, a titanate ceramic composed of hollandite, zirconolite, perovskite, rutile, and minor amounts of metal alloys microencapsulated by the titanate matrix. The article highlights the advantages of ceramic waste forms over borosilicate glass, such as their greater resistance to leaching, flexibility in accommodating waste-stream fluctuations, and long-term geological stability.
