tldr: The article discusses the genetic analysis of cell lineage in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. It reviews three studies of cell lineage mutants, focusing on mutations affecting vulval cell lineages and the analysis of control genes lin-12 and lin-14. The study also highlights the logical features of the genetic program, such as control genes and developmental subprogrammes, and the organization of the lineage into a hierarchy of binary decisions.
