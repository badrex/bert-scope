tldr: This article discusses various modern physical methods in mass spectrometry, such as field ionization kinetics, kinetic energy release measurements, collisional activation, and ion cyclotron resonance. These methods help study the mechanisms of fragmentation and the structures of ions in the gas phase, providing valuable insights into the dissociation processes and chemical reactions involving charged species. The techniques are applied to organic and biological chemistry, offering a better understanding of molecular structures and reactions in solution.
