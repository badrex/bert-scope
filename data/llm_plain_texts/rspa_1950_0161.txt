revised_title: Compressibility and Absorption Frequency of Ionic Crystals: A New Model
semantic_tags:
  - Ionic crystals
  - Compressibility
  - Absorption frequency
  - Electronic distortions
  - Lorentz force
tldr: This article presents a model that takes into account the electronic distortions in ionic crystals, which are not adequately represented by a dipolar term. The model explains the observed deviations from the Lorentz force and leads to the Cauchy relation between the compressibility and absorption frequency, while also accounting for the dielectric constant. The findings have implications for understanding the behavior of alkali halides, which exhibit extreme ionic behavior.
