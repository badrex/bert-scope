tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the thickness of adsorbed layers and the adsorption of gases by solids. They found that the forces of molecular attraction extend to distances greater than the diameter of a molecule, which challenges Langmuir's theory on the mechanism of chemical reactions at solid surfaces.
