tldr: The authors discuss the limitations of measuring space and time in the context of quantum theory. They propose the principle of minimum proper time and introduce the concept of matrix length, which is crucial in understanding the microscopic world. The authors also explore the connection between the quantum equation and the theory of relativity, suggesting that the positron and electron have world lines of opposite signs.
