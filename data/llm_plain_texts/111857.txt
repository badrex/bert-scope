tldr: Joule's experiments investigated the surface-condensation of steam and the factors affecting its conductivity. He discovered that the pressure in the vacuous space remained constant, and the resistance to conductivity was mainly due to the water film on the tube's surfaces. The conductivity increased with the water stream's speed and using a spiral to create rotary motion. However, using atmospheric air as a refrigerating agent resulted in low conductivity.
