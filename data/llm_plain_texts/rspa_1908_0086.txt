tldr: The authors conducted a comprehensive study of the lead-tin eutectic system, determining the equilibrium diagram and the microstructure of the alloys. They discovered that the eutectic point is at 63% tin, and they explained the discrepancies in previous data. The study also revealed a series of transformations in solid alloys near the lead end of the series and the rejection of tin from the solid solution of tin in lead during the transformation process.
