tldr: This article discusses the relationship between active continental deformation and regional metamorphism. It explores how tectonic settings, such as mountain building and plate collisions, can lead to changes in the Earth's crust and upper mantle, resulting in regional metamorphism. The authors also examine the role of earthquakes and faulting in these processes.
