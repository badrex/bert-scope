tldr: This study investigates the behavior of iron during its allotropic transformation, comparing single crystal and polycrystal states. The research focuses on the energy stored in the crystal and surface energy, as well as the heat evolution during the transformation. The results show differences in heat absorption and temperature-time curves for strained and unstrained iron, suggesting that the net result may involve an actual evolution of heat.
