tldr: This article presents a catalog of the immersions and emersions of Jupiter's satellites for the year 1751. The observations were computed to the Meridian of London using the Flamsteedian Tables and corrected by James Hodgfon. The fourth satellite's latitude was too great for an eclipse, and no notice was taken of the eclipses between March 25 and May 24 due to the proximity of Jupiter to the Sun.
