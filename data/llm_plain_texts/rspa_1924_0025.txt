tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study long-range particles emitted by polonium. They discovered two groups of particles with ranges of 6.1 cm and 10 cm, and another group with a range of 13.1 cm. The authors concluded that these long-range particles originate from polonium itself. This research contributed to the understanding of nuclear physics and radioactivity.
