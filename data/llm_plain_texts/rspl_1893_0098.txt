tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effects of sugar on muscle energy and inflammation. They found that sugar significantly increased muscle work and could even reverse the normal diurnal decline in muscular power. Additionally, the author observed changes in blood composition during acute local inflammation, including inspissation, changes in the number of haemic leucocytes, and disturbances in the mutual ratios between different types of leucocytes.
