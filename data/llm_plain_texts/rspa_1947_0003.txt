tldr: The authors develop a general theory for the dynamical properties of a crystal lattice, without assuming any specific atomic forces. They calculate the thermal scattering of X-rays and establish the connection between the elastic constants and the dynamical matrix. The study simplifies the dynamical matrix for a given lattice using space group symmetry considerations.
