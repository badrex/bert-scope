tldr: 'The author, Baden Powell, provides a supplement to his previous paper on the wave-theory of light dispersion and polarization. He discusses the connection between the arrangement of ethereal molecules and the rectilinear or elliptic form of vibrations. He also explains the modification of the criteria for elliptic polarization in the case of light rays coinciding with an axis of elasticity.'
