tldr: The author investigates the pressure of a degenerate electron gas and its related problems, using relativistic principles. They argue that the "ordinary" formula for electron pressure is the exact relativistic solution, contrary to the "relativistic" formula. The findings have implications for dense stars, quantum theory, and the union of quantum theory with relativity theory. The author also determines the value of the cosmical constant and sheds light on various side problems, such as negative energy levels and the connection between macroscopic theory and wave mechanics.
