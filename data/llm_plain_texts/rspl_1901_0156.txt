tldr: The author explores the effects of low temperatures on crystal luminosity and pyro-electricity. They discovered that crystals like nitrate of uranium and platino-cyanides exhibit self-luminosity and electric discharges when cooled to extremely low temperatures. This phenomenon is due to the high electric potential generated by the cooling process. The study of pyro-electricity at low temperatures has the potential to solve important problems in the field.
