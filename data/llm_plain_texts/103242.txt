tldr: 'In 1708, two Missionary Jesuits, Paul Clain and Father Le Gobien, documented the discovery of new Philippine Islands and the incredible journey of 35 people from these islands who were driven out to sea for 70 days before reaching the Isle of Samal. The stranded individuals were helped by a local Guivamois, who swam to their vessels and guided them to safety. The Jesuits also described the culture, language, and way of life of the inhabitants of these islands, including their survival techniques at sea and their interactions with the local population.'
