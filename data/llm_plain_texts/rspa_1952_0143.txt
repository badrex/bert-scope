tldr: The authors developed a method to directly measure the electrical potential difference between a cellulose membrane and an aqueous solution. They found that the potential difference varies with the concentration of electrolyte and can be successfully calculated using the Donnan principle of membrane equilibrium. This study provides insights into the interaction between cellulose and solutions, which is essential for understanding dye adsorption and other processes involving cellulose-based materials.
