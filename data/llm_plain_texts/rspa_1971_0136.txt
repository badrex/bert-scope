tldr: The authors investigated the influence of bromine compounds on the combustion of polyolefins, specifically focusing on the oxidative degradation of polyethylene and polypropylene. They found that neither bromine incorporated into the polymer nor hydrogen bromide in the surrounding atmosphere significantly affected the rate of mass loss. However, the presence of bromine compounds did affect the nature of the volatile products formed during oxidation. The authors used a flow system to study the reactions in both the liquid and gaseous phases, and their results showed that bromine compounds can promote or inhibit oxidation depending on the polymer type and experimental conditions.
