tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the ultra-violet absorption spectra and specific extinction coefficients of serum proteins, particularly focusing on serum pseudo-globulin. They found that pseudo-globulin obeys Beer's law and confirmed the specific extinction coefficient of serum pseudo-globulin. The method of preparing and separating serum globulins does not affect their ultra-violet absorption spectra.
