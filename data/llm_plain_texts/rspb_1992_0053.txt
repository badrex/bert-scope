tldr: The article discusses intragenomic conflict as a driving force in evolution. It explores the conflicts between genes within an individual for transmission into the next generation, focusing on the evolution of sex, sexes, sex ratio, sex allocation systems, sex determining systems, and post-zygotic isolation. The author argues that understanding intragenomic conflict can provide insights into various evolutionary processes and biological phenomena.
