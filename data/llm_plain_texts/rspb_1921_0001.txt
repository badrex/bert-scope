revised_title: 'The Role of Medium Reaction in Fixing Enzyme Optimum Temperature'
semantic_tags:
  - Enzyme kinetics
  - Optimal temperature
  - Acid medium
  - Maltase
  - Enzyme concentration
tldr: The author investigates the effect of the reaction of the medium on the optimum temperature of a ferment, specifically focusing on the enzyme maltase. They discovered that increasing the acidity of the medium lowers the optimum temperature, and adding more enzyme does not change the rate of hydrolysis. This study provides insight into the mechanism of enzyme action and the independence of the optimum temperature of an enzyme from its concentration.
