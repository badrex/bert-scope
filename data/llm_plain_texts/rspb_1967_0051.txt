tldr: The study investigates the regeneration of nerve fibres controlling colour changes in minnows after spinal section. The researchers found that varying degrees of recovery of rapid colour change appear to be the result of regeneration of chromatic fibres in the spinal cord. The colour and pattern produced by melanophores were affected equally over the whole body as the recovery of rapid colour change proceeded, suggesting that each chromatic nerve fibre in the cord contributes to the state of excitation of a postganglionic system common to all melanophores in the skin.
