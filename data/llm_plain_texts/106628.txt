tldr: The author, Robert Waring Darwin, conducted experiments to study ocular spectra, which are images that resemble the object being observed after looking at it for a while. He discovered that the retina is in an active state during the existence of these ocular spectra, suggesting that all vision is due to the activity of this organ. Darwin also observed that the retina has a fibrous structure, similar to muscles, and discussed the similarities between the actions of the retina and muscles.
