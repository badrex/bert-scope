tldr: The author, William Crookes, examines the phosphorescent spectrum of erbia, a rare earth element, and discovers four distinct green bands. He compares erbia's spectrum to those of yttrium and samarium and finds that they do not match. Crookes also studies the absorption spectrum of erbic chloride and the spectra emitted when erbia is heated or in a spark. He highlights the unique properties of erbia and its differences from other elements.
