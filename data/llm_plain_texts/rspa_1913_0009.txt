tldr: The authors investigate the scattering and absorption of light in gaseous media, with applications to the intensity of sky radiation. They introduce a second term in the differential equation for loss of intensity in a beam of radiation, accounting for absorption without scattering. They also consider the effects of self-illumination on the intensity of sky radiation and apply their findings to the problem of absorption and scattering of solar radiation by the Earth's atmosphere.
