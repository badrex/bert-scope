tldr: The authors investigated the electron transfer between chlorophyll and quinones in a lecithin matrix, finding that the quenching process occurs from the chlorophyll singlet state. The quenching ability is directly related to the oxidation potential of the quinone, and a model based on a random distribution of molecules was used to interpret the results.
