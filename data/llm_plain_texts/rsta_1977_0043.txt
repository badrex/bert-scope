tldr: This article discusses the comparative chemical history of the Earth, the Moon, and the parent body of achondrite meteorites. It presents chronological and chemical data from lunar samples and achondrites, suggesting that major chemical fractionation occurred at 4.4 Ga for the Moon and 4.56 Ga for the achondrite parent body. The Earth's chemical differentiation has continued or is still ongoing, as indicated by chronological and isotopic evidence.
