tldr: The author examines a large stone found in a horse's stomach and analyzes its composition. The stone is similar in appearance to a type of pyrites but is much denser. The author conducts tests to determine the stone's constituent parts, concluding that it is made up of an earth, air, mucus from the horse's stomach, and a saline principle resembling sal ammoniac. This study provides insight into the formation of such stones in horses and their potential treatment.
