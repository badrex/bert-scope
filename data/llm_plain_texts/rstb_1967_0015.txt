tldr: The authors discuss the temperature relationships of Antarctic vegetation and how they affect plant distribution. They find that low temperatures, snow cover, and wind play a significant role in the growth and survival of plants in Antarctic regions. The study highlights the importance of microclimates, aspect, and sheltered habitats for the establishment and performance of vegetation in these extreme environments.
