tldr: This article explores the effects of tidal stirring gradients on the biological processes in the North Sea. The authors propose that tidal flow, seasonal variations in heating, and wind stirring are the main factors controlling plankton in the southern North Sea. They use a numerical model to test their hypothesis and compare it with observations of seasonal cycles and spatial variations in phyto- and zoo-plankton. The study highlights the importance of tidal mixing fronts, residual circulation, and nutrient-rich river discharges on microplankton community production and its fate.
