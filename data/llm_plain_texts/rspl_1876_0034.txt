tldr: The author analyzes the daily range of atmospheric temperature recorded at Kew Observatory from 1855 to 1875. They find that the temperature range is greatest in summer and least in winter. The author also investigates the relationship between the temperature range and the sunspot and lunar cycles, suggesting that there may be a connection between these factors and the daily temperature range.
