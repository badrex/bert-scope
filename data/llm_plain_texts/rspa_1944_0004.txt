tldr: The authors investigated the frictional behavior of mild steel surfaces lubricated with long-chain halides, acids, and other compounds. They discovered that the transition from smooth sliding to stick-slips occurs when the adsorbed film on the surface decreases. The results suggest that these compounds are adsorbed by interacting with the metal surface's dipoles and not by chemical reactions. This study provides insights into the mechanism of adsorption and orientation of molecules at the surface.
