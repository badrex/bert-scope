tldr: The authors discovered and characterized three different enkephalin-degrading enzymes, enkephalinase Ax, A2, and B, in the brain. These enzymes are responsible for breaking down enkephalin peptides, which are thought to act as neurotransmitters. The researchers found that enkephalinase Ax and A2 generate the Tyr-Gly-Gly fragment, while enkephalinase B generates Tyr-Gly. These enzymes have different substrate specificities and regional distributions within the brain, suggesting distinct roles in the inactivation of enkephalins. The purification and characterization of these enzymes provide insights into the physiological inactivation of enkephalin neurotransmitters.
