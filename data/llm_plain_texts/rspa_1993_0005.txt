tldr: The authors studied the thermal decomposition of dehydrated d-lithium potassium tartrate monohydrate and found that the reaction mechanism involves anion decomposition within an advancing thin layer of molten material. The decomposition rate was increased by crushing the crystalline reactant hydrate, which underwent rapid initial dehydration before the onset of the anion breakdown reaction. The activation energy for salt decomposition was relatively large, at 220 + 20 kJ mol⁻¹. This study contributes to understanding the role of melting during chemical changes and extends the knowledge of reaction kinetics in solid-state chemistry.
