tldr: The author discusses the sequence of movement and rhythm in the mammalian heart, focusing on the origin and propagation of the contraction wave. They describe the challenges of studying the mammalian heart and the development of electrical methods for recording heartbeats. The author identifies the sino-auricular node as the starting point of the contraction wave and explains how the wave travels through the heart, influenced by the functional integrity of the heart's muscle tissue.
