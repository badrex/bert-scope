tldr: The author investigates the absorption spectra and latent heats of vaporization of monosulphides of alkaline earth elements. They calculate the lattice energy and grating energy using Born's cycle and Born-Gerlach's formula, and discuss the implications of their findings on the photo-dissociation of these compounds. The study provides insights into the thermochemical properties and absorption behavior of these monosulphides.
