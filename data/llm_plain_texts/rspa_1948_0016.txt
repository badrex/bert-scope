  - Doppler effect
tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the fluctuations in a tidal current and their relationship with surface waves. They observed that the current fluctuations and wave periods were of the same order, and the amplitude of the pressure oscillations showed no significant dependence on the mean current. The study also found that the rate of attenuation of wave amplitudes with depth was consistent with theoretical predictions. The authors discuss the challenges in analyzing the data, such as the presence of multiple wave periods and the inability to make simultaneous observations at different depths.
