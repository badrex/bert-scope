tldr: 'Researchers used DNA fingerprinting to study 183 broods of house sparrows and found that 13.6% of nestlings were unrelated to the attendant male, indicating cuckoldry. Cuckoldry was more frequent in broods with insertile eggs, suggesting that sperm competition can be influenced by the fertility of the cuckolded male. This study implies that females may benefit from extra-pair copulation as an insurance against their mate's fertility issues.'
