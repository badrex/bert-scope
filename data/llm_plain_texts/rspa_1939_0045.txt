tldr: This study investigates the effect of various electrolytes on the interfacial tension between water and dekalin. The results show that the interfacial tension increases with the concentration of the electrolyte. The behavior of different electrolytes at the interface is complex and cannot be explained by traditional theories. The study suggests that the forces in the first adsorption layer play a significant role in understanding the observed effects.
