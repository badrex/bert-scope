tldr: The study investigates the impact of various androgenic and oestrogenic compounds on the histological structure of the pituitary gland in castrated rats. The results show that certain hormone preparations can prevent the development of characteristic histological changes in the anterior pituitary of castrated rats. The effectiveness of these compounds varies, and they are compared with oestrone and crude testis extracts. The study highlights the importance of understanding the oestrogenic and androgenic properties of these compounds in treating castration-related changes in the pituitary gland.
