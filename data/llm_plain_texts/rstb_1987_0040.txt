tldr: This article discusses the importance of the planktonic ecosystem in the North Sea in the context of oil and gas development. It examines the changes in the population structure of phytoplankton and zooplankton in areas with oil fields and compares the energy yields of oil and gas with the energy production of the ecosystem components. The study highlights the potential impact of oil pollution on the benthos and fish and emphasizes the need to assess the development of petroleum extraction in relation to possible pollution effects.
