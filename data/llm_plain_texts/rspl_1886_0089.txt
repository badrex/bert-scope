tldr: The authors conducted experiments to develop a reliable and accurate method for measuring high temperatures using the platinum thermometer. They found that by comparing the resistance of different metals, such as platinum and iron, at various temperatures, they could establish a standard for temperature measurements. This method allowed for precise temperature comparisons across a wide range, making it a valuable tool in scientific research and industry.
