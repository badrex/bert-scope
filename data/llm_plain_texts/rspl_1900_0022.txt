tldr: This article investigates the poisonous properties of the Lotus Arabicus plant and discovers that it contains a yellow crystalline glucoside called lotusin, which breaks down into prussic acid, sugar, and lotoflavin. The study also explores the enzyme lotase, which is responsible for the hydrolysis of lotusin and the release of prussic acid. The research has implications for understanding the effects of the plant on animals and potential remedies.
