tldr: The author conducted experiments with madder-root, a plant known for its coloring properties, to observe its effects on living animals' bones. They discovered that the madder-root caused the bones of the animals to turn red without affecting other parts of their bodies. The author also noted that the coloring occurred more in the harder bones and that the process could be reversed by changing the animal's diet.
