revised_title: 'Effect of Repetitive Stimulation on Presynaptic Terminal Electrical Properties in Squid Giant Synapse'

  - Squid neuroscience
  - Presynaptic terminal
  - Neurotransmitter release
tldr: The study investigates the passive electrical properties of the presynaptic terminal of the squid giant synapse and observes changes during repetitive stimulation. The terminal resistance, time constant, and capacitance increase after short periods of stimulation, suggesting a link between these changes and neurotransmitter release.
