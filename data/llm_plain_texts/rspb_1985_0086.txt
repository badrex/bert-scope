tldr: This article explores how retroviral oncogenes, specifically v-erb B and v-erb A, induce transformation in avian erythroid cells. The author explains that these oncogenes alter the differentiation program of the infected erythroid precursor cells, resulting in hormone-independent leukemia cells. The study focuses on the role of the erb B protein, a truncated version of the EGF receptor, in this process.
