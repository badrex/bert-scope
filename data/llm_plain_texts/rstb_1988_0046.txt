tldr: The article discusses the progress made in molecular cytogenetics, which has greatly contributed to the precise analysis of human chromosomes. Techniques such as flow cytogenetics, DNA probes, and in situ hybridization have allowed for the detection of smaller chromosome aberrations and the determination of their parental origin. These advancements have improved the diagnosis and understanding of genetic diseases and their underlying causes.
