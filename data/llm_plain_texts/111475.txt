tldr: The author, Arthur Cayley, discusses the surface that is the envelope of planes through the points of an ellipsoid at right angles to the radius vectors from the center. He explains how to obtain the equation of the curve and surface using cubic and quartic functions. The surface has nodal conics in each principal plane and a cuspidal curve. The paper includes a figure showing the form of the surface for a specific case.
