tldr: The authors conducted a comprehensive investigation of the critical values for the M group of elements, including chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, and zinc, to understand the development of inner electron groups. They used the critical potential method to measure the photoelectric current from metallic plates caused by X-radiation emitted by the elements under electronic bombardment. The results confirmed the view that the M group of electrons is in the process of development in this region of the periodic classification.
