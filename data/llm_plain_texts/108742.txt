tldr: The author investigates the relationship between liquid transpiration and chemical composition, focusing on the behavior of hydrates. They use a capillary tube experiment to measure the transpiration time of various liquids, including nitric acid, and observe how the chemical composition affects the transpiration rate. The study reveals that certain hydrates, such as nitric acid, have distinct transpiration properties that can be used to identify and understand their chemical makeup.
