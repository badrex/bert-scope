tldr: The author conducted experiments on a large-scale sewage treatment plant to study the effects of depth and particle size in filtration. They discovered that finer particles provide a larger surface area for bacterial growth, leading to better nitrification and purification of sewage. The study also found that nitrification occurs in stages, with different sets of organisms located in different layers of the filter.
