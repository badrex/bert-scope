tldr: The author examines the fossilized flora found in Bovey Tracey, identifying the plants as belonging to the Miocene period. The discovery of Sequoia Couttsice, a conifer linking various Sequoia species, is of great interest. The author also discusses the possible climate and environment of the region during the Miocene, suggesting that it was sub-tropical with an inland lake. The absence of fresh-water shells and aquatic animals is noted, as well as the presence of a cold climate indicated by Betula nana, an Arctic plant not typically found south of Scotland.
