revised_title: 'Further Irradiation of Radiation Products of Ergosterol: Implications for Vitamin D and its Absorption Spectrum'
semantic_tags:
  - Vitamin D
  - Ergosterol
  - Absorption Spectrum
  - Re-radiation
  - Antirachitic Activity
tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of further irradiation on the radiation products of ergosterol. They discovered that re-radiation with short waves caused a rapid loss of antirachitic activity and a large rise in absorption at 280 mμ, while re-radiation with longer waves resulted in a smaller fall in activity. These findings provide evidence that the substance absorbing at 280 mμ is not vitamin D and support the idea that ergosterol can directly convert to an unstable substance formed simultaneously with vitamin D.
