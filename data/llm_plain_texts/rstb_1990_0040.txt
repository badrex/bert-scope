  - Wing beat
tldr: The authors investigated the wing beat kinematics of Drosophila melanogaster using artificial slow-motion pictures generated by synchronizing strobe flashes with the insect's wing beat. They analyzed the wing path, angles of attack, and other variables, providing a basis for future aerodynamic calculations and understanding of flight mechanisms in small insects.
