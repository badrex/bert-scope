tldr: This article presents a method to derive an expansion for the bulk properties of a statistically homogeneous, random suspension. The expansion involves only absolutely convergent integrals and is applicable to situations where interactions between particles fall off more slowly, causing long-range effects. The study focuses on spherical particles and uses a heat conduction problem as a specific example.
