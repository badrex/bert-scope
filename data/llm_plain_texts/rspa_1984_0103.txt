tldr: The authors investigate the interactions between a marginally unstable wave and slightly damped waves in a quasi-geostrophic two-layer flow on a beta plane. They find that nonlinear interactions can lead to friction-induced explosive instability, which may explain the rapid growth of certain events of cyclogenesis observed in the atmosphere and oceans.
