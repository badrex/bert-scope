tldr: A case study of a newborn girl born with a large wound in her breast, supposedly caused by the force of imagination. The mother had heard a report of a man murdering his wife with a knife wound in her breast, which frightened her. The child's wound healed after being treated similarly to a fresh wound, suggesting that the wound was indeed caused by the mother's imagination at the time of the report.
