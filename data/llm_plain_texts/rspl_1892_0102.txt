tldr: The author discusses the temperature changes in the brain and muscles during stimulation, such as electric currents or cocaine injection. They found that the brain's temperature rises more significantly and lasts longer than muscle temperature. This research may help understand the phenomena of life and improve safety-lamp technology for gas testing.
