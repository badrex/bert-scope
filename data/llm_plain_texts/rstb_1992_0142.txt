tldr: This article discusses the information stored in Antarctic ice cores, which provide a record of past climate and environmental changes. The authors analyze temperature, precipitation, atmospheric composition, and aerosol data from ice cores, revealing the impact of greenhouse gases on global climate. The findings suggest that climate sensitivity to greenhouse gas forcing is consistent with General Circulation Models, highlighting the importance of further ice core research for understanding the Earth's climate system.
