tldr: In 1825, Gideon Mantell discovered the Iguanodon, a new species of herbivorous reptile, in the sandstone of Tilgate Forest, Sussex. Mantell studied the teeth and bones of this massive creature and compared them to modern lizards, concluding that the Iguanodon was a unique and fascinating addition to the fossil record. The discovery of the Iguanodon helped expand our understanding of prehistoric life and the geological history of the area.
