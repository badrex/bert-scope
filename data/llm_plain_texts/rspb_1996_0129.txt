tldr: The article explores the macroscopic patterns and growth dynamics of mycelial networks in fungi. The authors develop a mathematical model that simulates the self-organizing behavior of mycelial networks, considering factors such as energy acquisition, biomass production, and environmental context. The model predicts various observable patterns in mycelial growth, including traveling wave fronts, annular patterns, and localized variations in biomass density. These findings provide insights into the complex dynamics of fungal colonies and their potential applications in understanding pattern formation in other indeterminate living systems.
