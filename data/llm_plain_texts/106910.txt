tldr: The author, John Godfrey Schmeisser, discovered a new mineral substance called Strontionite found in Scotland. It has a unique greenish color, fibrous texture, and is soluble in nitric and muriatic acids. The author conducted various experiments to analyze its physical and chemical properties, including its reaction with acids, and found that it contains a new earth called Strontion earth. Strontionite also has a crystalline structure and is related to other minerals like barytes and witherite.
