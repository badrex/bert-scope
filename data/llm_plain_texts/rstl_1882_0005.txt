tldr: 'G. H. Darwin investigates the stresses caused in the Earth's interior by the weight of continents and mountains. He uses mathematical analysis and elasticity theory to determine the distribution of stress and the direction of principal stresses in the Earth. This study helps to understand the forces shaping the Earth's surface and the potential impact of these forces on the planet's structure.'
