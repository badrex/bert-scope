tldr: The authors present a new approach to understanding nuclear excitation and disintegration collisions involving strong interactions. They explain that the initial assumptions concerning the probability of elastic collisions cannot be valid for closely packed nuclei. Instead, they propose a new method to deal with problems of a three-body nature, such as proton-nuclear core-proton, where the nuclear core is treated as a single particle. They describe in detail the results of these calculations for excitation and disintegration phenomena, providing insights into the way the usual approximation needs modification.
