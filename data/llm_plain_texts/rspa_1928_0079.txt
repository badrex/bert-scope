tldr: The authors investigated the crystal structure of naphthalene tetrachloride and dichlor-naphthalene tetrachloride using X-ray diffraction. They found that the crystal structure of both compounds has a body-centered monoclinic lattice. The study helped determine the position of halogen atoms and the orientation of the molecules within the crystal structure.
