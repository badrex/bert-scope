revised_title: Spontaneously Broken Symmetry and the Cusp Catastrophe: A Catastrophe Theory Perspective
semantic_tags:
  - Catastrophe Theory
  - Spontaneously Broken Symmetry
  - Higgs Mechanism
  - Symmetry Breaking
  - Maxwell Convention
tldr: This article discusses spontaneously broken symmetry from the perspective of catastrophe theory, specifically focusing on the cusp catastrophe. The authors demonstrate that spontaneously broken symmetry is a special case of the usual symmetry breaking and explain the Maxwell convention in the context of the cusp catastrophe. The findings have implications for understanding the Higgs mechanism and phase transitions in particle physics.
