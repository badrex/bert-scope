tldr: The author proposes a method for avoiding sea collisions using synchronized signals transmitted through different media, such as wireless and submarine bells. This method allows sailors to estimate the distance between ships and determine if they are on a collision course or passing safely. The system is already in use to assist mariners navigating the approach to New York Harbor.
