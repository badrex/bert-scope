tldr: The author conducted a study on the temperature of humans within the tropics, measuring the body temperature of an individual at different times of the day and under various conditions. The results showed that the body temperature was generally lower in the morning and higher at night, with fluctuations influenced by factors such as sleep, bed covering, and the quality of the surrounding atmosphere. The study also demonstrated how the body temperature responds to exercise and other physical activities, highlighting the importance of thermoregulation in maintaining health in tropical climates.
