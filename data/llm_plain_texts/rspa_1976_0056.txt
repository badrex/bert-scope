tldr: The author presents a solution for the vector potential of a vacuum Maxwell field in Kerr geometry using Teukolsky's radial and angular functions. The solution is derived from the Newman-Penrose formalism and provides a direct and simple method for determining the components of the potential in a general gauge. The findings can be applied to the study of electromagnetic perturbations of the Kerr black hole.
