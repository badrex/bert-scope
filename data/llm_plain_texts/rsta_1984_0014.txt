tldr: This article investigates the petrogenesis of Andean volcanic rocks, focusing on the relative contributions of mantle, oceanic crust, and continental crust to magma formation. The authors analyze the chemical and isotopic characteristics of volcanic rocks from different zones of the Andes, concluding that the complex process of magma formation involves source composition, fractional crystallization, and crustal contamination during the ascent through the continental crust.
