tldr: This study examines the health of Yemenite and Kurdish Jews in Israel, focusing on their fitness for physiological tests and the prevalence of diseases. The research found that 15% of the population aged 20-30 were unfit for tests, with cardiovascular disorders, anemia, and hepato-splenomegaly being the most common conditions. Dental health was generally satisfactory, with a higher decay rate among Kurdish Jews compared to Yemenite Jews. The study suggests that the morbidity rate in these communities is not exceptional for a rural population.
