tldr: This article discusses the introduction of valve amplifiers to the Cambridge Physiological Laboratory by E.D. Adrian, which marked the beginning of the electronic revolution in life sciences. Adrian's use of valve amplifiers allowed for the enlargement of small electrical signals, making it easier to record and analyze electrical impulses in nervous tissue. This development had a significant impact on the field of neurophysiology and paved the way for further advancements in life sciences.
