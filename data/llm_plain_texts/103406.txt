tldr: A woman named Anna Mullern, who lived a healthy life until her 94th year, claimed to have been pregnant for 46 years. Despite giving birth to two children during this time, she believed she was still carrying a fetus. After her death, a surgeon opened her body and discovered a large, bony mass, which some speculate may have been lodged in the left Fallopian tube. This case offers a unique insight into the mysteries of prolonged pregnancy and fetal development.
