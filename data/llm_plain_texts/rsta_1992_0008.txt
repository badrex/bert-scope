tldr: This article investigates the head-on collision of normal shock waves with rubber-supported walls, both theoretically and experimentally. The authors develop a physical model for describing the collision process and study three different modes of rubber loading. They find good agreement between experimental and numerical results, validating the model and its numerical solution. This research contributes to understanding shock wave interactions with flexible boundaries and has applications in various engineering and medical fields.
