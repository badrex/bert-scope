tldr: The authors conducted experiments on various types of Indian cotton plants, focusing on their branching patterns, leaf factors, and other characteristics. They found that these traits are heritable and can be used to classify and improve cotton varieties for better yields and commercial success. The study also highlights the importance of understanding plant genetics and breeding for sustainable agriculture.
