tldr: This article presents a modified Rayleigh-Ritz method for solving boundary-value problems with non-removable singularities, focusing on practical applications in engineering. The method allows for a more extensive exploitation of singular functions and provides a versatile mode of calculation. The author demonstrates the effectiveness of the method in solving a one-dimensional interpolation problem and a plane harmonic mixed boundary-value problem. Finally, the article applies the method to the plane stress elastic analysis of plates with cracks, which is essential in fracture mechanics and predicting structural failure.
