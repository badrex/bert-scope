tldr: The author conducted experiments on the magnetic changes of length in annealed rods of cobalt and nickel. They found that the dimensions of annealed cobalt and nickel change differently when subjected to a magnetic field. The results showed that annealing affects the behavior of these metals in a magnetic field, with the contraction in annealed cobalt continuing without reaching a limit, and the maximum retraction in annealed nickel occurring in a similar field strength. The author also compared the results with previous studies on iron and nickel.
