tldr: 'The authors conducted continuous seismic reflexion profiles in the Red Sea to study its structure and evolution. They found that the main trough is characterized by mildly deformed sediment layers along the margins and highly disturbed materials in the deeper axial trough. The strong seismic reflector observed at depths up to 600 meters beneath the main trough may represent an unconformity of late Miocene-Early Pliocene age. The authors concluded that the formation of the Red Sea resulted from crustal separation of Africa and Arabia, with seafloor spreading rates of 0.4 to 0.7 cm per year in the axial trough.'
