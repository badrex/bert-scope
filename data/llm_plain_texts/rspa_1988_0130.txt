tldr: The authors investigate the smoothness of Cauchy-evolved space-times in the context of general relativity. They consider a 1-parameter family of solutions to the vacuum constraint equations and perform a perturbation expansion around Minkowski space. The study concludes that the family cannot be smooth at the expansion parameter and simultaneously have members with smooth properties at infinity. The results suggest that the question of smoothness may not be resolved through perturbation theory.
