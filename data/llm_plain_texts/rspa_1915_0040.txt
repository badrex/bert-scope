tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the ionization potentials of mercury, cadmium, and zinc by analyzing their single- and many-lined spectra. They found that the minimum ionizing potentials for these elements are 4.9 volts, 3.96 volts, and 3.74 volts, respectively. The results support the quantum theory and provide insights into the energy required to ionize atoms and the nature of their spectra.
