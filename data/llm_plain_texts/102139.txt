tldr: The author, Anthony Leewenhoeck, observed and described the various shapes and sizes of salt particles in vinegar and wine using a microscope. He found that these particles were responsible for the sour taste and that they changed shape when exposed to different conditions, such as the presence of crabs' eyes. Leewenhoeck also discussed the role of these salt particles in the human stomach and their potential impact on digestion.
