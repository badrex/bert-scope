tldr: The author explains that the mineral assemblage in most chondritic meteorites is not directly formed from solar matter. Instead, they suggest that the major minerals of ordinary chondrites have chemical compositions indicative of formation from a medium greatly depleted in hydrogen and somewhat deficient in oxygen relative to solar matter. This depletion in hydrogen and oxygen led to the re-evaporation of condensed material, which then formed the minerals of the ordinary chondrites.
