tldr: This study investigates the enhanced ultraviolet (UV) sensitivity of frozen bacteria and its relation to cellular mechanisms for repairing radiation damage. The researchers found that damage induced by UV at low temperatures is less amenable to repair by the DNA repair systems than damage induced at room temperature. The results suggest that either the damage inflicted at low temperatures is less repairable or the repair systems are inactivated by low doses of UV at -79Â°C.
