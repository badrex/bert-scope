tldr: This biographical memoir of Louis de Broglie, the French physicist who made one of the greatest discoveries of the 20th century - the wavelike nature of all matter, explores his life, family background, and contributions to science. Born into an illustrious family, de Broglie was initially expected to follow a career in politics or the military, but his interest in science led him to study at the Lycee Janson de Sailly and eventually make groundbreaking discoveries in the field of physics. His work on wave-particle duality earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1929, and his legacy continues to influence the study of quantum mechanics today.
