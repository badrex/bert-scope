tldr: The author calculates Penrose's quasi-local mass for various two-surfaces in different space-times, such as spherically symmetric surfaces in spherically symmetric space-time, and compares it with other mass definitions like Hawking's and Komar's. The study aims to understand the flux of mass, momentum, and angular momentum threading through two-surfaces in curved space-time using Penrose's construction.
