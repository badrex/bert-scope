tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the velocity of reaction in the absorption of specific agglutinins by bacteria and the adsorption of agglutinins, trypsin, and sulphuric acid by animal charcoal. They found that the reaction velocity in the absorption of agglutinins by bacteria was extremely fast, while the adsorption process took a longer time to reach equilibrium. This study aimed to understand the differences between these processes and their implications in the interaction between specific agglutinins and bacteria.
