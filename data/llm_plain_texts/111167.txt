tldr: "The author, T. Wharton Jones, discovered that the veins in a bat's wing have rhythmic contractility and valves. These veins contract and dilate rhythmically, with an average of ten contractions per minute. The valves help prevent the regurgitation of blood, and the contraction of the veins accelerates blood flow. The veins and arteries in the bat's wing do not directly communicate, and their structure is different from each other. The author also found that the veins' contractility is different from the arteries' contractility, being rhythmic rather than tonic."
