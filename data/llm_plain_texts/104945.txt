tldr: In this letter, Benjamin Franklin shares his experiments and observations on lightning and its effects on buildings. He explains how pointed rods can prevent or conduct lightning, protecting buildings from damage. He also describes a real-life example of lightning striking a church steeple, where the lightning was conducted through a small wire and a clock pendulum without damaging the building.
