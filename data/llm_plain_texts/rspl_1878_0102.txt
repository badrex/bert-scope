tldr: This article investigates the residual torsional strain in a glass fiber after being released from twisting stress. The author, J. Hopkinson, examines the after-effects of stress and the principle of superposition in glass fibers. The findings contribute to the understanding of the mechanical properties of glass and its applications.
