tldr: This study investigates the stress analysis of an elastic half-space with a finite open cylindrical cavity subjected to torsional shear tractions. The authors formulate a boundary value problem and reduce it to a generalized Cauchy singular integral equation. They present the fundamental solution for a torsional ring load acting on the cavity's sidewall and examine the resulting load-induced and shape-induced singularities in the response.
