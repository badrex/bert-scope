tldr: This article presents the experimental measurement of absolute gf-values for nine resonance lines of neutral scandium using the atomic-beam method. The authors discuss the challenges they faced during the experiment and compare their results with other determinations of absolute gf-values for Sc I. The findings can be used to put more extensive measurements of relative gf-values on an absolute scale.
