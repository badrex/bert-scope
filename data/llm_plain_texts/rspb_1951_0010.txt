tldr: The authors present a method to break down a person's body weight into extracellular fluid, cell mass, and fat, which can be applied to various physiological and medical problems. They investigate the composition of normal and obese individuals and demonstrate the effects of rehabilitation on undernourished individuals. This method can help solve nutritional, physiological, and medical issues.
