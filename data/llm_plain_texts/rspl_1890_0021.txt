tldr: The author investigated the position and function of the vocal cords during quiet respiration in humans. They discovered that the larynx plays an active role in respiration and that the vocal cords are wider open during quiet respiration than after death. The study found that the abductor muscles of the vocal cords are in a state of semi-tonic contraction, which is likely of a reflex character, and that these impulses act mainly through the pneumogastric nerves.
