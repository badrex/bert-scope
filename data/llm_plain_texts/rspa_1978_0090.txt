tldr: The author examines the near-field optical caustics formed by light passing through small liquid drops. They use catastrophe theory to analyze the interactions of caustic curves and discover that the main feature is a unique plane of focus containing several elliptic umbilic catastrophes. These catastrophes interact and unfold, creating the complex caustic patterns observed near the liquid drop.
