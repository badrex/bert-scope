tldr: This study investigates the genetic structure and color variation in southern peripheral populations of the snail Cepaea nemoralis. The research finds that yellow shells are at a high frequency throughout the surveyed region, while pink shells are more common in the central part. The distribution of genes controlling shell banding also shows differences compared to British populations. The findings suggest that microclimate may play a role in affecting local differentiations in shell color morph frequency.
