tldr: 'The article discusses the development of efficient transformation protocols to modify the plastid genome in tobacco plants. The authors describe the use of spectinomycin resistance as a selection marker and the insertion of foreign genes into the plastid genome through targeting in vitro. These advancements facilitate the study of plastid gene regulation and the application of genetic engineering to crop improvement.'
