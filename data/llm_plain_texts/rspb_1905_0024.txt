tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the effect of carbon dioxide on the geotropic curvature of pea plant roots. They found that carbon dioxide stimulates the roots to bend more quickly when exposed to it for 20 minutes. The study also showed that the optimal partial pressure of carbon dioxide for geotropic response is between 1% and 3%.
