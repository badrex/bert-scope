tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments using a new spectroscope with three prisms to measure the displacement of the solar spectrum due to changes in temperature. They found that the displacement was greater for bright lines than dark lines, with a mean value of 11.8 divisions for bright lines and 7.1 divisions for dark lines.'
