tldr: The author discusses various theories about the shape of the Earth and the effect of gravity on pendulum observations. They argue against the idea of an oblong spheroidal Earth and provide mathematical demonstrations to support their position. The author also addresses the implications of these findings on the understanding of Earth's shape and the behavior of fluids on its surface.
