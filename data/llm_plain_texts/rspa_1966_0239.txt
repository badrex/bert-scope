tldr: The authors present a new method for determining activity coefficients and second virial coefficients of mixtures using gas-liquid chromatography. They reformulate the differential equation describing the elution process and develop a new retention volume extrapolation procedure. This method allows for accurate determination of these coefficients, even when the carrier gas deviates from ideality. The authors support their method with data obtained through numerical integration and compare it to previously published procedures, showing that their method is more successful in recovering the originally specified values.
