tldr: The author investigates plane water-lines, curves described by particles of liquid flowing past a solid body, and their applications in ship design. They explore various types of water-lines, including those generated by cylinders and spheres, and introduce a new class of water-lines characterized by oval shapes. These water-lines closely resemble successful ship designs and can be easily constructed using ruler and compasses. The author also discusses the relationship between the form and dimensions of a ship's bow, maximum speed, and resistance in water.
