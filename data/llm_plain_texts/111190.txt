tldr: The author, George G. Stokes, discovered that the refrangibility of light can change when passing through certain solutions, like a weak solution of sulphate of quinine. This phenomenon, called internal dispersion, occurs in various vegetable solutions and can be observed in fluids like horse-chestnut bark, Datura stramonium seeds, turmeric, and madder. Stokes also identified that the dispersed light is not homogeneous, but rather a mix of rays with different refrangibilities.
