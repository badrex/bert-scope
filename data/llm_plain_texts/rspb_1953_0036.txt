tldr: The authors conducted phase contrast and electron microscopic studies on the nuclear apparatus of Escherichia coli, observing changes in bacterial nuclei with the age of the culture. They found that the contrast difference between the cytoplasmic and nuclear sites is maximum in bacteria of 1 to 2 hours growth, gradually diminishing with age. Electron micrographs show depressions at nuclear sites, which the authors believe are present at the nucleus sites. These findings provide insights into the changes in bacterial nuclei during different growth stages.
