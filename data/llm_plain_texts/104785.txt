tldr: Dr. Miles shares his experiment about the electricity of water. He found that water can be a medium for the transmission of effluvia, and that it can conduct electricity. The experiment involved a basin of water, a tube, and a spirit, and showed that the tube received electricity even when it didn't touch the water directly.
