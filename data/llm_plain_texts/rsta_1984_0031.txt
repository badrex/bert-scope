tldr: This article discusses the interactions between clay minerals and organic materials, focusing on intercalation, adsorption, and cation exchange. It explores the basic principles of intercalation reactions with kaolinite and the interaction of neutral organic compounds with mica-type layer silicates. The article also highlights various practical applications of clay-organic interactions, such as the use of urea for preparing thin-walled porcelain and the increased dry strength of urea-treated kaolins.
