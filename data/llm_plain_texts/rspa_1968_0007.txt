tldr: The authors studied the reactions of atomic oxygen with phosphorus and phosphine using a discharge flow system. They observed chemiluminescence in both reactions and attributed the visible and ultraviolet emissions to the processes involving phosphorus monoxide (PO) and diphosphorus dioxide (P2O2). The study also discussed bond energies of these species and the mechanisms of formation of excited PO. The results suggest that phosphorus and PO play minor roles in the reactions between atomic oxygen and phosphorus or phosphine.
