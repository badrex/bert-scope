tldr: The author evaluates the stability of taxonomic names, specifically focusing on crown-clade definitions. They argue that all phylogenetic definitions of taxon names, including crown-clade definitions, are equally stable in meaning, as the specified ancestor and the boundaries of the clad will remain the same regardless of changes in phylogenetic hypotheses. The author also finds that crown-clades are not more stable in content or highly corroborated compared to more-inclusive clades, due to uncertainties in the position of certain fossil forms. Therefore, there is no compelling reason to radically redefine familiar taxon names to apply to crown-clades.
