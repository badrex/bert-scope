tldr: This article investigates the effects of precession and nutation on the hypothesis of the Earth's interior being a heterogeneous fluid mass. The author extends the investigation to consider both the interior fluid and exterior shell as heterogeneous. They analyze the forces acting on the internal fluid of the Earth and determine the angular motion of the fluid about the axis of rotation. The study concludes that the angular motion of the fluid will be the same, to the required degree of approximation, whether the Earth is heterogeneous or homogeneous.
