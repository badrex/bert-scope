tldr: The author successfully extracted 26 kilograms of metallic tellurium from 321 tons of mineral containing an average of 22.5% bismuth. The tellurium was obtained by treating the alkaline residues from refining crude bismuth. The author also studied the properties of the extracted tellurium, including its crystal structure, specific gravity, and electrical resistance.
