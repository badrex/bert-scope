tldr: This article discusses the life and work of William Croone, a 17th-century physician and Fellow of the Royal Society. Croone made significant contributions to the understanding of living structures and processes, as well as experimental physics. His most notable discovery was that water has a maximum density above its freezing point. He also investigated the compressibility and density of air, the freezing of saltwater, wire breaking, and phosphorescence. Croone's work demonstrates his wide-ranging interests in science and medicine, and his efforts to apply physical experience to the better understanding of living processes.
