tldr: The FNR protein in Escherichia coli is a transcriptional regulator that activates or represses various genes in response to anoxia. The protein contains an iron-binding domain and is essential for the regulation of anaerobic functions. The study provides evidence that FNR is an iron-binding protein, with iron binding involving the N-terminal cysteine cluster.
