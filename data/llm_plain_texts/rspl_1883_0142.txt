tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the vapour-pressures of ice and steam. They found that the ice-steam curve, recalculated using Professor James Thomson's method, agreed more closely with their observations than the curve deduced from Regnault's formula E. The author also discussed the new method of ascertaining the vapour-pressures of solids and liquids, highlighting its advantages.
