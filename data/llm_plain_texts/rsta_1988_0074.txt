tldr: This article discusses the importance of chemical evidence in understanding the origin of the Solar System. It explores the role of interstellar dust clouds, the processes of planetary formation, and the differences between major planets and terrestrial ones. The author also highlights the need to study the surfaces of planets and satellites to understand the final stages of planetary formation and the search for diagnostic evidence of early large bodies in the Solar System.
