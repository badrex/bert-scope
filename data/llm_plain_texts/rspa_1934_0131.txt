tldr: 'This article presents a study of the spectrum of selenium, revealing new energy levels and enhanced lines in the neutral atom and doubly-ionized atom. The researchers used various discharge methods and identified about 50 lines for Se I and 40 lines for Se VII. The findings contribute to the understanding of selenium's atomic structure and its place in the periodic table.'
