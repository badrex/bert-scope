tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the mass of a cubic inch of distilled water using gravimeters of different forms. They also investigated the effects of temperature expansion on the density of water and the accuracy of measurement standards. The results provide a more accurate value for the mass of a cubic inch of distilled water in terms of the present imperial pound.
