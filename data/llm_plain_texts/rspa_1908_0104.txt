tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the occlusion of residual gas and fluorescence in the glass walls of Crookes tubes. They found that gas is driven mechanically into the glass, and the gas travels further into the glass when heated. The author also discovered that the gas travels only as far as cathode rays can penetrate aluminum, suggesting that mechanical force plays a significant role in the process. Diffusion may also contribute to the final result when the glass is softened in a flame.
