tldr: This article investigates the factors affecting the activation of phospholipase C in human platelets. It explores how prior exposure to phorbol esters, which stimulate protein kinase, inhibits the activation of phospholipase in response to various receptor-directed agonists. The study examines the role of protein kinase in platelet function and suggests that it plays a critical role in regulating phospholipase C activation.
