tldr: The authors determined the individual equilibrium constants of the four intermediate reactions between oxygen and sheep haemoglobin using a specially accurate gasometric technique. They found that the new and more accurate data on the dissociation curve are incompatible with previous theories, and the higher value of one constant has implications for the kinetic aspects of the reactions. The study provides a basis for understanding the interactions of haemoglobin's four iron atoms in oxygen and carbon monoxide reactions.
