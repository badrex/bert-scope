tldr: 'The study found that carnitine and glycerylphosphorylcholine, two substances found in mammalian epididymis, are also present in the spermatophores of the octopus. These substances were found in higher concentrations in the spermatophoric plasma and spermatozoa, indicating a possible role in sperm maturation and storage. This discovery highlights the similarities between sperm-storage organs, such as the mammalian epididymis and the cephalopod spermatophore.'
