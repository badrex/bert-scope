tldr: This article explores the calculation of the Legendre transformation of the beak-to-beak form of the parabolic umbilic, which is a mathematical concept that can be applied to the study of atmospheric fronts in meteorology. The authors demonstrate how a front can be regarded as a self-intersection line terminating at a swallowtail point on the Legendre transform surface, and how this idea can help improve our understanding of atmospheric fronts in semigeostrophic theory.
