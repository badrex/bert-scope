tldr: The author, George Biddell Airy, examined discrepancies between observed solar right ascensions at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, and Delambre's solar tables used in the Nautical Almanac. The study led to the discovery of errors in the masses of Venus, Mars, and the Moon, as well as the need for corrections in the epochs of the sun's longitude and the longitude of the perigee.
