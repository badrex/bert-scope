tldr: This article discusses the evolution and design of animal signalling systems in butterflies, focusing on visual and chemical signalling. It explores the functions of these signals, such as protection against predators and intraspecific communication. The article highlights the importance of understanding the significance of colours and scents in butterfly communication and suggests that a more complete understanding of butterfly signalling systems will require further research in various areas, including genetics, receptor physiology, and cladistic analysis of different butterfly groups.
