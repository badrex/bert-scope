tldr: The author, William Huggins, developed a registering spectroscope that allowed for the instant registration of positions of lines in the spectrum without removing the eye from the instrument. This innovation proved useful for observing the solar eclipse and analyzing spectra of different substances. The spectroscope used a compound prism that provided a dispersion equal to about two prisms of dense glass with a refracting angle of 60Â°.
