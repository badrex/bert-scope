tldr: The author, George Pearson, investigates the properties and varieties of expectorated matter secreted by the bronchial membrane. He categorizes the matter into seven types and discusses its role in various lung diseases, particularly pulmonary tubercles, which cause thousands of deaths in the United Kingdom annually. Pearson also examines the composition and characteristics of expectorated matter, including its appearance, taste, and smell, and its potential for medical research and diagnosis.
