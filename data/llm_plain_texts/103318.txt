tldr: In 1717, Edm. Halley observed a small telescopical comet and concluded that the returns of comets are more frequent than commonly believed. He also noted that there may be many more invisible celestial bodies due to their small size and distance. Halley's observation of this comet led him to suspect it might have some motion, which he further investigated with the help of fixed stars.
