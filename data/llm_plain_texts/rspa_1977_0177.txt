tldr: The authors study a class of finite groups with two generators and two relations, which is relevant to the study of trivalent-symmetric graphs and adds infinite families to the known class of finite groups with two-generator two-relation presentations. They explore various subclasses, their properties, and isomorphisms between the groups.
