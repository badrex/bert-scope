tldr: The authors present a mathematical study of the drafting process in wool textile production, focusing on the dynamics of fiber motion and the effect of relevant factors on the irregularity of the yarn produced. They develop equations to govern the drafting of a simplified model of a wool sliver and analyze the changes in thickness variations, relating them to the properties of the sliver and the drafting mechanism.
