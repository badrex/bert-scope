tldr: This article presents a new method for studying electron-hydrogen atom scattering using a variational principle. The authors solve a set of coupled differential equations to calculate scattering phase shifts and partial inelastic cross-sections. The results show that the method is more accurate than the close-coupling approximation and converges satisfactorily. The method's effectiveness in dealing with inelastic cross-sections is also examined.
