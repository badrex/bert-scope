tldr: The authors studied the efficiency of soft X-ray production and absorption in metals. They found that the number of photoelectrons produced from metals by soft X-rays is relatively small, and a large portion of the energy of the bombarding electrons appears as energy of secondary electrons. The authors also estimated the number of radiation quanta emitted from the X-ray tube for each bombarding electron, concluding that only one out of 10^5 or 10^6 electrons can produce a radiation quantum escaping from the anode.
