tldr: The authors apply the relaxation method to solve engineering problems related to elastic stability and vibrations. They focus on calculating critical loads and natural frequencies of a straight rod with non-uniform mass and flexural rigidity. The relaxation method is a powerful tool for determining critical loads and the corresponding modes of distortion for struts of non-uniform section.
