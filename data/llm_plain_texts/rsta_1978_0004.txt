tldr: This article presents the constitutive equations of continuum creep damage mechanics, which describe the macroscopic behavior of metals under multiaxial stress states. The concept of an internal state parameter, called the damage parameter, is introduced to account for the physical damage in materials. The equations are used to predict the characteristics of load-bearing components operating at high temperatures, focusing on the reference rupture stress and the isochronous rupture surface as key material properties.
