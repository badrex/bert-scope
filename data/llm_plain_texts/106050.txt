tldr: The author, Thomas Ronayne, shares his observations on atmospheric electricity, particularly in relation to fogs, mists, and auroras. He describes experiments using an electrometer and discusses the behavior of electricity in the air during different weather conditions. He also touches upon the possibility of negative electricity at the antipodes and the role of moisture in retaining electricity in foggy conditions.
