tldr: This study compares the records from British magnetic stations, both underground and surface, to understand how data from a southeastern England observatory applies to the British coalfields. The research focuses on the regular diurnal inequalities and irregular short-period changes in declination and horizontal force. The findings suggest that in a coal mine with minimal local disturbance, declination changes may be treated as identical to those at the surface for practical purposes.
