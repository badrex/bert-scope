tldr: 'The author, John Goldingham, observed and recorded the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites using achromatic telescopes. He discussed the importance of accurate telescopes and timekeeping for these observations, as well as the need for correspondent observations from different locations to determine the correct difference in longitude. The author also shared his experience with two telescopes of seemingly equal power but with noticeable differences in performance.'
