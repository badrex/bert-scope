tldr: The author examines the development of branchial arterial arches in birds, specifically focusing on the origin of the subclavian and carotid arteries. They argue that the theories commonly accepted for mammalian and reptilian embryology do not apply to birds. The author provides detailed descriptions of the arterial system in birds, including the common carotid, subclavian, and vertebral arteries, and discusses the differences between bird and mammal arterial development.
