tldr: This article discusses the properties of caustics, focusing on the case of parallel rays refracted at a circle. The author presents a mathematical analysis of the secondary caustic curve, which is a curve of the order 8. The article also explores the case of reflection, where the curve degenerates into a curve of the order 6, and proposes further study of this sextic curve.
