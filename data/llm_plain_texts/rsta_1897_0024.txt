tldr: The author discusses the correlation of meteorological phenomena and the limitations of correlation coefficients. They also propose a frequency-registering barometer to simplify the process of constructing a frequency curve. The author suggests that increasing the time interval and varying the direction between stations can affect the correlation coefficient.
