tldr: The author discusses the possibility of rain and snow-water being sufficient to make fountains and rivers run perpetually. They analyze the River Seine and estimate the amount of water needed to maintain its flow, concluding that only a small portion of the rainwater is necessary for this purpose. This study suggests that rain and snow-water can support the flow of rivers in proportion to their needs.
