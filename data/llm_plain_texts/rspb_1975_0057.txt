  - Environmental Degradation
tldr: This article discusses the presence and environmental behaviors of synthetic organohalides, such as DDT and PCBs, in the sea. It highlights their persistence in the environment, potential impacts on living organisms, and the need for continued research on these compounds and other similar pollutants. The article also addresses the shift in usage of these chemicals from the Northern Hemisphere to the Southern Hemisphere and the increasing concern for other synthetic halogenated hydrocarbons like hexachlorobenzene.
