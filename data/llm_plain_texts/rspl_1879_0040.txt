tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the oxidation of oxalic acid and alkali oxalates by sunlight. They found that while oxalic acid is entirely destroyed by sunlight, alkali oxalates do not entirely escape the oxidizing action of sunlight. The authors also investigated the decomposition of potassium iodide in sunlight and suggested that the oxidation of the alkali metal is responsible for the phenomenon. Further research is needed to understand the exact process of oxidation in these compounds.
