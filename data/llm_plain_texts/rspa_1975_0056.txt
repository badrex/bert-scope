revised_title: 'Dirac's Large Numbers Theory and the Effect on Rock Structures'
semantic_tags:

tldr: The author explores Dirac's Large Numbers Theory and its implications on the structure of rocks. They suggest that new interstitial atoms, created in accordance with the theory, diffuse to sinks like dislocations, leading to an increase in the dislocation density of rocks over time. This could potentially be detected by examining rocks of different ages in an electron microscope.
