  - Skin
  - Water absorption
  - Gas exchange
tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the osmotic passage of water and gases through human skin. They found that water passes through the skin via an osmotic process, while gas exchange is influenced by the concentration of salt solutions. This research provides insights into the regulation of body temperature and the role of the skin in maintaining homeostasis.
