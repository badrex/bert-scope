tldr: The authors conducted experiments on a cat to study the rhythmic discharge of motoneurons. They discovered that a rhythmic reflex discharge is set up by a corresponding rhythmic activity central to the axon hillock of a motoneuron. By using antidromic impulses, they found that the shorter the curtailed cycle, the longer the subsequent cycle. This research provides insights into the underlying mechanisms of the rhythmic discharge of motoneurons and their relation to reflex activity.
