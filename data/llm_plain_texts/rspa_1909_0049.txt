tldr: This article discusses the theory of tidal oscillations on a rotating globe, focusing on the influence of the Earth's rotation on tidal problems. The author presents mathematical models for free vibrations of a plane rectangular sheet of liquid and an ocean bounded by two meridians, considering the effects of the Earth's rotation. The study aims to provide a better understanding of tidal prediction and the behavior of oceanic waters.
