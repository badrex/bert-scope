tldr: This article discusses the role of the Pomeranchuk singularity within the duality scheme for strong interaction scattering amplitudes. It explores the implications of this idea and raises some unsolved problems related to the topic. The author also analyzes various processes and elastic scattering to test the conjecture on the nature of the pomeron.
