tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the volatility of platinum and palladium metals at high temperatures. They found that both metals lose weight when exposed to temperatures of 1300Â°C for two hours, with platinum losing more weight than palladium. This discovery challenges the widely accepted belief that metals of the platinum group do not sublimate at temperatures below their melting point.
