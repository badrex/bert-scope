tldr: This article presents the results of temperature gradient observations conducted on the West Coast of Scotland and at Oxshott, Surrey, using kite aerial photography. The authors found that the average decrease of temperature for the first 500 meters was 20.2°C, with the total decrease for 1,500 meters being 9.2°C, or 0.6°C per 100 meters. The study also discusses the challenges and methods of conducting such observations, as well as the weather conditions experienced during the research.
