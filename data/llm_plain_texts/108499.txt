tldr: The author, George Newport, conducted experiments on the impregnation of the ovum in amphibians, specifically frogs, and observed the penetration of spermatozoa into the egg. Using a glass cell and a cistern box, Newport detailed the process of sperm penetration and the subsequent formation of the embryo. This research provided valuable insights into the fertilization process and the early stages of development in amphibians.
