tldr: This study investigates the effect of surface and vessel size on the thermal decomposition of acetaldehyde. The researchers found that the reaction is not significantly influenced by a chain mechanism or heterogeneous reactions. The results confirm that the rate of pressure increase accurately measures the rate of acetaldehyde decomposition under the tested conditions.
