tldr: The authors discuss the concept of heterosis, or hybrid vigor, in seedling plants. They explore the relationship between heterosis and variability, and suggest that understanding the early stages of growth may reveal the mechanisms behind heterosis. They also mention the importance of germination timing and how it relates to climate variability and breeding systems in plants.
