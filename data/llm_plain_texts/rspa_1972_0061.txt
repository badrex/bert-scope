tldr: The authors measured the five single-crystal elastic constants of dysprosium and holmium within the temperature range of 4.2 to 300 K. They eliminated spurious contributions from domain reorientation effects by applying a magnetic field along the magnetically easy direction. The results indicate large magnetic contributions to the elastic constants, which can be interpreted as arising from the strain dependence of the exchange energy. This study helps in understanding the properties of heavy rare earth metals and their potential applications.
