tldr: The authors conducted research on the asparagus root to determine the nature of the proteid substance that forms the asparagine present in the young shoots of the plant. They discovered a single reserve proteid in the asparagus root that is soluble in distilled water, making it an albumin. The proteid has reactions with neutral salts that indicate a relationship to globulins, differentiating it from animal albumins.
