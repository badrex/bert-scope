tldr: Antony van Leeuwenhoek examines a hairy substance from a woman's stocking under a microscope and describes the various particles and fibers he observes. He concludes that the broken woolly particles likely come from the heel of the stocking, and that they could potentially be ingested accidentally. He also discusses his observations of cow gut membranes and bladder membranes.
