semantic_tags:
  - Quaternion algebra
  - Projective geometry
  - Linear transformations
  - Vector calculus
  - Duality principle
tldr: This article explores the use of quaternions in projective geometry, focusing on their applications in linear transformations, vector calculus, and the duality principle. The author demonstrates how quaternions can represent points and planes, and discusses various notations and interpretations of quaternion arrays. The article also covers the geometric character of transformations and the role of quaternions in inversion functions.
