tldr: The study investigates the behavioral correlates of activity in the giant cerebral neurons of the nudibranch mollusk Archidoris. Intracellular recordings were made from the neurons in isolated brain and whole animal preparations. The neurons responded to shadowing stimuli and tactile or chemical stimulation of the body surface. Both neurons showed different modes of firing associated with spontaneous movements of the mantle, spontaneous and reflex gill withdrawal, and closure of the mantle over the retracted gill. The findings suggest a behavioral role for these neurons in the nudibranch's responses to sensory input and environmental stimuli.
