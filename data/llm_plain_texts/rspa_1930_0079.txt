tldr: The authors investigate the photo-conductance phenomenon in silver halides, specifically silver bromide, to understand its connection to the photographic process. They find that the primary photo-chemical process in silver halides is intimately connected to the photo-conductance effect, and that this effect can be used to study the mechanism of latent image formation under conditions similar to those used in photography.
