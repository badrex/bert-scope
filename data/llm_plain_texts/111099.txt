tldr: The author, Richard Edmonds, describes various observations of extraordinary oscillations of the sea and their possible connection to submarine shocks of the earth caused by electrical discharges between the earth and the atmosphere or between oppositely electrified portions of the earth. These oscillations were observed in Mount's Bay, Plymouth Sound, and other locations.
