tldr: This article investigates the relationship between viscosity, elasticity, and plastic strength in flour dough. The authors study the dough's mechanical properties, such as elastic after-effect and hysteresis, and find that these properties are essential for understanding the dough's behavior. They also discuss the challenges in measuring these properties and propose a method to obtain more accurate values for the relaxation time and viscosity.
