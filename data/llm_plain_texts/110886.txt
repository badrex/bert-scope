tldr: The author, William Robert Grove, conducted experiments with a gas voltaic battery and various substances, including phosphorus, sulfur, and hydrocarbons. He discovered that these non-conductive solids could be made to generate a continuous voltaic current when placed in a gas battery. This allowed for the study of their electrochemical relations and introduced the use of the galvanometer as a test of vaporization. Grove also described a new form of gas battery that used a single piece of zinc to generate hydrogen, which charged an indefinite number of cells.
