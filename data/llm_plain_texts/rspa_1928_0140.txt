tldr: The authors describe the calibration process of an infra-red spectrometer and the determination of refractive indices for rocksalt, fluorite, and quartz. They explain the importance of accurate calibration for precise measurements in the infra-red region and provide a detailed procedure for setting up the spectrometer and maintaining its sensitivity.
