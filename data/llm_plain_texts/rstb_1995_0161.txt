tldr: The article discusses the role of the SOX9 gene in autosomal sex reversal and campomelic dysplasia, a skeletal malformation syndrome. The authors found that mutations in the SOX9 gene are linked to both bone formation and control of testis development. This discovery helps to understand the complex genetic interactions involved in sex determination and the development of testes in mammals.
