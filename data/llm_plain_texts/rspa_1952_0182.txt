tldr: The authors determined the densities of unsaturated vapours of ethyl ether, carbon disulphide, carbon tetrachloride, perfluoromethylcyclohexane, and acetone at 22°C using a method that compares their densities with oxygen. They found that these vapours' deviations from ideality with pressure were linear, and their molecular weights agreed with standard values. This study shows that accurate molecular weight measurements can be made at lower pressures than before, expanding the use of the limiting density principle.
