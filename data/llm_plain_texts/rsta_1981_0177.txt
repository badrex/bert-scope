tldr: This article explores the classification of cubic functions on a nonsingular curve, focusing on their singularities and the relationship between these singularities and the Hessian surface. The author investigates the equisingularity class of the pair and the number and multiplicity of critical points of the function. The study of these functions and their singularities has implications for understanding the canonical stratification of mathematical spaces.
