tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the relationship between the surface energy of liquids and temperature. They discovered that a similar formula to the gaseous equation can express the variation of surface energy with temperature. The study focused on "normal" liquids, such as ether, methyl formate, ethyl acetate, carbon tetrachloride, benzene, and chlorobenzene, and found that the linear relation between molecular surface energy and temperature holds for these liquids within specific temperature ranges.
