tldr: The authors describe the crystal structure of horse met-myoglobin, focusing on the arrangement of polypeptide chains. They found that the protein crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P2₁ with two molecules in general positions in the unit cell. The study provides insights into the similarities and differences between myoglobin and hemoglobin structures, as well as the arrangement of polypeptide chains in the myoglobin molecule.
