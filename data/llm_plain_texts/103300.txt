tldr: The author, Mr. St. Andre, discusses the peristaltic and antiperistaltic motions of the intestines and their effects on the body. He presents a case study of a patient with a violent contraction of the abdominal muscles, leading to a rupture of the diaphragm and other complications. This case supports the idea that the antiperistaltic motion is not a natural occurrence in the digestive system.
