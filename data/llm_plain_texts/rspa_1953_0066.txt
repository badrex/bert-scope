tldr: The author presents a new method to approach non-linear differential equations of the second order in mechanics, using the topology of integral curves of a first-order differential equation. This method provides qualitative information that can guide numerical calculations of the solutions. The author discusses reducible non-linear equations, including Emden's equation, which is important in astrophysics, and Blasius' equation, which is relevant to boundary-layer theory.
