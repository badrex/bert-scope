revised_title: 'Asymptotic Boundary Shape for Interacting Substances in Sedimentation and Electrophoresis'
semantic_tags:
  - Chemical Interactions
  - Sedimentation
  - Electrophoresis
  - Boundary Shape
  - Asymptotic Analysis
tldr: The authors study the effects of interaction between substances in sedimentation and electrophoresis, focusing on the asymptotic boundary shape. They develop a method to analyze the patterns formed by interacting substances, which can provide valuable information about the interactions between molecules in solution.
