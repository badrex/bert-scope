tldr: The authors conducted experiments to observe the Golgi apparatus in living cells of Helix, a type of snail. They discovered that the Golgi apparatus, which was previously doubted to exist in living cells, can be observed and stained using specific techniques. The authors also discussed the differences in the appearance and behavior of the Golgi apparatus in both vertebrate and invertebrate cells, and provided detailed descriptions of their observations and methods.
