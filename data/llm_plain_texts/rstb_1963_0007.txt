tldr: 'This study examines the ultrastructure of nucleoli and chromosomes during the early stages of liver regeneration and the changes caused by X radiation. The researchers found that nucleoli undergo significant changes in size and structure during the regeneration process. X radiation exposure led to chromosome fragmentation and alterations in nucleoli just before mitosis. The findings provide insights into the effects of radiation on cellular structures and the process of liver regeneration.'
