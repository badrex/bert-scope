tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the interaction between chloroform and proteins in solutions. They found that chloroform forms an unstable compound with proteins, which affects cell activity and leads to anaesthesia. This discovery helps explain how anaesthetics work on different types of cells and contributes to the understanding of anaesthesia's biochemical nature.
