tldr: The authors studied the thermal degradation of methyl methacrylate copolymers with glycol dimethacrylate and acrylonitrile. They found that cross-links in the polymer chains did not affect the degradation rate. The degradation process of these copolymers was different from that of pure polymethyl methacrylate chains. The authors also investigated the effect of introducing foreign monomer molecules into the polymer chains, focusing on the methyl methacrylate-acrylonitrile copolymer system.
