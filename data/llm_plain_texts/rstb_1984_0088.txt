tldr: This article provides an introduction to the complement system, a complex biochemical and genetic system that plays a crucial role in humoral immunity. The complement system has two pathways of activation, the classical and alternative pathways, which involve a series of proteolytic zymogens that convert to active proteases and form a lytic complex capable of lysing bacterial and animal cells. The article discusses the biochemistry, genetics, and medical importance of the complement system, including its connection to autoimmune diseases and the major histocompatibility complex.
