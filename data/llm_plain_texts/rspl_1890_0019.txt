tldr: The author conducted experiments with Lord Rayleigh's color box to study color perception and vision in various individuals. They found that different people perceive colors differently, with some showing large discrepancies in their color vision. The author also discovered that the color box's artificial yellow appeared consistent across observers, but the ratios of red to green varied significantly among individuals.
