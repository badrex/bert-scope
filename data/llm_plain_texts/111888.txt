tldr: The author examines Dalton's hypothesis about an independent aqueous vapour atmosphere and finds it incompatible with observed facts and known laws of temperature decrease. The study concludes that the observed tensions at the surface are not dependent on or balanced by the pressure of vapour in the higher parts of the atmosphere, and that air offers resistance to the diffusion of vapour, contrary to the initial assumption.
