revised_title: 'The Impact of Peptone and Nucleic Acids on Blood Coagulation'
semantic_tags:
  - Blood coagulation
  - Peptone
  - Nucleic acids
  - Anti-coagulant action
  - Rodent pigmentation
tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of peptone and nucleic acids on blood coagulation in various animals. They found that peptone and nucleic acids can inhibit blood coagulation, and this effect is related to the animals' pigmentation. The study also suggests that variations in blood surface conditions may be responsible for the toxic effects of intravascular injections of heterologous blood.
