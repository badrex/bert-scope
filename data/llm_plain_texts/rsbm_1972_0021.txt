tldr: The article is a biographical memoir of Arthur Stoll, a significant figure in the Swiss chemical industry and a prominent collaborator with Richard Willstatter. Stoll made substantial contributions to the fields of chlorophyll chemistry, plant pigments, enzyme chemistry, and the pharmaceutical industry. His work focused on isolating pharmacologically active compounds from drugs in chemically pure forms, using mild methods and neutral solvent mixtures. Stoll's career transition from academia to the pharmaceutical industry highlights the importance of his work in both scientific research and industrial applications.
