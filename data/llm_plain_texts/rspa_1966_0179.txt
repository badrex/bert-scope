tldr: This article investigates the effects of compressibility on free convection boundary layers, providing a complete formulation and solutions that clarify the impact of various parameters. The study demonstrates that previous approaches to the free convection problem are limited and that an exact treatment will not produce'similar' velocity and temperature distributions. The analysis focuses on two-dimensional flow and isothermal vertical plates, considering the effects of compressibility, relative temperature difference, and the ratio of specific heats.
