tldr: The authors study the onset of molecular rotation on melting in stiff molecules, such as benzene derivatives and fused aromatic rings. They evaluate the fractional increase in volume on melting and compare it with the increase required for molecular rotation in the melt. The results show that in many melts containing stiff molecules, there can be no molecular rotation. The authors also discuss the behavior of molecules in melts and the experimental methods used to study these phenomena.
