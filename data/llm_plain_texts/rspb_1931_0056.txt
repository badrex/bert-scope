tldr: The author investigates the effects of homogeneous X-radiation on living tissues using a crystal diffraction method. They observed tissue reactions, including hypertrophy and atrophy, and found evidence of antagonism and selective action in the mouse skin. The study also explores the effects on sea anemones, tadpoles, and frogs, but no conclusive results were obtained.
