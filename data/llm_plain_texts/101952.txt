tldr: 'The author conducted experiments to examine the expansion and contraction of fluids, such as water, mercury, and spirit of wine, by heat and cold. The findings showed that different fluids respond differently to temperature changes, and the author proposed using spirit of wine as a basis for thermometer design. The experiments also highlighted the importance of considering the effects of temperature on barometers and the potential for using boiling point as a test for spirit strength.'
