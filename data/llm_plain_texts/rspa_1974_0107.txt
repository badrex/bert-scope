tldr: This study investigates the influence of solute depleted zones on the stress-corrosion susceptibility of aged Al-7.2% Mg and Al-4.4% Cu alloys. The research focuses on the electrochemical properties of the grain boundary precipitate, solute depleted zone, and matrix composition. The findings explain the distribution and kinetics of the corrosion reaction and stress-corrosion crack initiation in these alloys.
