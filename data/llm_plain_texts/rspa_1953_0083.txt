tldr: 'The authors investigated the flow of liquid helium II through compressed powder under various temperature and pressure gradients. They found that the flow rate, heat current, and pressures at different points were dependent on the pressure difference. The flow was observed to be pressure-dependent and turbulent in nature, with the flow rate increasing as the pressure difference increased. The results showed a significant difference in behavior compared to flow through smooth channels, indicating that the flow through compressed powder is not frictionless.'
