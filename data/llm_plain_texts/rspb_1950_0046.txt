tldr: Researchers at the National Institute for Medical Research synthesized 87 compounds from two 4-chloroquinolines to find an amoebicidal agent that could replace emetine. They discovered several compounds with in vitro activity on Entamoeba histolytica, a parasite responsible for amoebic infections. The study aimed to establish a reliable biological test for amoebicidal activity and explore potential alternatives to emetine for treating amoebiasis.
