tldr: The article describes the discovery of a new malaria parasite, Plasmodium odocoilei, in the white-tailed deer. The parasite is unique in its large vacuoles, distorted infected red blood cells, and its presence in the New World. The authors discuss the parasite's phylogeny and its relation to the vertebrate host, suggesting that the deer may have carried a plasmodial infection that was the common source of malaria in the Old World Tragulidae and the New World Odocoileus.
