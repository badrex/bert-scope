tldr: The authors conducted high-resolution studies of electron excitation in the 3D and 4D states of helium. They observed a series of broad and sharp features in the excitation functions and discussed their interpretation, suggesting that some features are shape resonances, while others are Feshbach resonances. The results provide insights into the behavior of electrons in helium and contribute to the understanding of atomic and molecular processes.
