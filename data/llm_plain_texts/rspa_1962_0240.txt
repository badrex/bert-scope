tldr: The author presents a unified field theory that combines gravitation and electromagnetism. The theory is based on a symmetric metric tensor and a symmetric affine connection. The new theory modifies the Born-Infeld theory, eliminating the symmetry between electrostatics and magnetostatics and preventing the existence of magnetic poles. The field equations derived from the action function provide a model for charged particles with finite self-energy and contribute to their gravitational mass.
