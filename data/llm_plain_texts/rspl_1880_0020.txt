tldr: The author conducted research on the color pigments found in human urine, specifically normal urobilin and febrile urobilin. They discovered that normal urobilin is identical to choletelin and is produced by oxidation from bilirubin. Febrile urobilin, on the other hand, can be produced by reduction of choletelin, normal urobilin, and a similar body produced by oxidation of hsematoin. The author also found that the chromogen of febrile urobilin exists in normal urine.
