tldr: The author conducted experiments with gelatinizing solutions to study the forms and shapes of drops and vortices. They discovered that the shapes of these formations can be influenced by factors such as temperature, density, and the type of coagulating solution used. The results provide insights into the complex interactions between liquid dynamics and the formation of organic shapes in nature.
