  - Muscle Contraction
  - Striated Muscle
tldr: The authors studied the mechanical properties of a beetle flight muscle and found that it has a unique ability to perform rhythmical contractions independent of the stimulus frequency. They discovered that the muscle's performance is influenced by the physical characteristics of the load, and they discussed the differences between this muscle and other striated muscles.
