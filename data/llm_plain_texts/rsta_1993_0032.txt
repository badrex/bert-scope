tldr: The authors present an analytical solution for the flow of incompressible viscous fluid in curved pipes, focusing on circular pipes of elliptical cross-section. They provide detailed calculations for pipes of circular cross-section, including friction loss factors and velocity contours. The results show favorable agreements with existing experimental data and recent numerical solutions based on the Navier-Stokes equations.
