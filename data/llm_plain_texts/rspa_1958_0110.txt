tldr: The authors conducted experiments using Raman spectroscopy to study the relative intensities of the totally symmetrical vibrations in the vapour state of tetramethyls of carbon, silicon, germanium, tin, and lead. They found that the intensity of a specific mode, consisting mainly of symmetrical methyl deformation, increases as the central carbon atom is replaced by other elements in the periodic table. This observation supports Wolkenstein's assumption that the polarizability of a bond is not affected by changes in orientation.
