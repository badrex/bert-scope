tldr: This study investigates the rest and movement of the small intestine in a dog with a fistula. The authors found that swallowing, food ingestion, and external stimuli like mental impressions, tickling, and cold application can cause contractions and peristalsis in the small intestine. Food intake increases the regularity and force of contractions, while exercise and mechanical irritation also promote effective peristalsis.
