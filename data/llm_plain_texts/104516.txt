tldr: Astronomer James Bradley observed an apparent motion in some fixed stars and conducted a series of observations over 20 years to understand the cause. He discovered that the stars appeared to move due to the Earth's movement and the finite speed of light. This finding helped improve the accuracy of astronomical observations and contributed to the understanding of celestial mechanics.
