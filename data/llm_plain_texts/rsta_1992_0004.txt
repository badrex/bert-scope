tldr: The authors investigate the adhesion of thermoplastic fiber composites, focusing on surface treatments and their effects on adhesive fracture energies. They find that a critical intensity of corona treatment prevents interfacial failure and that the locus of joint failure can be predicted using stress field analysis and interlaminar fracture stress measurements.
