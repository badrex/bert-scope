tldr: The author, T. Wharton Jones, critiques Dr. Martin Barry's recent papers on blood corpuscles in Philosophical Transactions. Jones argues that Barry has confused the colorless and red corpuscles, and he provides evidence to support his claims. He also explains that the appearance of flask-like vesicles in some red corpuscles is due to decomposition. If Barry's premises are deemed incorrect, Jones states that his entire reasoning will collapse.
