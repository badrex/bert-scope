tldr: The author, Edward J. Cooper, investigates the distribution of perihelia and nodes of the planets, including newly discovered asteroids. He found a remarkable coincidence between the distribution of these celestial bodies and the periods of their discovery. This study suggests that there may be an unexplored physical cause influencing these phenomena.
