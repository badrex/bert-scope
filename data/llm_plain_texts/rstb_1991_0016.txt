tldr: This article discusses the role of agrin, a protein found in the synaptic basal lamina, in the formation of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) aggregates and the development of neuromuscular junctions. Agrin is released from motor axon terminals and induces AChR aggregation, which is crucial for the formation of the post-synaptic apparatus at developing and regenerating neuromuscular junctions. The article also explores the mechanism of agrin-induced AChR aggregation and its role in the accumulation of other components of the post-synaptic apparatus.
