tldr: 'This Royal Society Discussion Meeting examined the total environmental impact of North Sea oil and gas developments. While neither the worst fears nor the best hopes have been realized, an accommodation has been reached with the fishing industry in the affected area. Offshore platforms are a source of chronic pollution from production water, and the use of oil-based drilling muds has increased, estimated to add 20 Mt per year of petroleum hydrocarbons to the sea. The effects of these additions have been studied in laboratory experiments, mesocosms, and field surveys, revealing a consistent picture of environmental impact. The total area affected is minimal in the context of the North Sea, with no evidence that plankton is materially affected, and seabird populations have not been affected by oil pollution.'
