tldr: The authors conducted experiments on Lupinus albus plants to study the effect of isolating a primordium on phyllotaxis. They found that the arrangement of leaves depends on factors such as contact between primordia and neighboring leaves, the ratio of the sizes of young leaves to the axis, and the value of the relative radius. These findings challenge existing theories on phyllotaxis and provide insights into plant development and leaf arrangement.
