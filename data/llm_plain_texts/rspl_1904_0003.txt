tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effect of a magnetic field on crystal formation and growth. They observed some orientation of crystals in a magnetic field, but could not conclusively determine if the orientation was due to magnetism or other factors. The author also experimented with the formation of magnetic compounds, such as iron sulfides and iron oxides, in a magnetic field.
