tldr: The authors conducted a molecular analysis of the 18S ribosomal RNA gene in Saccoglossus cambrensis, Arbacia sp., and Mytilus edulis to investigate deuterostome phylogeny. Their findings support the hypothesis that hemichordates are the sister group of chordates. This study provides insights into the evolutionary relationships between deuterostome phyla, such as chordates, hemichordates, and echinoderms.
