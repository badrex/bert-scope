tldr: The authors study the catalytic decomposition of isopropyl ether under the influence of various halides. They find that iodine, alkyl iodides, and hydrogen bromide act as catalysts, while alkyl chlorides have little to no effect. The reaction kinetics are analyzed, and the authors discover that the rate is nearly proportional to the concentration of the catalyst, and the time of half-change is independent of the ether concentration.
