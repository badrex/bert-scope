tldr: The authors calculated the effective conductivity of random suspensions of spherical particles using a Monte Carlo method and a method that includes both far- and near-field interactions. They found that the Clausius-Mosotti equation is reasonably accurate for conductivity ratios of 10 or less up to 60% volume fraction. The results are consistent with previous theoretical work and experimental data.
