tldr: 'This study investigates self-induced waves in a conduit with corrugated walls using water in an open horizontal channel. The experiments show that the wavelengths of the waves are multiples of the corrugation pitch, and the wave pattern remains consistent throughout the study. The findings suggest that in corrugated channels, the velocity depends only on the linear scale and gravity, and the wave heights are larger in the middle of the channel than at the ends.'
