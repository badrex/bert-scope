tldr: The author, Mr. Hamilton, explores the formation and transformation of volcanic rocks in the Solfaterra, an ancient volcano. He discovers that the variegated marbles found in the area are composed of calcined pumice and erupted matter, which have been acted upon by hot vapors. Hamilton also finds evidence of bitumen turning into pumice and pumice into marble, suggesting the difficulty in determining the primitive state of many natural productions. This study provides insights into the great changes the Earth undergoes and its probable antiquity.
