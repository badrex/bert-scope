tldr: The authors conducted experiments with copper ferrocyanide membranes to study their selective properties. They found that the membranes are composed of colloidal particles of copper ferrocyanide hydrate, which selectively adsorb water from sugar solutions. This selective adsorption is responsible for the membrane's permeability and osmotic flow. The results support the adsorption hypothesis and provide insights into the behavior of colloidal membranes.
