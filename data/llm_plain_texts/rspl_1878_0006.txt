tldr: The author examines the nervous system of Aurelia aurita, a type of sea anemone, and compares it to other medusae species. They describe the unique structure of the nervous system, including the presence of nerve fibers and bipolar nerve-cells, and discuss its similarities to the developing central nervous systems in vertebrate embryos. The study contributes to the understanding of the evolution and early development of the nervous system in animals.
