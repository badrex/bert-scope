tldr: This article presents a general sum rule that allows for the exact calculation of long-range forces between atoms using perturbation theory. The authors apply this method to the interaction between a proton and a hydrogen atom, providing a precise assessment of the significance of continuum states. The sum rule technique has potential applications in various fields.
