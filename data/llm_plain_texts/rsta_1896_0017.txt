tldr: The author investigates the distribution of electric and magnetic forces in electromagnetic systems moving through the ether. They analyze the motion of electrical point-charges and discuss the electric force due to a moving point-charge, as well as the distribution of magnetic force. The author also introduces the concept of the "Heaviside ellipsoid" and discusses the mathematical forms and principles used in the study of electromagnetism.
