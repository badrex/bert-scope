tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of electric discharge on the bactericillus coli communis. They found that electric discharge was toxic to the bacteria, and the toxic effect was not due to the direct action of the current but rather the products of the discharge, such as nitric and nitrous acids. This research suggests that electric treatment could be used to retard bacterial action in tissue attacked by pathological bacteria.
