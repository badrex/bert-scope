tldr: The authors study the vibrational properties of crystals with randomly arranged impurities, focusing on mass changes and force constants. They use a thermal Green function technique to calculate average and weighted displacement and momentum correlations, which can be related to observable properties like density of states, thermal energies, optical absorption, and neutron scattering. The method treats multiple interactions with a single defect correctly but only approximately handles interference between defects.
