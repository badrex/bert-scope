tldr: The author investigates higher harmonic resonances in free convection between vertical parallel plates, focusing on three different classes of resonance. They derive coupled amplitude equations for these cases and examine possible solutions and their stability using actual coefficients. This research helps to understand the behavior of solutions in real physical systems and the range of validity of the derived equations.
