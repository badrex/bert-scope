tldr: The author, B.C. Brodie, explores the dual function of alkaline peroxides in oxidation and reduction. They demonstrate that these peroxides can act as agents of both processes and explain how their catalytic decomposition can be seen as a combination of these actions. Brodie also provides examples of how intermediate compounds play a role in catalytic change, such as in the case of copper and peroxide reactions.
