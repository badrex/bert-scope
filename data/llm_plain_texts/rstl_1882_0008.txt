tldr: This paper studies the embryonic development and reproduction of the Lepidosteus fish. The authors describe the segmentation, formation of germinal layers, and general development of the embryo and larva. They also discuss the adult anatomy and compare the organs of Lepidosteus with those of other fish. The spawning process of Lepidosteus is observed in the wild, and the authors provide detailed descriptions of the eggs, their membranes, and the surrounding environment. The paper contributes to the understanding of fish development and ichthyology.
