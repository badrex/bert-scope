tldr: The authors investigated the phase transition in superconductors, focusing on the nucleation process and supercooling. They discovered that superconducting nuclei form at specific flaws in the metal, and the degree of supercooling depends on the nature of these flaws. The study provides insights into the interphase surface tension and the behavior of superconducting flaws, contributing to a better understanding of superconductivity.
