tldr: The author, Edward Frankland, explores the synthesis and properties of organometallic compounds, specifically stanethyl, stannic ethide, and stannic ethylomethide. These compounds consist of tin combined with organic radicals, and their formation and reactions are described in detail. The author also discusses the unsuccessful attempts to create mercuric ethylomethide.
