tldr: The authors conducted X-ray studies on the structure of hair and wool fibers, discovering that keratin, the main protein in these fibers, has two forms. One form is fully extended, while the other is shorter and folded. The elastic properties of hair and wool are based on this molecular mechanism. The study also reveals that the structure of keratin in hair and wool is similar to that of silk, which is made of fully-extended polypeptide chains.
