tldr: This article discusses the formation and properties of hydrocarbon gels, focusing on the two-phase structure and the role of solvent-polymer interactions. The authors explore the conditions required for gelation, such as the presence of polar contacts and the use of organic derivatives of aluminum salts. They also investigate the effects of moisture and the properties of monolayers of aluminum soaps on gelation.
