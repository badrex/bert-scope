tldr: The authors determined the cross-section for the photodisintegration of carbon into three alpha particles using a study of 2500 stars in nuclear emulsions. They found at least five resonances and a strong minimum in the cross-section, suggesting the formation of a well-defined compound nucleus. The integrated cross-section was found to be 0.5 mb for further 0.5 mb for, and 0.2 mb for (where mb denotes millibarns). The authors also established the existence of the reaction 1$(, n ) and studied the cross-section variation using bremsstrahlung work.
