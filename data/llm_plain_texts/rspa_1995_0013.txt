tldr: This article discusses the asymptotic analysis of surface source and implant problems in substitutional-interstitial diffusion models. The authors present solutions for two-dimensional surface source and implant problems, focusing on the limit where the surface concentration of impurity is much greater than the equilibrium vacancy concentration. They also explore a two-dimensional surface source problem for a vacancy model and provide insights into the behavior of impurity diffusion in semiconductor device fabrication.
