tldr: The author, John Stenhouse, explores the potential of obtaining artificial alkaloids from highly nitrogenated principles found in plants, such as vegetable albumen, fibrine, and caseine. He conducts experiments using horse-bean seeds and distills them to obtain various organic bases, including aniline, quinoline, picoline, and petenine. The process involves multiple steps of distillation, filtration, and neutralization to isolate the desired bases.
