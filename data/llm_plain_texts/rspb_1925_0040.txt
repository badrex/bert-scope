tldr: 'The author discusses four partial problems related to animal posture: reflex standing, attitude, righting function, and the role of nervous impulses. They explain how the nervous system integrates and balances different sense inputs to maintain proper posture and balance in animals. The author also describes the role of the brainstem, red nucleus, and other brain structures in regulating posture and muscle tone.'
