tldr: This article presents a relativistic quantum field theory approach to study the excited states of hydrogen. The authors develop a method that accounts for the instability of excited states and provides a modified propagator to calculate the energy-level shifts and decay coefficients. The method can be extended to higher approximations and offers a relativistic explanation for the Lamb shift and decay coefficients in hydrogen atoms.
