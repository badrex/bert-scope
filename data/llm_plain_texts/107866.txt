tldr: The author analyzed discrepancies between observed and calculated solar positions and found that they were mainly due to errors in the solar tables. By correcting the epoch, place of the perigee, and the greatest equation of the center, the author proposed improvements to the solar tables, which would require an increase in the epoch of the sun's longitude and a decrease in the mean anomaly.
