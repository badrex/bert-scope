tldr: The author presents a linearized Riemann solver for the time-dependent Euler equations of gas dynamics, which is a more efficient and simplified method compared to traditional finite difference methods. The linearized Riemann solver is used in conjunction with the weighted average flux numerical method to solve the Euler equations in one and two space dimensions. The results show that this method is accurate and robust, especially for flows with shock waves of moderate strength.
