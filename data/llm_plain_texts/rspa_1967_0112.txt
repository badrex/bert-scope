revised_title: 'Geological Folding and Rheological Stability with Couple Stresses'

  - Geology
  - Geological folding
  - Rheological stability
  - Couple stresses
  - Anisotropic elasticity
tldr: The authors extended the theory of elasticity and viscoelasticity to include couple stresses and the dependence of deformation on the second gradient of stress. This theory provides a continuous model for the mechanics of laminated media and is particularly suited to the analysis of folding and gravity instability of stratified sedimentary rock.
