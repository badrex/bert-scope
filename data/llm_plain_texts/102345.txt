tldr: This article presents Edmund Halley's discourse on Isaac Newton's theory of tides, which is based on the principle of gravity. It explains how the force of gravity decreases with distance and how this affects the motion of celestial bodies, including the Earth's tides. The author also discusses the impact of the Sun and Moon's gravitational forces on the ocean's ebbing and flowing, providing a deeper understanding of the natural phenomena.
