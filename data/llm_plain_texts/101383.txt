tldr: The authors discuss the priority of discoveries in geometry, specifically regarding the rectification of the parabolic line and squaring the hyperbolic space. They mention the contributions of M. Heuraet, M. Hugens, and Mr. William Neil, and argue that Mr. Neil's work predates the others. The letter also mentions the work of Sir Christopher Wren, who has not been accused of plagiarism in this context.
