tldr: This article explores the precursor principle and its potential significance in the formation of regional metamorphic minerals. It examines the role of chemical sediments, particularly stratiform ores and related materials, in understanding the processes of regional metamorphism. The author suggests that many regional metamorphic minerals may be derived directly from low-temperature sedimentary, diagenetic, or alteration materials, resolving the issue of elusive metamorphic mineral reactions.
