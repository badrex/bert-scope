tldr: Dr. Ez Tonge conducted experiments comparing the flow of sap in trees to a weather glass. He discovered that trees can better indicate weather changes than traditional weather glasses. He also explored ways to utilize birch water, including brewing and preserving it with various herbs. This research contributed to the understanding of tree physiology and potential uses of plant-based resources.
