tldr: The author investigates the effects of different methods of cleansing and treating metallic surfaces on the contact electricity of metals. They found that non-conducting solid films on metal surfaces can eliminate metal-air potentials, and that liquid films can cause significant changes in potential. The study also shows that exposure to the atmosphere does not usually produce rapid changes in Volta potential.
