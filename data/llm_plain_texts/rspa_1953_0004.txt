tldr: This study investigates the kinetics of the uncatalyzed oxidation of benzaldehyde in benzene solution. The authors found that the initial rate of the reaction is influenced by oxygen concentration and temperature, and they propose a relationship between the rate and the oxygen and benzaldehyde concentrations. The results provide insights into the mechanisms of thermal and photochemical reactions and have implications for understanding the behavior of uncatalyzed oxidations.
