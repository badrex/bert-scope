tldr: 'In 1908, L. H. Walter and Dr. J. A. Ewing developed a tantalum wave-detector that significantly improved wireless telegraphy and telephony. The tantalum detector was more sensitive, durable, and required no mechanical restoration, making it a valuable advancement in the field. It provided louder and clearer signals compared to previous detectors, such as the electrolytic and magnetic detectors.'
