tldr: The author, J. W. Griffith, discusses the debate on the nature of diatoms, organisms with unique markings on their valves. He argues that these markings are depressions, not cells, based on evidence from various species and the similarities in their microscopic appearances under different lighting conditions. This study contributes to the understanding of diatoms' classification and their place in the natural world.
