tldr: The study investigates the muscle receptor organ (AMCO-J1) and proprioceptive organization in the antenna of the rock lobster Palinurus vulgaris. The research reveals the existence of a muscle receptor organ responsible for proprioception of the J1 joint, providing insights into the mechanical and muscular organization of the two proximal joints, JO and J1. The findings contribute to understanding the complex sensory systems in crustaceans.
