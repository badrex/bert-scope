tldr: The authors generalize the Mariot theorem on congruences of null geodesics by defining the geodesic property of a congruence without referencing the conformal structure of the underlying manifold. They introduce the concept of flag structures and show that a flag structure is geodesic if any simple 2-form on the manifold satisfies a specific differential equation. The authors illustrate their theory with an example of a twisting geodesic null congruence on a 3-manifold.
