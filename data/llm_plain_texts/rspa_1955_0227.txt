tldr: The authors studied the structure and properties of abraded metal surfaces, focusing on the emission and photoelectric effects. They discovered that freshly abraded surfaces produce enhanced photoelectric sensitivity and emission peaks at specific wavelengths. The findings suggest that lattice imperfections in the oxide layer and oxygen ion vacancies contribute to these effects. The research has implications for understanding the behavior of surfaces in mechanical engineering and other fields.
