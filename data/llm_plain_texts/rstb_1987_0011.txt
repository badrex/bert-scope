tldr: 'This study investigates the neural pathways of the brachial nerves in Sepia and Loligo, revealing similarities in their central nervous systems. The research focuses on the connections between the arms and the inferior frontal, superior frontal, and vertical lobes, as well as the precommissural lobe. The findings provide insights into the neural control of the arms and the possible learning systems in these cephalopods.'
