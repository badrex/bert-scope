tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the effects of electricity on carbonic-acid gas. They discovered that when the gas is subjected to electric action, a certain proportion of it decomposes into carbonic oxide, oxygen, and ozone. The experiments showed that the ozone formed is the same as that generated from pure oxygen. The author also found the conditions most favorable for converting a large proportion of oxygen into ozone, which has important implications for chemical theory and the understanding of elemental bodies.
