tldr: The study examines the structure and characteristics of axon initial segments in neurons of primate motor and somatic sensory cortices. It describes the membrane undercoating and neurotubules in the initial segments, the distribution of synapses, and the presence of cisternal organs. The research provides insights into the integration of influences on neurons and the output determination of these cells.
