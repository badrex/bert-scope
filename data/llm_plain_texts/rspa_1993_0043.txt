revised_title: Heat Conduction in Inhomogeneous Suspensions

  - Heat conduction

  - Renormalization techniques
  - Averaged-equation approach
tldr: This article extends Jeffrey's calculations for the mean conductivity of a homogeneous suspension to inhomogeneous suspensions, where the particle probability varies over the length scale of the particle. The authors use the averaged-equation approach of Hinch to develop the general theory and calculate specific results for conduction parallel and perpendicular to a sudden jump in concentration. The effect of inhomogeneity is found to decay proportional to the cube of the ratio of the particle radius to the distance from the inhomogeneity.
