semantic_tags:
  - Soil permeability
  - Sodicity
  - Salinity
  - Irrigation
  - Soil structure
tldr: This article discusses the impact of sodicity and salinity on soil permeability and how controlling electrolyte levels in irrigation water can help maintain soil structure. It explains the mechanisms behind the decrease in permeability in sodic soils and the importance of understanding clay-particle interactions in relation to irrigation practices.
