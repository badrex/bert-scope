tldr: This paper explores the influence of magnetic forces on a rotating, incompressible, conducting fluid, focusing on the Earth's dynamo problem. The authors present an algorithm for determining the velocity of the fluid and demonstrate how the equations can be used to calculate the Earth's magnetic field. The results provide insight into the physical meaning of the equations and the behavior of the fluid in the dynamo process.
