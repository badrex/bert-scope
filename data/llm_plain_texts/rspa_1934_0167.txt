tldr: The authors conducted an X-ray analysis of the crystal structure of dibenzyl and found that it has a three-dimensional structure, unlike other aromatic compounds. The study used X-ray diffraction to determine the positions of atoms in the molecule and provided insights into the arrangement of the benzene rings and the connecting CH2 groups.
