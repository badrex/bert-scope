tldr: In the 18th century, John Stewart, an explorer, and Sir John Pringle, a member of the Royal Society, shared a letter detailing the discovery of the Kingdom of Thibet. The letter discussed the history, geography, and culture of Thibet, as well as the interactions between Thibet and neighboring countries. This exploration led to a better understanding of the region and its people, and opened up opportunities for future cultural and commercial exchanges.
