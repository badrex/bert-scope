tldr: The authors investigate the structure of bacterial flagella, focusing on the packing of polypeptide chains within the flagellum. They describe the histology of the bacterial nervous system and discuss the possibility of synaptic connections between medium-sized nerve cells and giant axons. The study provides insights into the function and structure of bacterial flagella and their role in cellular organization.
