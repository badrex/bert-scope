tldr: The author discusses the origin of the Indo-Gangetic trough, also known as the Himalayan foredeep, and proposes a hypothesis that it was caused by the opening of the Earth's sub-crust under tension, rather than horizontal compression or vertical subsidence. The author argues that this hypothesis is more consistent with observed facts and challenges the existing theories of other geologists.
