tldr: The authors discovered a new methoxy-dihydroxy-toluquinone produced by certain species of Penicillium, specifically in the P. spinulosum series. This substance, which they named 'Z', contributes to the high acidity and carbon content in non-volatile acids produced by these fungi. They also found that 'Z' is present in solution, partly free and partly as a complex that breaks down upon hydrolysis with acids.
