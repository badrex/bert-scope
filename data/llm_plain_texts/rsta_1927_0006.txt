tldr: This article presents experiments and theoretical analysis of the distribution of normal pressures on a prolate spheroid, conducted at the National Physical Laboratory. The study investigates the pressures on a spheroid in various motions, including rectilinear, rotational, and curvilinear, and compares the results with theoretical calculations. The research provides valuable insights into the forces acting on objects in motion through fluids, with applications in aeronautics and engineering.
