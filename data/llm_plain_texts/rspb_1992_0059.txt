tldr: This study investigates the effects of 5-HT on rat dorsal raphe neurons. The researchers found that 5-HT simultaneously increases potassium currents and inhibits calcium currents. This suggests that 5-HT reduces the excitability of these neurons by activating potassium channel currents and suppressing calcium channel currents.
