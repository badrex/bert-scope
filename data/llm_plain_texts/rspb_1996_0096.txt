tldr: The author examines the role of competition and expansion in the evolution of tetrapods, finding that competitive replacement has likely played a minor role. Most tetrapod families arose by expanding into the ecospace and geographic areas previously occupied by other members of the Tetrapoda. The study analyzed 840 non-singleton families of tetrapods, assessing their overlaps in time, space, and ecology to understand the prevalence of competition.
