tldr: This study examines the growth of slip surfaces, or shear bands, in over-consolidated clay and how they contribute to the progressive failure of slopes. The authors use concepts from fracture mechanics, specifically the J-integral, to derive conditions for the propagation of a concentrated shear band. They find that there is a strong size effect, which has important implications for the use of models in soil mechanics.
