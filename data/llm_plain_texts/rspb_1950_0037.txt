tldr: The author discusses the non-nervous origin of acetylcholine metabolism in the intestinal wall. They found that the continuous release of acetylcholine from the intestinal wall is not dependent on nervous activity. The released acetylcholine may increase muscle tone and motility, facilitate the peristaltic reflex, stimulate gland cells for secretion, and potentially influence absorption. The author also suggests that the released acetylcholine may act on nerve cells in the intestinal wall, keeping them in a continuous state of tonic activity.
