tldr: The authors conducted experiments on isolated goldfish retinas to study the effects of dopamine on retinal neurons. They found that dopamine depolarizes cone L-type horizontal cells and reduces the amplitude of light-evoked responses. The results suggest that dopamine may mimic the effects of interplexiform cell activity, which could regulate lateral inhibitory effects and center-surround antagonism in the retina.
