tldr: The author discusses the debate on the organic origin of Eozoon Canadense, a fossil found in the Serpentine-Limestones of Canada. They argue that the evidence for its organic origin is strong, despite challenges from Professors King and Rowney. The author presents new evidence from a specimen found in a sedimentary limestone formation, which they believe supports the organic origin theory. They also address the criticisms of King and Rowney, pointing out their errors and fallacies in their argument.
