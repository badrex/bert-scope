tldr: This article investigates the rate of change conditioned by a nickel catalyst in chemical reactions at solid surfaces. The authors compare the behavior of nickel catalysts to enzymes and explore the laws governing the rate of action in their presence. They find that the rate of change becomes constant when the surface is saturated with active molecules, and they study the transformation from linear to logarithmic curves in the presence of subsurface impurities. The results confirm the theory of mass action outlined by one of the authors in 1904.
