tldr: This study examines the response of two moth species, Biston betularia and Gonodontis bidentata, to industrialization and air pollution in northwest England. The researchers found that as air pollution decreased, the frequency of darker, melanic forms of B. betularia increased, while the frequency of lighter forms decreased. The study also found that the two-spot ladybird, Adalia bipunctata, experienced a decline in melanic forms in Merseyside. The authors discuss the potential selective agents and mechanisms behind these changes in moth populations.
