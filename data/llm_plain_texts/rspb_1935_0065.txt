tldr: The authors studied the influence of reticular tissue on the swelling of collagen in water and hydrochloric acid using tendons from young and adult rats. They found that the reticular tissue around collagen fibers in young rats was either greater in amount or tougher than in adult rats, which resisted the swelling forces. The swelling of tendons depended on whether and to what extent the reticular tissue was ruptured. In acid solutions, the reticular tissue was weakened, allowing it to give way under the forces of swelling.
