tldr: The authors analyze the energy loss mechanisms of electrons in the D region of the ionosphere. They find that the electron gas has a negligible non-thermal component, and the Maxwellian velocity distribution of the thermal component is determined by the neutral particle gas temperature. The main mechanisms for establishing equilibrium are rotational transitions in molecular nitrogen, and the energy loss times are much shorter than the attachment times, resulting in a Maxwellian distribution characterized by the gas temperature.
