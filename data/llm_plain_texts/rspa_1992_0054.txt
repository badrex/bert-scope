tldr: The author presents a method to remove the perturbations in eccentricity caused by air drag on satellite orbits of low eccentricity, particularly those with planes inclined close to the critical angle of inclination. The method involves transforming the spiral motion of the orbit due to air drag into a circle, which helps in determining the odd zonal harmonics in the geopotential. The author extends the theory to include satellite orbits with values of eccentricity greater than one.
