tldr: The authors conducted a series of experiments to study the intake and output of cholesterol in the human body. They analyzed the diets and feces of several subjects and found that the excretion of cholesterol in the feces can be influenced by factors such as diet and body weight. The study also identified various components of the unsaponifiable matter in human feces, including aliphatic alcohols and sterols, which play a role in cholesterol metabolism.
