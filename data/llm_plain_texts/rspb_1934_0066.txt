tldr: 'This study investigates the relationship between respiration in air and nitrogen of certain fat-storing seeds during germination. The researchers found that the respiration rate falls rapidly when seeds are transferred from an atmosphere of air to nitrogen, but can continue for a considerable number of hours without causing permanent damage to the cells. The return to aerobic conditions causes an increase in the respiration rate, which may continue to rise and then fall. The study also highlights the differences in respiration rates and respiratory quotients obtained by using the katharometer and the Pettenkofer methods.'
