tldr: This study presents the first accurate calculations of the nonlinear transfer of energy within a continuous spectrum of water waves. The research focuses on the energy transfer in the peak of a gravity-wave spectrum, using a simplified expression for the energy flux. The findings reveal that the energy flows away from the spectral peak in certain characteristic directions, and the detailed calculation of the energy flux to all parts of the spectrum is achieved through a single integral, allowing for accurate evaluation of the energy transfer.
