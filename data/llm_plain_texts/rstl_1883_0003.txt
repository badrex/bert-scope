tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments to determine the wave-lengths of the iron spectrum in the ultra-violet region. They used a Dutherfurd diffraction grating and a goniometer to measure the distances between lines in the spectrum. The results were used to create a map of the iron spectrum, providing a standard for the study of ultra-violet light and its effects on elements.'
