tldr: The author presents a method to solve the boundary-value problem of a harmonic plane electromagnetic wave incident on a perfectly conducting circular cylinder. The method uses Fourier integral transforms and provides alternative forms of solution for different regions, including the illuminated and shadow regions. This approach offers a relatively easy and straightforward application of Fourier integral transforms to the problem, leading to new developments and applications in related problems.
