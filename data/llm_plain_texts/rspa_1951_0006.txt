tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the angular distribution of neutrons emitted from the T-D reaction. They used a heavy-water vapor target and a triton beam at three different energies. The results showed that the disintegration occurred symmetrically in the center of mass space within the limits of experimental error.
