tldr: In 1761, Christian Mayer and his team observed the transit of Venus from Schwesing, using a variety of telescopes and instruments. Mayer's letter to Charles Morton details the setup and observations made during the event, including the use of an astronomical quadrant and a Newtonian telescope. The observations were made possible with the support of Charles Theodore, the Elector Palatine, who was a patron of astronomy.
