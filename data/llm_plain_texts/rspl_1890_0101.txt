tldr: The author investigates the use of bisulphite compounds of alizarin-blue and coerulin as sensitizers for rays of low refrangibility. They describe the process of preparing these compounds in a pure state and their properties, such as their ability to enhance the sensitivity of photographic plates in the violet and ultra-violet regions. The author also discusses the potential for commercial production of these compounds for use in delicate spectroscopic investigations.
