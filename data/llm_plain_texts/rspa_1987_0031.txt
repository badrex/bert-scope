tldr: The authors analyze the configuration of liquid films retained by surface tension forces on horizontal tubes with low radial fins, focusing on their implications for condensation heat transfer. They identify four 'flooding' conditions for trapezoidal-section fins and determine the positions around a tube at which these occur. The study suggests that maximum heat-transfer enhancement occurs when the spacing between fins maximizes the 'unblanked' finned tube surface area. The use of a radiused fillet at the fin root is also found to increase the 'unblanked' or 'active' area, potentially leading to improved heat-transfer enhancement during condensation.
