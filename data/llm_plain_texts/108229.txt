tldr: Eaton Hodgkinson conducted experiments to determine the strength of cast iron pillars and the factors affecting their structural integrity. He found that pillars with flat ends were stronger than those with rounded ends, and the ratio of their strengths remained constant for pillars with lengths at least thirty times their diameter. This research contributed to the understanding of the mechanics of materials and the design of buildings and structures.
