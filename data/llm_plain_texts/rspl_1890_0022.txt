tldr: This study investigates the effects of electrical stimulation on the motor cortex and internal capsule of an orangutan. The researchers found that the representation of body segments and parts in the orangutan's cortex was similar to that in the bonnet monkey. They also observed a higher degree of differentiation in the inexcitable cortex between areas representing different body parts. The study confirmed the results obtained from the bonnet monkey and provided insights into the localization of critical areas.
