tldr: This study investigates the effect of neutral salt, specifically potassium bromide, on the dissociation of acetic acid using spectrophotometric methods. The researchers found that the presence of sodium acetate in the solution reduces the ionization of acetic acid, while the neutral salt effect on the activity coefficients of the substances is negligible. The results show that the dissociation of acetic acid is slightly affected by the presence of potassium bromide, with a 5% increase in the dissociation constant.
