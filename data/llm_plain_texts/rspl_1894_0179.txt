tldr: The authors conducted experiments on monkeys to study the impact of sectioning sensory nerves on limb movement and nutrition. They found that the monkeys lost the ability to move and use their limbs, especially the hand and foot, after the section. The impairment was more severe in the finer, independent movements of the digits, which are represented in the limb area of the cortex. The study suggests that sensation plays a crucial role in these movements.
