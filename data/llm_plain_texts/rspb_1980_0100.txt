tldr: The article compares amino acid transport systems in human and sheep erythrocytes. It identifies three discrete amino acid transport systems in human cells and an additional system in sheep cells responsible for transporting both neutral and dibasic amino acids. The study reveals differences in substrate specificities and affinities between the two species, with implications for cell viability and glutathione biosynthesis.
