revised_title: 'Parthenogenetic Lizards More Prone to Infection: Supporting the Red Queen Hypothesis'
semantic_tags:
  - Red Queen Hypothesis
  - Parasite loads
  - Parthenogenetic reproduction
  - Sexual reproduction
  - Heteronotia binoei
tldr: This study found that parthenogenetic lizards of the Heteronotia binoei species complex are more susceptible to infection by mites than their sexual relatives. This supports the Red Queen Hypothesis, which suggests that sexual reproduction helps hosts maintain resistance against rapidly evolving pathogens and parasites.
