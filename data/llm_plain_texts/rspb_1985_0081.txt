tldr: This article discusses the metabolism of c-myc mRNA and protein in normal and malignant growth. The authors found that c-myc mRNA has a short half-life and is present in various cell lines, including Burkitt's lymphomas and HeLa cells. The c-myc protein, which is located in the nucleus, may play a crucial role in cell division and could be involved in mitosis. Further research is needed to understand the function of the c-myc protein in cancer development.
