tldr: The author discovered that dilute sodium chloride solutions have a toxic effect on the meningococcus, a type of bacteria responsible for meningitis. The toxic action is most potent when the concentration of salt is between 0.85% and 0.9%. The author also found that the toxic effect can be counteracted by adding a small amount of a bivalent salt, such as calcium chloride, with or without potassium chloride. This research helps in understanding the behavior of meningococci and developing potential treatments for meningitis.
