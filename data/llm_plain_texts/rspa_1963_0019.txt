tldr: This study investigates the rheological behavior of interfacial adsorbed films of macromolecules, focusing on elastic and creep phenomena. The authors form films using serum albumin, pepsin, polylysine, and arabinic acid at hydrocarbon/water interfaces and measure their rheology using a new rheometer. The results help understand molecular interactions and the flexibility of large molecules at interfaces, which is essential for understanding cell membranes and stabilizing foams and emulsions.
