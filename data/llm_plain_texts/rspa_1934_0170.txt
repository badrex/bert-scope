tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the electron emission and chemical reactions of liquid NaK with various gaseous compounds. They analyzed the electronic spectra of the reactions and determined the contact potential difference between the alloy and surrounding gases. The results helped establish a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms and energy distribution in chemical electron emission processes.
