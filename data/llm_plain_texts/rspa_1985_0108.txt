tldr: The author develops a statistical mechanics approach for inhomogeneous systems, using a one-body potential and a generalized grand potential. They obtain virial expansions for density, pressure tensor, and isosteric heat of absorption, and apply the theory to a model system of gaussian molecules and zeolite pores.
