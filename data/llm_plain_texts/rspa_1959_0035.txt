tldr: The authors derive the commutation relations for a quantum system using Schwinger's action principle. They consider a set of labelled variables and a unitary operator that satisfies a specific relation. The authors extend the discussion to relativistic quantum field theory with modifications. This work provides a general approach to describing systems and recovering the usual Bose and Fermi rules.
