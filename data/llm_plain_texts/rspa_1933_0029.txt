tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate the effect of oxidation on the lubricating properties of oil. They found that oxidation improves the lubricating value of oil, leading to lower friction and a higher seizing temperature. This discovery is important for understanding and improving the performance of lubrication systems, particularly in internal-combustion engines.
