tldr: The authors studied the unique relationship between Astrosclera willeyana, a siliceous ectyonine sponge, and a degenerate Floridean alga. They discovered that the sponge captures and envelops algal tetraspores and carpospores, secreting aragonite layers around them, forming spherules. This symbiotic relationship is not merely parasitic but an essential partnership between the two organisms.
