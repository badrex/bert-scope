tldr: The author investigates the composition of capryl alcohol obtained from castor oil. They confirm that it is a secondary or isoctyl alcohol, also known as methyl hexyl carbinol. Through a series of experiments, they determine the structure of the isoctyl group and the relationship between the boiling points of different alcohols and their carbon chain lengths.
