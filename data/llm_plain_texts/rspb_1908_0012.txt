tldr: The author conducted experiments on the inheritance of wrinkledness and roundness in peas by analyzing the starch-grains in their seeds. They found that the starch-grains in the F2 generation were intermediate between those of round and wrinkled peas, providing insights into the segregation of these traits in subsequent generations. This research contributes to the understanding of Mendelian inheritance and plant breeding.
