tldr: The author discovered that the Asian whistling-thrushes have bright ultraviolet coloration in their plumage, which suggests a unique case of ultraviolet communication in birds. This finding could have implications for understanding avian color signals and communication, as it highlights the importance of ultraviolet vision in birds and the potential role it plays in their communication and mating behaviors.
