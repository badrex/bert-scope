tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the gaseous condensable explosive compound produced from carbon disulphide vapour by the action of the silent electric discharge. They discovered that the transformation of the gas into a brown solid occurs in contact with solid surfaces and is accompanied by the evolution of light and heat. The authors also found that the amount of brown solid formed depends on the form of the apparatus and the amount of solid surface the ozoniser product passes over.
