tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the excitation of the band spectrum of helium. They discovered that certain bands in the spectrum can be selectively enhanced by varying the discharge conditions, such as using high-frequency oscillations or a specific type of discharge tube. This finding suggests that the helium band spectrum may consist of two separate systems, with the relative intensities controlled by the discharge conditions.
