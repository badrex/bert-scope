tldr: 'Scientists R. Hill and Sir Frederick Hopkins discovered that isolated chloroplasts from plants can produce oxygen when exposed to light. They used a spectroscopic method with haemoglobin to detect and measure the oxygen output. This finding provided insight into the photosynthetic process and the role of chloroplasts in oxygen production.'
