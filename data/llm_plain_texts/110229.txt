tldr: The author, Charles Daubeny, investigated the presence of iodine and bromine in various mineral waters in South Britain. He found that the proportion of these elements varied greatly among the springs and concluded that these analyses could shed light on the connection between the chemical composition of mineral waters and their medicinal properties. He also noted that these elements might be obtainable from English brine springs if needed.
