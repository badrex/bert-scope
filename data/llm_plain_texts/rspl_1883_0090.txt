tldr: The author investigates the figure of equilibrium of a planet with heterogeneous density, focusing on the relationship between internal density, compressibility, and pressure. They propose a new solution and compare it to Laplace's theory, considering various factors such as the surface density, precessional constant, and the modulus of compressibility.
