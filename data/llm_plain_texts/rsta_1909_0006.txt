tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the emission and transmission of X-rays using various elements as anticathodes in a discharge tube. They found a rough relation between atomic weight and radiation intensity, and observed that heavier metals produce more intense X-rays. The study also highlights the advantages of using an ionization method for measuring intensities.
