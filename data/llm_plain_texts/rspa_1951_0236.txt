tldr: The authors studied the adaptation of Bact. lactis aerogenes to D-arabinose and found that the bacteria develop an alternative metabolic route during growth. This direct adaptation allows the bacteria to survive on D-arabinose, and the presence of trained cells does not inhibit the multiplication of untrained cells. The findings suggest that a simple theory of mutation and selection cannot explain these observations, and a hypothesis of direct adaptation is more suitable.
