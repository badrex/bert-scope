tldr: The authors conducted high-resolution measurements of vibration-rotation bands of monodeuteroacetylene to determine molecular constants and bond lengths. They obtained new values for the coefficients relating rotational constants in different vibrational levels, leading to improved estimates for bond lengths in the molecule. This research contributes to the understanding of molecular dimensions and valency theories.
