revised_title: Attractive Scattering Potentials and Particle Concentration at the Origin
semantic_tags:
  - Quantum Mechanics
  - Classical Mechanics
  - Scattering Potentials
  - Particle Concentration
  - Semiclassical Limit
tldr: This article investigates the enhancement factors of attractive scattering potentials in one, two, and three dimensions, focusing on potentials that diverge at the origin. The study explores the concentration of particles at the origin and far upstream in the incident beam, considering both classical mechanics and the semiclassical limit of quantum mechanics.
