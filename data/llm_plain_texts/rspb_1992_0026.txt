tldr: 'This study investigates the morphological adaptations of song flight in passerine birds. The authors use aerodynamical flight theory to predict how changes in morphology affect flight performance during song flight displays. They find that song flight was not associated with a reduction in body size, but wing span, wing area, and aspect ratio increased, and wing loading decreased in males of species with song flight. This suggests that manoeuvrability and flapping flight performance have been the major selective forces affecting the morphology of males of species with song flight.'
