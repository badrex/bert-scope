tldr: This article discusses the experiments and observations conducted by Benjamin Franklin, William Brownrigg, and Mr. Farish on the ability of oil to calm and smooth waves. They found that oil spreads rapidly on water, creating a repelling force that smooths the surface and suppresses waves. This phenomenon was observed in various situations, such as with divers, fishermen, and in controlled experiments with ponds. The authors also explored the potential applications and further research opportunities related to this discovery.
