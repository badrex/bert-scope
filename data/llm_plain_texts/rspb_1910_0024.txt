tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine whether oxygen absorption by the lungs occurs through diffusion or an active physiological process. They found that under normal resting conditions, oxygen absorption happens only through diffusion. However, during muscular work, a supplementary secretory process helps to actively absorb oxygen from the alveolar air into the blood. This process is regulated according to the organism's physiological requirements.
