tldr: The authors develop a population model for migratory vertebrates by combining game theory models of foraging behavior with population biology. They consider the effects of interference and resource depletion on density-dependent mortality and use this model to predict the population decline resulting from habitat loss. The study highlights the importance of understanding individual interactions in predicting the consequences of environmental changes on populations.
