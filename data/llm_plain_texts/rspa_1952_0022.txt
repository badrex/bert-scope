tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the viscosities of liquid lithium, rubidium, and caesium. They used a specialized apparatus to measure the damping of oscillations in the liquid metals and applied a theoretical formula to calculate their viscosities. The results provide valuable data for understanding the properties of liquid metals and the liquid state in general.
