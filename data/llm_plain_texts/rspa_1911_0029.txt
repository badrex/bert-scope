  - Lightning
  - Radio interference
tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study natural electrical waves, such as those caused by lightning, and their impact on wireless telegraphy. They found that these waves can be intense and interfere with receiving antennas, causing difficulties for telegraph operators. The authors also discussed the limitations of their study and the need for further investigation into these natural electric waves.
