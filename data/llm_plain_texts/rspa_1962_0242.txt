tldr: The authors investigated the effect of localized transient stresses on calcite and found that twinning may or may not occur depending on the duration of the stress pulse, temperature, and a factor related to the length of the twin that may be formed. They suggested an hypothesis to explain the results and calculated the velocity of propagation of twin lamellae in the temperature range of 20 to 100Â°C. An activation energy for twin propagation was also calculated. Direct observation of the twinning process using a high-speed camera confirmed the hypothesis and results, showing that the velocity of propagation of twin lamellae in calcite is not very dependent on the applied shear stress.
