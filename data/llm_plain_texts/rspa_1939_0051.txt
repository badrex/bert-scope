tldr: The author critiques existing theories of crystal rectifiers and proposes a new one, suggesting that the insulating layer's thickness is crucial for the rectifier's functionality. The theory accounts for the direction of easy flow of electrons in both electron and hole-conducting semiconductors, providing a better understanding of crystal rectifiers' behavior.
