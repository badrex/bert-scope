tldr: The article discusses the current status and potential future developments in chemical approaches to crop protection. It highlights the need to improve the efficiency of using highly potent pesticides and reduce their environmental impact. The authors suggest focusing on methods of application, physico-chemical properties, and alternative chemical approaches to achieve this goal. They also emphasize the importance of considering chemical approaches alongside other methods of control in relation to the life histories and population dynamics of the species concerned.
