tldr: 'The article discusses the development of a rich conceptual system in infants alongside sensorimotor schemas. The author proposes that these concepts are represented by image-schemas, which are created through a process of perceptual analysis. This conceptual system allows infants to learn language by providing an interface between continuous perception and the discrete propositional forms of language.'
