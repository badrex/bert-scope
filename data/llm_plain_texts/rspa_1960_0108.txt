tldr: The author proposes a theory that relates the formation of the solar system to the general problem of star formation. According to the theory, interstellar material, consisting of fragments called 'floccules,' moves randomly and forms many stars simultaneously. The solar system was formed in a region with a specific radius, accounting for the amount of material and angular momentum within it. This process explains the mass, size, and number-density of planets in the solar system, as well as the sun's angular momentum and axial rotation.
