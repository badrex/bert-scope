tldr: The authors conducted a series of experiments to understand how the human body adjusts to muscular work, focusing on the respiratory and circulatory systems. They discovered that during strenuous exercise, the body experiences dyspnea, which is replaced by a sense of relief called "second wind." The authors found that carbon dioxide plays a significant role in the adjustment of the respiratory and circulatory systems to meet the demands of muscles for adequate blood supply. They also observed changes in urine excretion during exercise, suggesting that the kidneys play a part in adjusting the body to increased carbon dioxide and moisture output.
