tldr: The author, Leonard Horner, discovered a new artificial substance resembling shell, composed of carbonate of lime and animal matter. The substance has a unique foliated structure, iridescent appearance, and interesting optical properties. Sir David Brewster investigated its mechanical and optical properties, revealing it to be composed of laminae with double refraction, similar to agate and mother-of-pearl. The iridescent films form during the night when the dash-wheel is at rest, and these phenomena provide insights into the formation of incommunicable colors in mother-of-pearl.
