tldr: The author proposes a theory that explains the formation of crystalline structures, specifically fluor spar and other octahedral and tetrahedral crystals, by considering the elementary particles as perfect spheres that arrange themselves to be as close to each other as possible. This theory resolves the difficulty in determining the primitive form of these crystals and provides a basis for understanding crystallization in general.
