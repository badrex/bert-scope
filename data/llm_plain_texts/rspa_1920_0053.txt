tldr: 'The authors present a method for improving measurements by adding a linear compound of certain other quantities, called auxiliaries, to the original value. This method aims to minimize the mean square of error and is applicable to a wider range of cases than previous methods. The paper also introduces the concept of conjugate sets and their relation to error reduction.'
