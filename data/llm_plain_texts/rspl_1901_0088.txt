tldr: The author conducts experiments to study the effects of successive contrast on color perception. They describe various experiments using colored discs and lights, and discuss the phenomenon of areal induction and its impact on visual perception. The author explains that the first stimulus is inhibited if a second stimulus falls on a neighboring part of the retina, providing evidence against the need for a white sensation in the phenomenon.
