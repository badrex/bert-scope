tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the energy transfer in polyatomic molecules, specifically focusing on the catalytic efficiency of different molecules in transferring energy to the vibrations of sulfur dioxide. They found that some molecules, like deuterium oxide and hexane, were more efficient catalysts than others, and discussed various mechanisms for the catalysis of energy transfer.
