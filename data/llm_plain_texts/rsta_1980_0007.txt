tldr: This article reviews the evolution of passive continental margins, focusing on recent deep drilling results and the geodynamics project. It discusses the formation of rifted and sheared margins, the mechanisms of vertical movements, and the challenges in locating the continent-ocean crustal contact. The article also explores the relationship between continental splitting and the underlying mantle, and the importance of studying present rift systems and passive margins to understand the plate splitting mechanism.
