tldr: The author extended the Balmer series of hydrogen by using very long vacuum tubes and discovered a new type of vacuum tube and various spectroscopic phenomena. By reducing the continuous background and secondary spectrum, the author was able to photograph the series down to the 20th line, opening up a new field for the separation and study of compound spectra.
