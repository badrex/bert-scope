tldr: The author discovered a new species of crustacean, Lepidocaris rhyniensis, from the Old Red Sandstone in the Rhynie Chert Bed, Aberdeenshire. The crustacean is similar in appearance to Anostracan Branchipus or Chirocephalus but has unique features like the absence of stalked eyes and large biramous second antennae. The author used a new technique to examine the fossilized remains, which were found alongside other small arachnids and plant remains in the Chert.
