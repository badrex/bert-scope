tldr: The author investigates tubercular swellings on the roots of Vicia faba plants and discovers that they contain a fungus related to the Ustilaginese family. The fungus enters the root through root hairs and produces gemmules, which are scattered in the soil and can cause infection. The author also explains the process of budding, similar to that found in Ustilaginese fungi, and discusses the role of gemmules as spores in the infection process.
