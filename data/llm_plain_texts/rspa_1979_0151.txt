tldr: The authors explore the use of local diffeomorphisms in the bifurcational manifestations of the umbilic catastrophes. They study the hyperbolic and elliptic umbilic catastrophes and their imperfection-sensitivity plots in three-dimensional control space. The authors also consider a simple guyed cantilever model and demonstrate how the different forms of imperfection-sensitivity can be related to the model with specific initial configurations.
