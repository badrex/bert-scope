tldr: The article investigates the dependence of a radio signal's strength on the angle of incidence near the edge of the cone of directions within which a radio signal can reach an aerial within the ionosphere. The author develops methods to calculate the signal strength using Airy integral functions and discusses various cases of aerial designs and wave polarizations. The study also highlights the effects of the earth's curvature and magnetic field on the signal reception.
