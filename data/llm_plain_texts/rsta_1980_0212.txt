tldr: The authors studied the chemical composition of early major products of Tertiary volcanicity in the Scottish Hebrides, specifically the Sky Main Lava Series and the Mull Plateau Group. They found that the variation in incompatible elements in these lavas is consistent with a model of a mantle source from which a small amount of melt had been extracted. This suggests that the mantle beneath the Hebrides was neither residual from the formation of the Archaean Lewisian complex nor emplaced as a result of tension associated with the Cenozoic rifting of the North Atlantic.
