tldr: In 1769, Mr. Bayley made astronomical observations at the North Cape for the Royal Society, focusing on the transit of Venus and a solar eclipse. He determined the longitude of the North Cape by comparing his observations with those of Mr. Maskelyne at Greenwich. The study of timekeeping and the accuracy of the astronomical clock were crucial to these observations.
