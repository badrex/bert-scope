tldr: 'The author, William Huggins, observed the spectrum of Comet II in 1868 and found it to be similar to the spectrum of carbon. The comet's light was resolved into three broad bands, which matched the bands of carbon spectrum. This suggests that carbon might be a component of some comets. The author also discussed the implications of these findings on cometary phenomena and the relationship between the orbits of periodical meteors and comets.'
