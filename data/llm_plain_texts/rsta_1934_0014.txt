tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the freezing points, melting points, and solid solubility limits of silver-copper alloys with elements from the b sub-groups. They discovered that certain factors, such as atomic diameter differences, valency effects, and atomic rearrangements, influence the solubility limits in these types of alloys. The study provides a better understanding of the complex interplay of these factors in determining solubility limits in metallic systems.
