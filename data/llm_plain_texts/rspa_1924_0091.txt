tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the range of alpha-particles in rare gases, using a scintillation method. They found that the range of alpha-particles in helium and argon was shorter than predicted by previous theories. The results provided valuable information about the relation between observed stopping powers and calculated values in simple monatomic gases.
