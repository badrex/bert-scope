tldr: This study investigates the influence of chemical constitution on interfacial tension and surface energy. The author examines the behavior of various fluids and their molecular interactions, finding that interfacial tension is affected by factors such as chemical reactivity and molecular polarization. The results provide insights into the spreading of fluids and the development of contact differences in potential at interfaces.
