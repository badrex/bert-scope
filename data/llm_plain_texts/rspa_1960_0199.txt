tldr: This article investigates the heats of sorption and inclusion of fluorine compounds in faujasite. The authors found that the heats of inclusion for fluorine compounds are higher than those of corresponding hydrocarbons. The study also shows that the interaction between included molecules and the host crystal lattice is dominated by dispersion and repulsion energy contributions. The authors explain the difference between the heats of inclusion and the latent heat of condensation of the liquids, which arises from the different mechanisms of vaporization from the zeolite and from a liquid.
