tldr: The study investigates the effects of cytochalasin D on touch learning in Octopus vulgaris. The results show that cytochalasin D, when applied to the subfrontal lobe, blocks touch learning, while having no effect on visual learning. This suggests that filopodial extension, which is dependent on actin dynamics, is essential for complex learning and memory in octopuses.
