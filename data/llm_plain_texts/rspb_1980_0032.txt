tldr: 'The article investigates the morphological variation in Symbiodinium microadriaticum, a type of dinoflagellate, and its relationship to genetic differences. The researchers found that there are intrinsic morphological differences among the algae, which they interpret as indicating genetic differences. They also discovered that these differences are maintained when the algae are introduced into different host species, suggesting that the variations are genetically based.'
