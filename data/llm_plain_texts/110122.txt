tldr: 'Charles Babbage developed a system of signs, called "mechanical notation," to represent the actions of machinery. This system uses an algebraic-like approach to visually display the movements and interactions of various parts in a machine. Babbage found this method helpful in designing his calculating engine and demonstrated its use with examples of a hydraulic ram and an eight-day clock.'
