revised_title: The Electromagnetic Theory of Supraconductors
semantic_tags:
  - Supraconductivity
  - Electromagnetic field
  - Meissner effect
  - Electromagnetic equations
  - Quantum mechanics
tldr: The authors propose a new electromagnetic theory for supraconductors, replacing Ohm's law with a new fundamental equation. They explain the Meissner effect and describe the behavior of electric currents and magnetic fields in supraconductors. The theory provides a new perspective for understanding the electromagnetic field in these materials.
