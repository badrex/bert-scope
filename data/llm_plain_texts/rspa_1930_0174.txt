tldr: The author presents a symmetrical analysis of conical order and its relation to Time-Space theory. They demonstrate how to express a sum of one positive and negative square in a symmetrical form using real linear substitutions. This analysis reconciles the concepts of symmetry and congruence in Time-Space geometry.
