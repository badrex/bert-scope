semantic_tags:
  - Sexual differentiation

tldr: This article discusses the origin and primary localization of primordial germ cells in birds, focusing on the germ-cell line and sexual differentiation during embryonic development. The authors explore the factors influencing the germ cells' distribution and the role of gravitational forces in their localization. They also compare their findings to other vertebrates, contributing to a unitarian theory of the germ cell line in vertebrates.
