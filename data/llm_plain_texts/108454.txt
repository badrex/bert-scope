tldr: The author discusses the concept of dynamical stability and oscillations of floating bodies. They explain how the work required to incline a floating body is equal to the work needed to raise it through a certain height, and that the most stable ship has the greatest product of its weight and the difference in vertical displacements of its center of gravity and the immersed part. This theory has implications for naval construction and ship stability.
