tldr: In this article, M. Messier shares his observations of Jupiter's satellites and eclipses made at the Observatory of the Marine in Paris. He used a Gregorian telescope with a 30-inch focus and a magnifying power of 104 times to study the behavior of the satellites and their shadows. He also observed the variations in Jupiter's belts and made recommendations for the improvement of astronomical instruments.
