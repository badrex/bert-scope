tldr: This article describes a series of experiments conducted to determine if there is any effect of temperature on the weight of a body. The authors used a balance with one arm containing a brass cylinder that was subjected to varying temperatures while the counterpoise remained at a constant temperature. The results showed that there was no significant change in weight with a change in temperature, indicating that temperature has a negligible effect on weight.
