tldr: This study investigates the effect of potassium on the resting metabolism of the frog's sartorius muscle. The research finds that increasing potassium ion concentration in the surrounding fluid significantly increases the rate of heat production and oxygen consumption in the muscle. The findings suggest that a partial depolarization of the muscle fibers' surface can cause a change in internal organization, releasing some chemical processes that are usually activated by excitation. The study has implications for understanding the control of metabolic and contractile events within muscle fibers.
