tldr: The authors investigate the acoustic transmission properties of anisotropic sandwich panels with perforations, focusing on the interaction between sound waves and flexible wave-bearing panels. They develop an estimate for the acoustic power transmitted through the panel, averaged with respect to time and all possible directions of incidence. The study shows good agreement between the numerical evaluation of the estimates and experimental data, providing insights into reducing the transmission of sound energy through flexible panels.
