tldr: This study investigates the structural and functional aspects of plasticity in the nervous system through electrophysiological experiments on the axolotl. The research focuses on the mechanism and accuracy of neuromuscular specificity in the axolotl's supracoracoideus muscle. The findings reveal that peripheral selectivity plays a significant role in the reformation of coordinated movement in reinnervated legs, and the exchange of developmental information between motor nerves and muscle fibers is crucial for specific reconnection.
