tldr: The author discusses the discovery of hominid tracks made by three individuals in the Laetolil beds at Laetoli, Tanzania. These tracks, dated to 3.6 million years ago, show a fully upright, bipedal gait similar to modern humans. The author also examines the implications of these tracks in relation to the earliest known stone tools, bridging a gap of 1.6 million years between the two discoveries.
