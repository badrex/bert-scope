tldr: The author, Francis Sibson, examines the blow-hole of the porpoise and describes its complex anatomy and function. The blow-hole serves as the porpoise's respiratory system, allowing it to breathe while only a small portion of its head is above water. The blow-hole is controlled by a series of muscular pouches and intricate muscle arrangements that enable the porpoise to open and close the blow-hole, control airflow, and maintain buoyancy. This study provides valuable insights into the respiratory system and physiology of marine mammals.
