tldr: The authors conducted experiments on rabbits and rats to study the effects of acute anhydraemia on plasma electrolytes and electrocardiograms. They found that severe local oedema formation and fluid loss into the site of injury can cause changes in plasma electrolyte concentrations. These changes include a fall in sodium and chloride and a rise in potassium. The authors also observed similar electrocardiographic changes in anhydraemic rabbits to those in animals with artificially raised plasma potassium concentrations.
