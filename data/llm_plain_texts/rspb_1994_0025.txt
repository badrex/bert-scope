tldr: The study investigates the role of urine in sibling recognition in Atlantic salmon parr. The researchers found that Atlantic salmon parr can differentiate between the urine of sibling and non-sibling fish using electrophysiological and behavioral techniques. The results show that the mean recorded responses were significantly greater when parr were stimulated with the urine from sibling fish compared to non-sibling fish. This discovery highlights the importance of urine in providing information on kin identity in Atlantic salmon.
