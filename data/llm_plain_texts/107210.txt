tldr: Humphry Davy discusses his new electrochemical researches on various objects, particularly metallic bodies from alkalies and earths, and some combinations of hydrogen. He examines different hypotheses and experiments, providing his findings on the nature of potassium and its reactions with ammonia. Davy also describes the process of heating potassium in ammonia, producing hydrogene and an olive-colored fusible substance, and the subsequent reactions and results of these experiments.
