tldr: The authors studied the effect of donor additives on the initiation of polymerization by metal chelates, specifically manganese(III) acetylacetonate and iron(III) acetylacetonate. They found that donor additives significantly increase the rate of initiation and impart monomer-selectivity. The study provides insights into the initiation mechanism and the role of donor additives in free radical polymerization.
