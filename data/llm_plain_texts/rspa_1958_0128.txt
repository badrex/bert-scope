tldr: The authors discuss the initiation and growth of explosions in solids, specifically focusing on the ignition of explosives by light. They explore the thermal and photochemical processes involved in ignition and the use of spark sources to study the decomposition of lead styphnate monohydrate. The authors also mention the potential for using controllable light sources to study induction times and the relationship between ignition energy and ambient temperature.
