tldr: This paper presents an interim report on a spark chamber experiment that aims to determine the differential cross-section of the pion-nucleon scattering reaction near the resonance. The experiment was conducted using a pion beam produced from a target internal to the Nimrod vacuum vessel. The authors analyze the data obtained from the experiment and compare it with previous findings. The study provides insights into the behavior of pion-nucleon interactions and excited nucleon states.
