tldr: The author analyzes the spectra of stars to determine the order in which chemical substances appear at different temperatures. The study reveals that hydrogen appears in all stars, while other elements like magnesium, calcium, and metals appear at specific temperature ranges. The findings suggest that the elements' behavior in stars is related to their polymerization due to temperature reduction.
