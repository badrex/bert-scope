tldr: The authors conducted extensive interferometric measurements on the spectrum of krypton, finding it to be a suitable and accurate standard for spectroscopy. They used a new adjustable etalon interferometer and a constant temperature room to ensure stability and accuracy in their measurements. The results provide a scale of wave-lengths accurate to about one part in fifty millions, which can be used as a reliable standard for future spectroscopic research.
