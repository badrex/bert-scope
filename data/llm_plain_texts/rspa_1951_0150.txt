tldr: The authors conducted X-ray measurements on single crystals of caesium chloride to study the thermal transition in the crystal structure. Contrary to previous statements, the lattice expansion of the body-centered cubic (b.c.c.) crystal remains approximately linear with temperature until the transition point. Above the transition point, the intensity of X-ray reflexions decreases more rapidly than predicted by the Debye-Waller theory. The study found no interaction between the two crystal phases and suggested a simple hypothesis to explain the formation of distorted single crystals.
