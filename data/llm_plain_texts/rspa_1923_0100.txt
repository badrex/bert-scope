tldr: The author investigates whether damping of incident radiation can explain the abnormally small scattering of hard X-rays by aluminum, iron, and lead. They conclude that damping does not significantly affect the scattering of high-frequency rays and that alternative explanations, such as high-speed electron rings, must be considered. This research has implications for understanding atomic structure and the behavior of X-rays and gamma rays.
