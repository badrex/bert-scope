tldr: This article discusses high-energy observations of solar flares made by the Solar Maximum Mission satellite. It reveals that high-energy emission is a common property of solar flares and provides direct information about the composition, energy spectrum, angular distribution, and production history of energetic particles at the flare site. The findings challenge previous ideas about energetic flare particles and have led to new thinking about particle acceleration and transport during flares.
