tldr: The authors conducted experiments on ultrasonic relaxation in liquid sym-tetrabromoethane and tri-n-butylamine to study their rotational isomerism. They found that the relaxation is due to the equilibrium between rotational isomers in both substances. The results for sym-tetrabromoethane were compared with infra-red data, and the potential energy barriers hindering rotation between the forms of the molecule were determined. The energy parameters associated with a two-state model for tri-n-butylamine were evaluated and compared with previous results for triethylamine, leading to a molecular interpretation of the isomeric configurations responsible for the observed relaxation.
