tldr: This article explores the application of extremum principles to the laminar flow of a conducting fluid along a pipe with conducting walls under the influence of a uniform transverse magnetic field. The author establishes upper and lower bounds for the mass-flow rate and constructs asymptotic series at large Hartmann numbers. The study focuses on mixed boundary-value problems with walls composed of insulators and conductors, providing a formula for the lead-term in the asymptotic expansion for the flow-rate in a pipe with thick conducting walls.
