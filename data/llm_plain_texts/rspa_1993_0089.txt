tldr: The article discusses nodal surfaces, defined by wave vectors in reciprocal space, and periodic minimal surfaces, also known as'soap-film' elements, which are useful in visualizing significant structure in crystallography. These mathematical objects can help with the development of flexi-crystallography, a branch of crystallography dealing with structures characterized as'soft matter' by de Gennes. The author explores the use of nodal surfaces and periodic minimal surfaces in various crystal structures and their applications in understanding atomic arrangements and symmetry.
