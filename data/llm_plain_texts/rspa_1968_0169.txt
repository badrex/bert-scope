tldr: The authors conducted a detailed study of propane pyrolysis at low temperatures and pressures, focusing on the effects of heterogeneous processes and radical isomerization. They found that the ratio of methane to propylene increased with increasing propane pressure, and that heterogeneous effects became more significant as the temperature decreased. The results provide a better understanding of the reaction mechanisms and the role of radical isomerization in propane pyrolysis.
