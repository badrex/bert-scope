tldr: The study investigates the role of end-stopped cells in the striate cortex of cats in binocular depth discrimination. It shows that cells with a predominantly excitatory binocular response can make precise horizontal disparity discriminations, regardless of their optimal stimulus orientation, provided they are sufficiently end-stopped. The research outlines a neural mechanism for determining absolute viewing distance based on the sensitivities of striate cells to vertical retinal-image disparities.
