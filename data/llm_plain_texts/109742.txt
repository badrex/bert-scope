tldr: The author, Everard Home, observed that the progressive motion of snakes is partly performed by means of their ribs. He found that the motion of the ribs is common to all snakes and is adapted for their movement. The ribs do not interfere with the motion of the vertebrae and are connected to the muscles that help in the snake's locomotion. The small cartilage at the termination of each rib rests on the inner surface of the abdominal scutum, which helps in propelling the snake forward.
