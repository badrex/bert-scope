tldr: The author investigates the process of ether formation from alcohol and sulphuric acid, discovering that ether is produced from the decomposition of sulphovinic acid. The study also shows that ether can be formed from sulphovinate or sulphovinic acid without the presence of alcohol. This research provides insight into the chemical reactions and intermediates involved in ether synthesis.
