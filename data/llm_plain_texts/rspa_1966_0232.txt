tldr: The authors conducted experiments using a direct recording Perot interferometer to study the emission profiles of seventeen helium lines. They analyzed the Doppler and Lorentz contributions to the line broadening and found an additional "coupling width" that persists at very low density. The results confirmed the accuracy of recent theoretical calculations and established the measurement of resonance broadening as a reliable method for determining transition probabilities in helium.
