tldr: The author's micro-metallographic study of iron reveals a novel duplex crystallization process in large masses of wrought iron. Upon cooling, the metallic iron forms both primary and secondary crystals, with the secondary crystals being smaller and more numerous. This research contributes to the understanding of the microstructure of metals and has implications for the study of iron and steel.
