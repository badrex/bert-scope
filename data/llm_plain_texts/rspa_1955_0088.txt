tldr: This paper introduces the concept of kinematic waves, a type of wave motion that arises in one-dimensional flow problems with an approximate functional relationship between flow and concentration. The authors apply this theory to flood movement in long rivers, discussing the properties of kinematic waves and shock waves, and explaining how they can be used to predict flood behavior and manage river systems.
