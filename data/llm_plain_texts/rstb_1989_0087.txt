tldr: The article discusses the concept of mass extinctions as clusters of extinction episodes rather than single events caused by a single factor. It provides examples of various mass extinction events, such as the late Devonian, latest Ordovician, and Cenomanian-Turonian extinctions, which are shown to consist of multiple, separate extinction pulses. The author argues that these clusters of extinction episodes are not natural phenomena but rather mental constructs of geologists and paleontologists, emphasizing the importance of understanding the complex factors that contribute to these events.
