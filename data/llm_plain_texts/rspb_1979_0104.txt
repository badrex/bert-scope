tldr: This study found that mice fed on autoclaved diet had stronger cell-mediated immune reactions than those fed on an unmodified diet. The research suggests that this intensification of immunity is partly due to a deprivation of polyunsaturated fatty acids and partly due to an immunopotentiation by derivatives of retinol (vitamin A alcohol). The findings could have implications for understanding and improving transplantation immunity and overall health.
