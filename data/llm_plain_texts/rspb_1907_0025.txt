tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the fermentation of glucosides by bacteria in the typhoid-coli group and observed the acquisition of new fermenting powers by Bacillus dysenteriae and other micro-organisms. They found that some bacteria could ferment different glucosides, and through experiments, they attempted to create variations in these bacteria by growing them in media containing sugars they couldn't initially ferment. This research suggests that bacteria in the typhoid-coli group may not be distinct species but rather varieties or hybrids of one or more species.
