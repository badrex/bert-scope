tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the conditions necessary to preserve the viability of mammalian cells and tissues after freezing. They found that soaking tissues in glycerol-saline solutions before freezing significantly improved survival rates. The study also explored different freezing methods, including ultra-rapid freezing, and discussed the potential mechanisms of cellular damage during freezing and thawing processes.
