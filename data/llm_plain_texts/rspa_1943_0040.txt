tldr: The authors conducted an X-ray analysis of cholesteryl iodide to determine its crystal structure and stereochemistry. They found that the crystal structure confirmed the general view of sterol crystallography and provided new evidence on the stereochemical relations of the sterol skeleton. The study also demonstrated the use of heavy atoms, like iodine, in working out the structure of complex organic molecules.
