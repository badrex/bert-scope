tldr: The authors examine the spectra of atomic flames, which are flames supported by free atoms obtained from discharges through oxygen or hydrogen at low pressure. They study the differences between atomic flames and normal flames, focusing on the formation and excitation of active species like CH and OH, and the high electronic excitation of iron atoms in certain flames. The authors also investigate the effect of water vapor on the atomic flames and compare the spectra of flames using heavy water (D20) in the discharge tube.
