tldr: The authors conducted numerical simulations using the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations to study the instability of a flat-plate boundary layer. They observed flow field structures similar to those found in the vibrating-ribbon experiment and found that the development of strong shear layers and secondary instabilities play a significant role in the transition process. The simulations provide insights into the first five stages of boundary layer transition, which can help improve our understanding of the complex phenomena involved in the transition from laminar to turbulent flow.
