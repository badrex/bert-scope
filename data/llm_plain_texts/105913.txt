tldr: 'This article presents observations of the immersions and emersions of Jupiter's first satellite made at Funchal, in Madeira, using a reflecting telescope. The observations were conducted by Mr. Bird, Mr. Short, and Thomas Heberden, who recorded the times using a quadrant and a pendulum clock. The data collected helped in understanding the behavior of Jupiter's satellites and their eclipses.'
