tldr: The author analyzed magnetic data from Greenwich to study the rotatory character of terrestrial magnetic disturbances. They discovered that some disturbances have a diurnal distribution, with negative rotatory movements occurring before midnight and positive, clockwise movements after midnight. This study provides valuable insights into the complex subject of magnetic disturbances and could be a stepping stone for a general theory of the subject.
