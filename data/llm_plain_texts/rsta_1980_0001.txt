tldr: The authors present a numerical solution to study the interactions between large-scale structure and fine-grained turbulence in a free shear flow. They find that the large-scale structure gains energy from the mean flow and loses energy to the fine-grained turbulence, while the fine-grained turbulence gains energy from both the mean flow and the large-scale structure and loses kinetic energy through viscous dissipation. The results provide insights into the global energy evolution and production mechanisms of the fine-grained turbulence in the flow.
