tldr: The authors investigate the origin of the erythema curve, which represents the relative variation of skin reddening with different wavelengths of ultra-violet radiation. They discuss the relationship between erythema production and other local changes, as well as the general pharmacological actions of ultra-violet radiation. The study suggests that the erythemal response is due to photochemical decomposition of a constituent in the skin cells, leading to vasodilation and a diffusion time known as the latent period.
