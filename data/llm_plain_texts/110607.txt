tldr: The author investigates the geometrical forms of turbinated and discoid shells, specifically focusing on the logarithmic spiral as the generating curve for these shells. The study includes measurements of various shell types, leading to conclusions about the relationship between shell growth and the animal's growth, as well as potential applications for shell classification. The author also discusses the possibility of using this knowledge to explore the hydraulic theory of shells.
