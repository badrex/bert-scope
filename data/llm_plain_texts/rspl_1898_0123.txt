tldr: The author investigates the gastric gland in mollusca and decapod crustacea, focusing on the pigment enterochlorophyll. They study its structure, function, and how it is excreted. The author concludes that enterochlorophyll is a chlorophyll derivative, primarily taken up from the intestine and deposited with fat, and may be utilized for the production of other pigments.
