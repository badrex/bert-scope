revised_title: 'On the Ordinary Convergence of Restricted Fourier Series'
semantic_tags:
  - Fourier series
  - Cesaro convergence
  - Mathematical analysis
  - Summation methods
  - Integration theorems
tldr: The author explores the conditions required for the ordinary convergence of a restricted Fourier series and introduces a new theory concerning the failure of derived series to be a Fourier series. They also discuss the behavior of Fourier series at specific points and the role of integration theorems in understanding these series.
