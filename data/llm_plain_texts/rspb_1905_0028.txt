tldr: The author's research on Trypanosoma balbianii, a parasite found in oysters, reveals that it can adapt to both ectoparasite and endophytic conditions. The parasite's life cycle, structure, and reproduction are discussed, including its indifferent and female forms, as well as its similarities to other Trypanosomes. The study contributes to understanding the relationships between Trypanosoma balbianii and other members of its family.
