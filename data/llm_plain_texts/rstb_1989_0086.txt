tldr: This article discusses the causes of extinction, whether it's due to a species' inability to evolve rapidly or because its niche disappears. It highlights the importance of biotic factors in extinction and suggests that a species' inability to evolve quickly can predispose it to extinction. The author also emphasizes the need for a better understanding of the coevolution of many interacting species and the development of ecological theory to be more relevant to macroevolutionary problems.
