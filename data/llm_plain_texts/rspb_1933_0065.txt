tldr: This study investigates the response of hypophysectomized, ovariectomized, and normal anoestrous ferrets to injections of estrin. The results show that there is no significant difference in the sensitivity of the uterine endometrium to the hormone in these three types of ferrets. The study aims to understand the role of the anterior pituitary gland in the reproductive system and the effect of estrin on the uterus and vagina.
