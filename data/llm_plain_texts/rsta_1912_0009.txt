tldr: This article explores the theory of partitions of numbers, focusing on partitions in two-dimensional space and providing an adumbration of the theory in three-dimensional space. The author investigates generating functions, lattice functions, and inner lattice functions, establishing functional equations and presenting methods for determining these functions in various lattice configurations.
