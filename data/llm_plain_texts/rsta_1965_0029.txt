revised_title: Continental Drift Evidence: Ocean Islands Suggest Movement in the Earth
semantic_tags:
  - Plate tectonics

  - Mid-ocean ridges
  - Continental drift
  - Geological history
tldr: This article discusses evidence from ocean islands and their ages, suggesting that the Earth's continents have moved and drifted apart. The authors analyze the ages of oceanic islands and cores, and the geological history of the Atlantic Ocean, providing a pattern of surface movement that reflects deeper flow patterns. The findings support the theories of continental drift and plate tectonics.
