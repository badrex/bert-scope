tldr: 'The author, C.L. Dodgson, introduces a new method called "Condensation" for computing the arithmetical values of determinants. This method is faster and simpler than previous methods, especially for solving systems of equations with 2 or 3 unknowns. The process involves rearranging the given block of terms, computing the determinant of adjacent terms, and condensing the block until a single value is obtained.'
