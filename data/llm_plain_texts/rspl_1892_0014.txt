  - Michelson experiment
scientific_discipline: Physics > Electromagnetism
tldr: The author discusses the connection between ether and matter and examines the motion of ether near the Earth. They explore various experiments and theories, including the Michelson experiment, to understand the effects of motion on the velocity of light and the nature of ether. The author concludes that further experiments are needed to determine the true nature of ether and its relationship with matter.
