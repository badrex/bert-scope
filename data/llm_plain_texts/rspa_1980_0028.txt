tldr: The article describes the Penrose correspondence between solutions of the anti-self-dual zero rest-mass field equations in a self-dual Yang-Mills background on a self-dual space and the sheaf cohomology groups of its twistor space. It also explains how this correspondence relates to the self-dual Dirac equation and provides an interpretation for the cohomology of an elliptic complex on self-dual spaces.
