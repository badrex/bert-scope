tldr: The authors discuss the results of the Royal Society expedition to the British Solomon Islands Protectorate in 1965, focusing on the zoological and botanical collections made during the expedition. They analyze distribution patterns, species-area relationships, and the impact of island size and isolation on endemicity. The authors also consider the implications of the Island Theory of Biogeography and discuss the need for further research on the region's geology and fauna.
