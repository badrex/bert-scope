tldr: The authors observed and analyzed the anti-phase domain boundaries in an ordered copper-gold (CuAu) alloy using electron microscopy and transmission electron diffraction. They discovered that the periodic arrangement of anti-phase domain boundaries in the CuAu II structure can be directly resolved in the electron microscope, providing localized information on the arrangement of the boundaries. The study also revealed the influence of dislocations on the detailed arrangement of the anti-phase boundaries and proposed an alternative explanation for the formation of satellite reflexions in the diffraction patterns.
