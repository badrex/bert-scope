tldr: The authors studied the electrostatic fields of DNA and their role in drug-receptor recognition. They used stereoscopic visualization and topological analysis to investigate how nucleotide sequences and helical geometry affect these fields. Their findings show that the electrostatic fields depend on the sequence and structure of DNA, which could help understand how drugs bind to specific DNA sequences.
