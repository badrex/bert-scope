tldr: The authors present a geometrical similarity theory for expanding a hole in a thin plate. They assume a uniform hydrostatic pressure and show that the system remains geometrically similar, regardless of the degree of expansion. The theory considers a plastic-elastic material and accounts for work-hardening and thickening of the plate. The stress and displacement patterns are compared with those for a plate of constant thickness, and the residual stresses on release of the expanding pressure are determined.
