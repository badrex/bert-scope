tldr: The author investigates the radium content in basalts and compares their results with previous studies. They improve the measurement techniques by filtering out precipitates and dissolving undissolved matter, leading to lower radium content values than previous experiments. The author discusses the rate at which helium is produced in minerals like thorianite and pitchblende, contributing to the understanding of geological time and radiometric dating methods.
