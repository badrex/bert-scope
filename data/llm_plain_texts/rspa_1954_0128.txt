tldr: The authors conducted a study on the thermal decomposition of n-pentane and discovered two modes of unimolecular reactions, in addition to the radical chain process. One mode conforms to the classical theory with activation energy localized in a critical bond, while the other involves a series of alternative transition states. The findings have implications for understanding energy distribution and gain within the molecule.
