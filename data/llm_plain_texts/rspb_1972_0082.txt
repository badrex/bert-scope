tldr: The authors discovered that calcium ions in leaf extracts can inhibit, inactivate, and precipitate tobacco mosaic virus nucleic acid. They found that infectivity measurements of extracts containing calcium are invalid. The presence of calcium, nicotine, and spermine can prevent the movement of nucleic acid into the water phase during phenol extraction. The authors suggest that local concentrations of these substances may influence the infectivity of extracts.
