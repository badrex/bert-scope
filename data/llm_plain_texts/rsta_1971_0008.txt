tldr: The authors analyzed trace elements in igneous and metamorphic rocks from the ocean floor, specifically from rift zones of the Mid-Indian Ocean Ridge. They found that the transport of trace elements in the oceanic segment of Earth was controlled by two main processes: degassing of the mantle and primary formation of the oceanic upper mantle and crust. The study provides insights into the distribution of trace elements in different types of rocks and their potential implications for understanding the Earth's formation and evolution.
