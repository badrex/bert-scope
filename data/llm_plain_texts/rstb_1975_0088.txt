tldr: This article discusses the pedogenesis, classification, characteristics, and geography of soils in the New Hebrides islands. The soils mainly derive from basic volcanic rocks and are often young or rejuvenated by volcanic ash. They are differentiated into three main groups based on a climatic sequence due to the trade winds. The article also explores the relationships between these soils and the native vegetation.
