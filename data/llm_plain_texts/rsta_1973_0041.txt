tldr: This article discusses the potential of using radio interferometers to measure changes in Earth's strain, focusing on the challenges and possible developments in the field. The authors explore the use of quasars as reference points and the role of atomic time standards and video tape recorders in the process. They also consider the impact of the Earth's atmosphere on the measurements and the required accuracy for successful geodetic measurements.
