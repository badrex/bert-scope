tldr: The author investigates the problem of designing a cylinder's cross-section to minimize drag in a two-dimensional Stokes flow. They find that the optimal profile has a vorticity of constant magnitude at its surface and determine the minimum effective radius for such a profile. The study provides insights into the design of bodies experiencing minimal drag in fluid flows.
