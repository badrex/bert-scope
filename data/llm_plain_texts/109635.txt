tldr: Dr. William Herschel observed the figure, climate, and atmosphere of Saturn and its ring. He found that Saturn's figure is more flattened at the poles than Jupiter, and its atmosphere changes color with the seasons. He also noticed that the brightness of the polar regions is not uniform, suggesting the presence of a Saturnian atmosphere.
