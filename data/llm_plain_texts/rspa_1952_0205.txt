tldr: The authors studied the inhibiting effect of lead tetraethyl on the vapor-phase slow oxidation of diisopropyl ether and the ignition of diethyl ether. They discovered that lead monoxide, formed by the decomposition of lead tetraethyl, is responsible for the inhibition. The persistent effect is due to the deposition of lead monoxide on the reaction vessel's surface, which exerts its inhibiting action by destroying chain-ending processes.
