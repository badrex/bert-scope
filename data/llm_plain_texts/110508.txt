tldr: The author, William Whewell, discusses the importance of simultaneous tide observations made at distant places and shares the results of an extensive system of tide observations conducted on the coasts of Europe and America in June 1835. He explains the general character of these observations, the method used to reduce them, and provides a detailed discussion of the vast amount of information they provide about tidal phenomena. Whewell focuses on determining the precise form of cotidal lines, which represent the motion of the tide wave, and presents an accurate map of these lines, particularly in the German Ocean. He also covers topics such as the height of the tide, diurnal and semimenstrual inequalities, and general remarks on the accompanying tables.
