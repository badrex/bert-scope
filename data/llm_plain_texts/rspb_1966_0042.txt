tldr: The authors investigated the oscillatory contraction of insect fibrillar muscle after glycerol extraction. They discovered that the delay between length changes and tension changes is an intrinsic property of the contractile protein system, suggesting that this behavior is not dependent on the excitation-contraction coupling system. This study provides insights into the unique mechanical properties of insect fibrillar muscles and their contractile responses.
