tldr: This article presents a preliminary investigation of the inter-diffusion of copper and zinc using X-ray diffraction. The authors found that the diffusion of zinc into copper occurs when the temperature is raised above the melting point of zinc. They also discovered that during the diffusion process, the phases in the surface layers of the copper particles are produced in order from the zinc-rich end, even when the composition of the mixture as a whole is in the pure a-region.
