tldr: The author conducted monthly experiments to determine the number of bacteria in Thames water and analyzed the effects of temperature, sunshine, and river flow on bacterial life. They found that temperature had the most significant impact on bacterial growth, with higher temperatures leading to fewer bacteria. Sunshine and river flow also played a role in bacterial development, but their effects were less pronounced.
