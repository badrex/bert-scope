tldr: The author investigates the osmotic balance of skeletal muscles and the effect of oxygen on their response to hypertonic and hypotonic solutions. They find that oxygen reduces the initial intake of fluid from hypotonic solutions and alters the muscle's osmotic balance. The study also highlights the complexity of osmotic relations in muscles due to the chemical nature of the solutions and the properties of the muscle's surfaces as semi-permeable membranes.
