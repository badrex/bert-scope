tldr: The authors conducted an analysis of the 3β-ray spectra of thorium disintegration products, providing insights into atomic structure and nuclear physics. They found that most of the y-rays from thorium B and C could be accounted for by a system of levels, and discovered new lines in the spectrum. The study supports the hypothesis that 3-ray spectra are due to the conversion of y-rays in the various absorption levels of the atoms concerned.
