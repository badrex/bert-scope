tldr: The author, John Tyndall, conducted experiments to determine if water could replace sulfuric acid and caustic potash in sterilizing air. He found that by using turnip infusion and two connected test tubes, he could successfully prevent microbial contamination when air passed through a series of water-filled Liebig's bulbs. This discovery showed that water could be used as an alternative to harsh chemicals for air sterilization.
