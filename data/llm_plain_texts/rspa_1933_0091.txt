tldr: The authors investigated the infra-red spectra of sulphur dioxide and carbon disulphide using a grating spectrometer. They discovered that both molecules have an obtuse-angled triangular structure with a vertical angle of approximately 120 degrees. The study also found that the molecules' heat of dissociation and force constants are closely related to their position in the periodic table.
