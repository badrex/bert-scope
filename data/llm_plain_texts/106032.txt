tldr: In a letter to the Royal Society, James Badenach, M.D., describes an uncommon bird species he encountered in Malacca in 1770. He provides a detailed account of the bird's appearance, behavior, and habitat, but does not determine its proper genus. He offers the description to the society for further study and classification.
