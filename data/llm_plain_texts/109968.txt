tldr: Faraday J. Strock discovered two new compounds of chlorine and carbon, and a new compound of iodine, carbon, and hydrogen. The first compound, called perchloride of carbon, was created by exposing a compound of carbon, hydrogen, and chlorine to sunlight. The second compound was formed by exposing a mixture of iodine and olefiant gas to sunlight. Strock also discussed the properties and composition of these compounds, and his attempts to create a binary compound of carbon and iodine.
