tldr: This article discusses the relationship between density regulation and natural selection in populations. It explores how factors such as competition, disease, and mutual aid influence population density and how these factors drive natural selection. The author also examines the challenges of adaptation in different habitats and the role of gene frequency changes in the evolution of species.
