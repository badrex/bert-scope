tldr: This study investigates whether a novel bright color patch increases or decreases predation risk in European blackbirds. The results show that red wing patches reduce predation risk, as predators, mainly goshawks, attacked normal mounts more often than mounts with red wings. This finding contrasts with the assumption that bright, rare mutants suffer increased predation risk and has important consequences for the evolution of bright coloration in animals.
