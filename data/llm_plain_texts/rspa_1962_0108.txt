tldr: The authors compared experimental and theoretical values of the thermal conductivity of binary mixtures of nitrogen and hydrogen. They found that Hirschfelder's theory underestimates the thermal conductivity, possibly due to its inexact partition of the thermal conductivity for individual constituents. The discrepancies between theory and observation are unlikely to be due to errors in the assigned parameters.
