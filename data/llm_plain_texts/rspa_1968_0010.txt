tldr: The article discusses the applications of electron spin resonance (ESR) in studying reactive intermediates in chemical reactions. ESR is a technique that detects and studies particles with unpaired electrons, such as free radicals involved in various chemical and biochemical reactions. The author explains the challenges of using ESR to study short-lived radicals and the solutions, including physical and chemical procedures, to overcome these challenges. The author also highlights the potential of ESR spectroscopy in expanding the field of free radical chemistry and its applications in chemistry and biology.
