tldr: The authors conducted experiments on interstitial hydrogen atoms in alkali halides, measuring Faraday rotation and magnetic circular dichroism of ultraviolet absorption bands. They discovered large temperature-dependent magneto-optical effects, indicating significant spin-orbit coupling in the excited states of the transitions. This finding suggests that the excited states are primarily composed of lattice ion wavefunctions. The authors propose a new energy level scheme based on a charge transfer model, which they compare to their experimental results.
