tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the temperature during explosions using a modified pyrometric method. They used rhodium-platinum couples of different thicknesses in a bomb and observed the deflections of a galvanometer, which allowed them to calculate the maximum temperature reached during the explosion. The authors found that the size of the explosive grain and the position of the couple in relation to the explosive had little effect on the results. They used Ardeer ballistite, a mixture of gun-cotton and nitroglycerine, for their experiments.
