tldr: This article investigates the electronic properties and cluster effects in AgCl-NaCl binary mixtures using electron spin resonance (E.s.r.) spectroscopy. The authors find that the electronic behavior of these mixtures, which consist of covalent AgCl and ionic NaCl, exhibits unique properties due to the formation of solid solutions. They observe different types of electron-rich centers and conduction electron spin resonance signals, which provide insights into the microscopic structure and electronic properties of these mixtures. The results can be used to study the metal-insulator transition in semiconductors and understand the behavior of metallic clusters in different matrix environments.
