tldr: This article investigates the general motion of a spinning uniformly and rigidly electrified sphere, considering its center moving along a tortuous curve while spinning about any generally variable diameter. The author derives expressions for the force and couple constituents of the total mechanical reaction due to the electromagnetic field generated by the sphere's motion. The study reveals that the motion of the mass-center of the electrified body cannot be separated from its rotation except in certain special cases.
