tldr: Dr. Alston discovered a new method of producing lime-water by infusing quicklime in water for an extended period. He found that the stone calx vive could produce more than six hundred times its own weight of good lime-water. This discovery led to the use of lime-water in medical treatments, particularly for kidney stones. Lime-water's effectiveness in treating kidney stones was demonstrated through experiments, showing its potential in medical applications.
