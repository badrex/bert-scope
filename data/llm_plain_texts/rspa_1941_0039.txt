tldr: The author calculates the specific heat of a sodium chloride crystal using Born's theory and compares it with Debye's theory. The results show that the deviations from Debye's theory are due to its assumption of a v^2 law for the frequency distribution instead of the distribution following from the atomic theory. This study provides a better understanding of the specific heat behavior of crystals at low temperatures.
