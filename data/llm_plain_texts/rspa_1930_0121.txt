tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of a monomolecular hydrogen layer on the efficiency of molecular collisions. They found that the accommodation coefficient, which measures the thermal efficiency of collisions, decreases slightly when the surface is covered by a layer of hydrogen atoms. This suggests that the main mechanism of energy exchange between gas and solid in this case is elastic collision.
