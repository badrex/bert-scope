revised_title: 'The Effect of Temperature on Plant Respiration and Sugar Concentration'
semantic_tags:
  - Plant Respiration
  - Temperature Effects
  - Sugar Concentration
  - Potato Respiration
  - Low Temperature Depression
tldr: The authors studied the relationship between plant respiration and sugar concentration in potatoes, discovering that low temperatures cause a depression in the respiratory mechanism. They found that the accumulation of a depressant substance at low temperatures affects the respiration rate, and that the development of this depression is influenced by temperature. This research provides insight into the complex relationship between temperature, respiration, and sugar concentration in plants.
