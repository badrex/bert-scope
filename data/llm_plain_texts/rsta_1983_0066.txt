tldr: This article discusses the colloidal chemistry of inorganic materials in the context of cement hydration. It examines the behavior of oxide surfaces, equilibria between surface and solution, ion exchange at surfaces, and the stability of colloidal dispersions in cement paste. The study provides insights into the fundamental aspects of cement chemistry and suggests ways to improve the properties of cement materials.
