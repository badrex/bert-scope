tldr: This article examines the nervous system of Crinoidea, specifically the axial cords and sub-ambulacral nerves. The author presents new evidence from histological, anatomical, and physiological studies, challenging the widely accepted view that the sub-ambulacral nerves are the primary motor nerves in Crinoidea. Instead, the author argues that the axial cords play a crucial role in the motor function of the arms, while the sub-ambulacral nerves may have a sensory function.
