tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the effect of metallic binding on the atomic constants of light elements, focusing on beryllium. They found that the minimum energy needed for the excitation of X-rays in beryllium metal is considerably less than the ionization potential of the free atom. The study also revealed that the excitation process caused by an electron with an initial voltage V may occur when the electron has any velocity less than the initial velocity. The authors discovered that the true break-potentials are within the limits of error, independent of the nature of the filament.
