tldr: The author investigates the energy output of dock laborers during heavy work by measuring their carbon dioxide discharge. They compare two methods for determining energy output and discuss the advantages and limitations of each. The study finds that the energy output can be effectively measured by short samples of expired air, providing a useful tool for assessing the physical demands of various types of work.
