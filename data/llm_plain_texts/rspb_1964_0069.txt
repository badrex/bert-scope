tldr: The author discusses the physical and chemical basis of muscular contraction, focusing on the role of the tropomyosin-paramyosin system in tonic molluscan muscles. They find that this system has a pH-sensitive holding capacity and can be activated under conditions that cause intracellular acidification, such as high CO2 levels. This discovery helps explain the stretch-resistant state in these muscles and provides insights into the mechanisms of muscular contraction.
