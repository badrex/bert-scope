tldr: The author investigates the electrostatic forces between ions and their impact on the rates of reactions in solution. They develop a theoretical framework that accounts for the abnormal behavior of ionic reactions and explains the variation of reaction rates with temperature and ionic strength. This study provides a better understanding of solvent action and the role of electrostatic forces in chemical reactions.
