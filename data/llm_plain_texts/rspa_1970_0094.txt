tldr: This article explores the Cherenkov effect in anisotropic media using a Lorentz frame approach. The authors study the electromagnetic field generated by a charge in a medium with both electric and magnetic anisotropy, and they derive expressions for the field and radiated energy in closed forms. The results provide a clear picture of the physical situation and can be used to solve related problems on Cherenkov radiation in anisotropic media.
