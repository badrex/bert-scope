tldr: The authors conducted experiments on muscle stretching during a single twitch or short tetanus and found that about half of the mechanical work done by the muscle is absorbed as chemical energy, while the rest appears as heat. This discovery supports the idea that the physical system responsible for mechanical work is reversibly coupled with a chemical system during the active state, and this coupling is broken when activity passes off.
