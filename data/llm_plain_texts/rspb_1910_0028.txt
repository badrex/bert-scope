tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the development of trypanosomes in tsetse flies. They found that tsetse flies can transmit trypanosomes, which cause African sleeping sickness, to healthy monkeys. The researchers discovered that it takes an average of 32 days for a fly to become infective and that the infection can be transmitted through the fly's bite. The study highlights the importance of understanding the role of tsetse flies in the transmission of trypanosomes and the potential for controlling the spread of the disease.
