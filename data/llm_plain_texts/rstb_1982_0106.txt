tldr: This article reviews the antiviral action of interferon and its mechanisms. Interferon treatment induces cells to produce proteins that inhibit virus growth. The article discusses the role of two induced enzymes, 2-5A synthetase and protein kinase, and the multisite model for interferon action. Interferon is not just an antiviral agent but also induces changes in the cell membrane, cell size, and the cytoskeleton, and inhibits the growth of many cell lines.
