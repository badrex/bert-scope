tldr: The authors conducted experiments using synchrotron radiation to measure the absolute photoionization cross sections of helium, neon, argon, and krypton in the extreme vacuum ultraviolet region. The new data provides reliable cross section curves and helps compare with previous measurements and theoretical calculations. This research is essential for understanding energy balance and radiation transfer processes in fields like aeronomy, astrophysics, and plasma physics.
