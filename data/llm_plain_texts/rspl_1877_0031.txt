tldr: The author conducted experiments on frog motor nerves to study the effects of injury on their excitability. They discovered that injury to a motor nerve causes a marked alteration in its relative excitability towards stimuli supplied by closing and opening a voltaic circuit. The author also found that the increased excitability declines rapidly after the injury.
