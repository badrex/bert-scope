tldr: The authors investigated the absorption spectrum of chlorine monoxide (ClO) in the infrared region. They found four bands and analyzed the molecular structure using quantum mechanics. The results supported the triangular molecular structure and the isotope effect, providing insights into the forces acting between the chlorine and oxygen atoms.
