tldr: The article discusses the unique structure and function of the luminal plasma membrane of the mammalian urinary bladder, which has low permeability to water and ions. The membrane's structure consists of a hexagonal lattice of dodecameric subunits and contains cerebroside and cholesterol, which contribute to its low water permeability. The protein component has a high proline content, which plays a role in membrane structure and function.
