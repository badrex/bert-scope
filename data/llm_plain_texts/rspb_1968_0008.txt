tldr: The study investigates the calcium sensitivity of ATPase activity in myofibrils and actomyosins from insect flight and leg muscles. It finds that leg muscle has a low ATPase in the absence of Ca2+ and a large increase over a narrow range of Ca2+ concentration, while flight muscle has a greater ATPase in the absence of Ca2+ but shows a much smaller increase over a wider range of Ca2+ concentration. These differences are discussed in relation to the structural peculiarities and oscillatory mechanical activity of fibrillar flight muscle.
