tldr: The authors analyze the stability and post-buckling behavior of initially curved rectangular plates subjected to axial compression. They extend the analysis of previous parts to consider the case of free-edged rectangular plates with an initial curvature and explore the effects of distributed bending moments and compressive forces on these plates.
