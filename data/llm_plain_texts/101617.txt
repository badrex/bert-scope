tldr: Dr. Erasmus Bartholin conducted experiments with a unique crystal-like stone from Iceland, discovering its ability to refract light and create double images. The stone could be cut into thin plates, which when layered, showed objects as double. Bartholin believed the stone to be a type of selenite and observed its various properties, such as its electrical nature and its ability to show temperature differences. The double images created through the stone's refraction and reflection properties were studied, leading to further understanding of the crystal's unique characteristics.
