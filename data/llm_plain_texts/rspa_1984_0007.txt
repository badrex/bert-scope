tldr: This paper develops a theory for differential equations with doubly-periodic coefficients, extending the classic Floquet theory. The authors focus on the case when the exponent is rational and resolve a number-theoretic conjecture proposed in 1969. The theory is essential for understanding equations with only one singularity in each fundamental period parallelogram and is based on the 'exponent' of the equation.
