tldr: This article discusses the long-term effects of man-made chemicals on human health, focusing on national trends in disease patterns during the post-infection era. The author examines mortality rates, congenital malformations, and other health indicators to assess the impact of environmental chemicals on the population. The study finds that while overall mortality rates have decreased, certain diseases and conditions, such as lung cancer and ischaemic heart disease, have increased, particularly among men.
