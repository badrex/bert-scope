semantic_tags:
  - Microbial ecology
  - Terrestrial microbiology
  - Aquatic microbiology
  - Microbial community structure
  - Microbial adaptation
tldr: This article compares the properties of microbes and microbial communities in terrestrial and aquatic environments, highlighting similarities and differences in their characteristics, adaptations, and community structures. It emphasizes that despite the differences in habitats, the fundamental principles and problems of microbial ecology on land and sea are similar, focusing on microbial physiology, metabolism, and their roles in element cycling and carbon cycling in various ecosystems.
