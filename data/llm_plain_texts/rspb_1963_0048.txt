tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the accelerated training and adaptation of Bact. lactis aerogenes to 5-aminoacridine. They found that adaptation can occur in various media, and the resistance to the drug can be stabilized through repeated sequences of accelerated training and subculture in drug-free medium. The results suggest that mutation and selection theories do not fully explain the observed phenomenon, and further research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms.
