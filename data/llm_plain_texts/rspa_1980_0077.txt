tldr: The authors studied the climb mechanism of dissociated dislocations in face-centered cubic metals and alloys using the weak-beam electron microscopy technique. They found that prismatic loops nucleate on individual partial dislocations, and their growth is controlled by the climb force. This research provides a better understanding of the complex dislocation configurations formed at elevated temperatures.
