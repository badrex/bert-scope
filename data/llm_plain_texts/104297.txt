tldr: A boy with unusual bone growths on his back visits a hospital. The doctor, Mr. John Freke, examines the boy and describes the extensive bone growths that have been growing for three years. These growths arise from all the vertebrae of the neck and ribs, forming a bony structure resembling a bodice. The boy does not show any other symptoms of rickets in his joints. This case is submitted to the Royal Society for consideration.
