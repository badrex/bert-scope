tldr: The article discusses the environmental records provided by the Greenland Ice-Core Project (GRIP) and Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 (GISP2) ice cores, focusing on the abrupt and rapid climate shifts that occurred over the last 100-150,000 years. These shifts are in contrast to the relatively stable climate of the past 10,000 years and highlight the potential for significant thresholds in the Earth's atmosphere-ocean-cryosphere system. The relationship between these climate changes and the North Atlantic ocean circulation is also explored, along with possible correlations with climate change in North-West Europe.
