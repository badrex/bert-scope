revised_title: 'Heat Conduction in Random Suspensions of Spheres'
semantic_tags:
  - Heat conduction
  - Suspension
  - Sphere interactions
  - Statistical mechanics
  - Effective conductivity
tldr: The authors study the conduction of heat through a random suspension of spherical particles in a matrix of uniform conductivity. They calculate the average heat flux to the second order, considering interactions between pairs of spheres, and provide a modified equation for the effective conductivity of the suspension.
