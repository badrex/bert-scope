  - Space Travel
tldr: The authors discuss the potential of using algae for recycling and maintaining a balanced ecosystem in artificial environments, such as space stations. They explore the benefits of using algae, like Chlorella, for gas exchange, water recycling, and food production. The authors also address challenges and possible solutions for optimizing photosynthesis in these environments.
