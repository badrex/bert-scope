tldr: The author presents a transformation of Teukolsky's equation, which governs the perturbations of the Kerr black hole, to a one-dimensional equation. This transformation allows for a better understanding of the electromagnetic perturbations and the phenomenon of super-radiance. The study focuses on the range of frequencies for which the reflexion coefficient for incident waves exceeds unity, leading to super-radiance.
