tldr: This article investigates the motion of ocean tides in an ocean bounded by meridians, focusing on the semidiurnal tide. The author develops equations and solves them numerically to study the formation and development of amphidromic systems and the distribution of cotidal lines. The findings provide insights into tidal theory and can be applied to real-world ocean scenarios.
