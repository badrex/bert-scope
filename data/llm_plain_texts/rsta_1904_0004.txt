tldr: The author presents a new interferential form elasticity apparatus called the elasmometer, which can measure the elasticity of various solid substances, whether transparent or opaque, and whether polishable or not. The elasmometer uses an interference method with sodium light and a delicate balance to determine the coefficient of elasticity. This new instrument improves upon previous methods and offers greater convenience and accuracy in measuring the physical properties of crystals.
