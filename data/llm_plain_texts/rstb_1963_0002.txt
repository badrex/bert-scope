tldr: This study examines the cranial structure of Triconodon mordax and Trioracodon ferox, two Mesozoic mammals belonging to the Triconodonta order. The research reveals that their braincase has a reptilian pattern, with a persistent cavum epiptericum outside the ossified lateral wall. This finding challenges the idea of an evolutionary spurt when mammals came into existence and suggests that the Jurassic mammals were closer in structure to their reptilian ancestors than previously thought. The study contributes to our understanding of mammalian evolution and the relationships between early mammals and their therapsid predecessors.
