tldr: This study investigates the cool flame combustion of ethanol, focusing on the oxidation process and reaction mechanisms. The authors found that the cool flame combustion exhibits a long induction period followed by an acceleration period, during which the rate of reaction increases exponentially. The main products of the cool flame combustion include hydrogen peroxide, water, carbon oxides, acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, and methanol. The authors also discovered that the cool flame limits and induction and acceleration periods are reproducible under standardized conditions. The study provides insights into the factors responsible for the occurrence and features of cool flames, which are important in understanding knocking in internal combustion engines.
