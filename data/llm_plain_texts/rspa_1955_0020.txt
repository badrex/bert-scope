tldr: The authors present a quantum mechanical analysis of spin-echo phenomena using the density matrix concept. They explain the mechanism of echo formation, the effects of diffusion, and the modulation effects of coupling and chemical shift on spin-echo amplitude. The results are applicable to nuclear magnetic resonance experiments and can be extended to systems with multiple pulses.
