tldr: The author investigates a chemically active modification of nitrogen produced by an electric discharge, discovering its unique properties and afterglow. The afterglow is found to be connected to nitrogen and is influenced by factors such as heating and cooling. The glowing nitrogen also exhibits remarkable chemical properties, reacting with phosphorus to form red phosphorus.
