tldr: The author investigated the properties of ice formed from sea water and found that it remains salty even after freezing. The ice forms a unique structure with saline crystals on the surface, and the salt content varies depending on the freezing temperature. Efflorescence plays a role in breaking up ice floes. The author also explored the possibility of obtaining fresh water from sea ice through various freezing and melting processes but was unsuccessful.
