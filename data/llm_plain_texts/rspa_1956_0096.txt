tldr: This paper provides a simplified approach to Dirichlet's principle using the method of generalized functions and distribution theory. The author proves Dirichlet's principle for any bounded domain and demonstrates that the minimizing sequence represents a generalized function, which is harmonic and equivalent to an ordinary numerical function. The paper also discusses the weak form of Green's theorem and the differentiability of the generalized function.
