tldr: This study compares the reflex contractions of the cruralis muscle in decerebrate and spinal frogs in response to a single break induction shock applied to the ipsilateral sciatic nerve. The results show that the reflex contraction in decerebrate frogs has a prolonged tonic after-effect, while spinal preparations have a shorter latent period and a more rapid increment of height. The study suggests that the mid-brain exercises an inhibitory influence over the extensor centers in the spinal cord of the frog, similar to its inhibitory influence on flexor centers in the spinal cord of the cat.
