tldr: The authors conducted sorption and diffusion measurements of methane, ethane, and propane in a silica-alumina cracking catalyst. They developed a treatment to consider the influence of pore properties on surface diffusion and estimated some properties of surface diffusion coefficients. The study also examined the consequences of transient state diffusion coefficients depending on time due to differences in the roles of pores in steady and transient states of flow.
