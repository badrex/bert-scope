tldr: This article discusses the initiation of explosions in solid secondary explosives, focusing on the heat conduction equation and the integration of certain empirical relations to determine the explosion ignition time. The author also examines the effects of thermal radiation on steel plates covering explosive masses and the critical parameters involved in this process.
