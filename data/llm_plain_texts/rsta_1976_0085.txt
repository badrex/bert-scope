tldr: This article discusses the patterns of strain variation in arcuate fold belts, examining different models to explain their formation and the implications for their geological structure. The authors focus on the Iberian arc, a significant element of the Variscan fold belt in Western Europe, and analyze the finite strains in the region to determine its primary or secondary nature.
