  - Intensity measurements
tldr: This article presents measurements of the intensities of lines in the secondary spectrum of hydrogen at different temperatures. The authors found that the intensities of certain lines were affected by temperature changes, which may have implications for the understanding of the hydrogen spectrum and the behavior of specific heat at low temperatures.
