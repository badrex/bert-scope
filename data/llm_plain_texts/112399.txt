tldr: The author, J. Herschel, conducted spectroscopic observations of southern nebulae and found that some have continuous spectra, while others show a mix of continuous and bright lines. This discovery challenges the idea that nebulae are purely gaseous or solid and suggests that condensation may be in various stages in all nebulae.
