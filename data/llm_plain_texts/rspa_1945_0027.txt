tldr: The authors study the catalytic cyclization of aliphatic hydrocarbons, focusing on the role of catalysts and the mechanism of the reaction. They find that certain oxides, such as molybdenum oxide, are highly active catalysts for aromatization. The authors also investigate the effect of different catalysts on the yield and nature of the cyclic hydrocarbons produced, and explore the role of alumina as a support for the active catalysts.
