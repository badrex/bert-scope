tldr: In 1769, Dr. Alexander Wilson and his team observed the transit of Venus over the Sun from Glasgow. They used various instruments, including telescopes and reflectors, to make precise measurements of the event. The observations were challenging due to atmospheric conditions and the state of the air, but the team managed to collect valuable data. The transit of Venus was an important event for astronomers, as it helped them study the size and distance of the planet and refine their understanding of the solar system.
