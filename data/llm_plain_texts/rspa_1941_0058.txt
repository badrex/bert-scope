tldr: The authors conducted spectroscopic observations on hydrocarbon flames burning in atomic oxygen to determine if the ethylene flame bands occur in these flames. They found that the bands are strong in benzene and acetylene flames but weak and diffuse in ethylene flames. The study also revealed the presence of C2, CH, and HO bands in various hydrocarbon flames.
