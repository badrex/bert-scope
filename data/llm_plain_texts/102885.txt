tldr: The author, Jos. Morland, presents a detailed explanation of how secretions are performed in animal bodies. He describes the process of separating thin and thick fluids from the mass of blood, focusing on the roles of the kidneys, liver, and other glands. Morland's theory is based on the structure and function of blood vessels, ducts, and the circulation of blood in the body.
