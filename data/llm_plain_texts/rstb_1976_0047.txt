tldr: This article summarizes the United Kingdom's contribution to the International Biological Programme (I.B.P.) focusing on montane grassland and moorland ecosystems. The study aimed to measure primary and secondary production and describe the main pathways of dry matter and nutrients within these ecosystems. The research was conducted on two main sites, Snowdonia and Moor House N.N.R., with supporting studies on heathlands, dwarf shrub communities, and grouse moors. The findings provide insights into the functioning of these ecosystems and contribute to the international range of I.B.P. sites.
