tldr: The author investigates the frequency distribution of red cell resistances to saponin, a lysin, and describes a direct method to determine this distribution. They find that the upper extreme of the distribution is consistent, while the lower limit varies. The study highlights the variability in the form of the frequency distributions and the potential for further investigation into these distributions.
