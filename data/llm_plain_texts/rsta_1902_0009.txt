tldr: This article presents experiments conducted to verify Boyle's law for gases at pressures between 75 and 150 millimetres of mercury. The author uses a unique manometric gauge to measure pressure accurately and confirms that the law holds true for air, hydrogen, and oxygen, with minor deviations for argon. The study highlights the importance of temperature control and precise volume measurements in these experiments.
