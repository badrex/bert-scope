tldr: This study examines the pH and total alkalinity of three lakes in northern New England over the past 300 years, using diatom and chrysophyte remains in sediment cores. The results indicate that lake acidification is caused by anthropogenic acid deposition, with extreme acid-sensitive lakes like these three being atypical for the region. The study also compares pH and alkalinity reconstructions based on different calibration equations and methods, providing insights into the effects of anthropogenic acid deposition on lakes.
