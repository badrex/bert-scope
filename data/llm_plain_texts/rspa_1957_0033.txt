tldr: This article discusses submarine gravity measurements conducted in the Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Red Sea, and Mediterranean Sea by R. W. Girdler and J. C. Harrison. The measurements were taken using a Veiling Meinesz three-pendulum apparatus on H.M. Submarine Acheron. The authors provide details on the apparatus, navigation methods, and the results of the measurements, which were used to calculate free-air anomalies and Eotvos corrections. The study aimed to improve understanding of oceanic currents and bathymetry.
