tldr: Hans Werner Lissmann was a pioneering biologist who overcame extraordinary difficulties to become a pioneer in experiments on animal locomotion and the discoverer of the electric sense in fishes. He conducted research on the behavior of Siamese fighting fishes and made innovative use of mirrors and models to analyze the interaction between fighting males. Lissmann later worked in the Cambridge Zoology Department, where he continued his research on animal behavior and made significant contributions to the field.
