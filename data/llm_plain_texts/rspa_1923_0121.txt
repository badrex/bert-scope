tldr: The authors investigated the velocities of secondary cathode particles ejected from metallic surfaces by X-rays. They used a precise experimental method to measure the energies associated with different electronic orbits within atoms, aiming for an accuracy of one part in 1,000. This work contributed to the understanding of atomic structure and the further development of the theory of atomic structure.
