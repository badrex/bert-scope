revised_title: 'Direct Measurement of Acetylcholine's Effect on Outer Hair Cells in the Guinea Pig Cochlea'

tldr: Researchers conducted experiments on isolated outer hair cells from the guinea pig cochlea and found that acetylcholine activates a large, rapidly desensitizing outward potassium current. This discovery provides direct evidence for acetylcholine as the neurotransmitter of the cochlear efferent system in mammals and sheds light on the role of outer hair cells in mechanical amplification of sound.
