tldr: This article presents an experimental method to determine the cross sections for the quenching of excited sodium atoms by molecules and atoms present in flames. The method involves irradiating homogeneous flames with resonance radiation and measuring the fraction of absorbed light that is re-emitted as fluorescence. The results show that the cross sections are independent of temperature and provide a direct measure of the efficiency of transferring electronic energy to other forms.
