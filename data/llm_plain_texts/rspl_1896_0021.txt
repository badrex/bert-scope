tldr: The author presents observations on atmospheric electricity conducted at Kew Observatory using an electrograph and electrometer. They discuss the influence of a tall building on potential gradients and analyze the potential at various stations to deduce the potential gradient in the open. The study provides insights into the impact of the environment on atmospheric electricity.
