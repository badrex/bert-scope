tldr: The authors studied the non-isothermal oxidation of 2-methylpentane and analyzed the products of cool flames. They found that cool flames produce over forty molecular species, including O-heterocycles, peroxides, alkenes, and saturated and unsaturated aldehydes and ketones. The alkylperoxy radical isomerization theory provides a good qualitative description of the formation of this complex mixture. The authors concluded that chain propagation in the cool-flame region occurs predominantly by attack on the fuel by hydroxyl radicals, and the oxidation is rapid and unselective.
