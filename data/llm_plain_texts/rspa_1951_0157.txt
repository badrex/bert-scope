revised_title: Temperature Distribution in Radiating Gas Streams with Chemical Reaction
semantic_tags:
  - Combustion
  - Heat transfer
  - Chemical reactions
  - Flame temperature
  - Dimensionless parameters
tldr: The article investigates the temperature distribution in gas streams where heat is released by a chemical reaction. It examines the effects of different parameters, such as fuel richness and heat transfer mechanisms, on the temperature-distance curve. The study provides insights into the behavior of flames and helps in understanding combustion processes.
