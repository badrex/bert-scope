tldr: Researchers successfully introduced new genes into mice, resulting in the expression of foreign genes and the growth of larger, healthier animals. This technique was used to correct the genetic defect causing the small size of the mutant little mouse. The transgenic animals provide a valuable tool for studying gene expression and have potential applications in gene therapy and genetic engineering.
