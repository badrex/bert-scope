tldr: This article discusses the genetic disorders of human haemoglobin and their role in understanding gene regulation. It explores various mutations and deletions in the globin gene cluster that cause thalassaemias, a group of inherited anaemia disorders. The study of these disorders provides valuable insights into the regulation of gene expression and protein synthesis.
