tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the absolute energies of groups in magnetic ray spectra. They used a modified method to photograph ray lines and measure magnetic fields, which allowed them to determine the energies of specific strong lines from one body. These measurements were essential for comparing relative energies of ray lines from different bodies and improving the accuracy of energy measurements in nuclear physics.
