tldr: The authors present a new mathematical treatment of the electrical heating of conductors, which leads to a concise derivation of the accepted theory and three new conclusions. They demonstrate that the spatial distribution of current within a conductor is independent of its thermal and electrical properties and can be calculated using a simple numerical integration. The theory is applied to the calculation of the spatial distribution of current for a particular shape of conductor relevant to resistance welding processes, showing good agreement with experimental data.
