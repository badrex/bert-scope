semantic_tags:
  - Quaternion algebra
  - Relativistic wave equation
  - Dirac equation
  - Quantum mechanics
  - Electromagnetic fields
tldr: This article explores the use of quaternions in the relativistic wave equation, specifically the Dirac equation. The author demonstrates the advantages of using quaternion methods, such as the simplicity of combining vectors and the clear relationship to four-space. The article also discusses electric and current density in the context of the wave equation.
