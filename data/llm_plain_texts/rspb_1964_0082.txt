tldr: The authors investigated the effects of various cations on the resting potential of cat spinal motoneurons. They found that potassium and rubidium injections did not significantly alter the resting potential, while injections of caesium, sodium, and lithium caused varying degrees of depolarization. The study suggests that the resting motoneuronal membrane is permeable to alkaline cations in the order of K > Rb > Cs > Na > Li. The results provide insights into the differential permeability of the resting membrane to cations and the ionic changes induced by injections.
