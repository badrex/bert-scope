tldr: This article studies the acoustic and vibration fields of a plane fluid-loaded structure with a local reaction spring-stiffness term. It examines the reflection of structural waves from a rigid baffle or free edge and analyzes plane wave diffraction by a semi-infinite surface with local reaction. The results predict the acoustic scattering from a large but finite structure and compare it with rigid-body scattering. The study shows that structural waves' monostatic scattering decisively dominates rigid-body scattering over a significant range of angles around the grazing incidence condition.
