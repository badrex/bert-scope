tldr: The author investigates the relationship between body size and abundance in bird communities, focusing on the effects of phylogeny and competition. The study finds that tribes of birds with no close relatives tend to have a positive relation between size and abundance, while those with strong interspecific competition have negative relations. The results suggest that larger species may have an advantage in interspecific competition, leading to higher densities at the expense of smaller species.
