tldr: 'This article presents the results of magnetical observations made at Ascension Island from July 1863 to March 1866. The observations focused on magnetic declination, horizontal force, and dip. The data collected was used to analyze the Earth's magnetic field and its variations over time. The findings were compared to previous observations made at other locations, such as St. Helena, to understand the larger patterns of Earth's magnetic field.'
