tldr: The authors develop a theory of dynamic sink strengths to study the effects of pulsed irradiation regimes on void swelling and irradiation creep in metals. They derive dynamic void and dislocation sink strengths and find that, under steady-state pulsing conditions, it is usually acceptable to replace dynamic sink strengths with steady-state sink strengths. However, dynamic sink strengths are required for studying damage during the initial transient under continuous irradiation conditions.
