tldr: The author investigates the electrical resistivity of potassium at low temperatures and finds deviations from Mathiessen's rule. They analyze the data using the two-band model and discuss the role of umklapp scattering processes. The results provide insights into the ideal resistivity of potassium and its temperature dependence.
