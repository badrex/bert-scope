tldr: This article examines the uranium mineralization in the Witwatersrand and Dominion Reef systems using mineralogical methods. The authors investigate the controls of uranium mineralization in these sediments, analyzing ore microscopy, electron microprobe, fission track, and neutron activation methods. They discuss the depositional environments and the role of uranium in solution, providing insights into the origin of uranium mineralization in quartz pebble conglomerates. The study has implications for the discovery of uraniferous conglomerates and understanding the formation of similar deposits.
