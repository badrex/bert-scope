tldr: In this article, Stephen Gray discusses his experiments on attracting and preserving electrical charges in various substances, such as rosin, stone pitch, shell lac, beeswax, and sulfur. He found that these substances could attract other objects when they were properly prepared and preserved, and that this attractive power could last for months. This discovery led Gray to believe that there might be a permanent attractive power in all electrically charged bodies, without the need for friction or other forms of excitation.
