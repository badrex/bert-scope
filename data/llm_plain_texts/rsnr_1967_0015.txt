tldr: 'The Animal Chemistry Club was a specialized group formed in the late 18th century to promote the study of Animal Chemistry. It was an assistant society to the Royal Society and included notable members such as Humphry Davy, Charles Hatchett, and William Brand. The club aimed to combine the talents of chemists, anatomists, and physiologists to advance the field of Animal Chemistry. Although the club remained small and relatively ineffective, it provided a space for scientific discussion and collaboration among its members.'
