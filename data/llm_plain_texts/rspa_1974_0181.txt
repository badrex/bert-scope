  - Numerical Integration
tldr: The authors estimate pressures on the surface of a delta wing moving at supersonic speed using numerical integration of two semi-characteristic forms of equations for inviscid supersonic flow. They compare the results obtained from both forms and conclude that the pressures given are close to the true theoretical values.
