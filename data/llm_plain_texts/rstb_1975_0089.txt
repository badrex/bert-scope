tldr: The article discusses the phytogeographical relationships and origin of the fern flora in the New Hebrides. The authors analyze the distribution of fern genera and their affinities, concluding that the flora is a young and mixed one, derived from neighboring archipelagos like the Solomon Islands, Fiji, and New Caledonia. The study highlights the absence of endemic fern genera in the New Hebrides, which is a common characteristic of oceanic islands' fern floras.
