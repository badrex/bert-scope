tldr: This article explores the mathematical styles and techniques of John Wallis and Isaac Barrow, two key figures in early modern English mathematics. It examines the tension between their algebraic and geometric approaches and how their work reflects the broader intellectual context of the time, including debates on ancient and modern ideas and educational reform. The article challenges the traditional categorization of Wallis and Barrow as modern and traditional mathematicians, respectively, and suggests that their conceptions of mathematical continua were influenced by non-mathematical debates.
