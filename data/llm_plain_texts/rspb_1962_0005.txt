revised_title: 'Schiff's Bases in Haem a Compounds and Their Role in Cytochrome Group a'

  - Schiff's bases
tldr: The authors studied the reaction between haem a compounds and proteins in alkaline solutions, forming Schiff's bases. They discovered that the formyl group in haem a compounds is replaced by a group of less electronegative character, leading to a shift in absorption bands. This reaction is significant for understanding the structure and function of cytochromes in group a.
