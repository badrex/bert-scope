tldr: The authors retract a previously published mitochondrial cytochrome b sequence for a thrush due to errors caused by contamination and incorrect amplification. They believe contamination with another DNA and co-amplification of a nuclear homologue contributed to the errors. The retraction affects the integrity of the entire 924-bp sequence.
