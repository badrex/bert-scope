tldr: The 1975-76 drought in England and Wales significantly affected groundwater and aquifers, with low recharge during winter 1975-76 leading to low aquifer storage. The authors discuss the effects on groundwater levels, storage, and the potential long-term consequences on British aquifers. They also highlight the importance of groundwater in England and Wales' water supply and the role of climate in influencing groundwater levels and recharge.
