tldr: The author discusses the effect of mountain masses on the apparent astronomical latitude of stations in geodetic surveys. He explains that the attraction of mountain masses disturbs the apparent astronomical latitude due to the assumption that the interior of the earth is a dense fluid or semi-fluid (lava) and the exterior crust floats upon it. This leads to a numerical calculation showing that there would be a tendency for the table-land to crack and sink in the middle, which cannot be resisted by the cohesion of rocks.
