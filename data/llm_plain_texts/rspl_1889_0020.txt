tldr: The author, William Huggins, investigates the limit of solar and stellar light in the ultra-violet spectrum. He observes that the solar spectrum abruptly weakens at about X 3000 and appears to stop at about X 2985. Comparing this to the spectra of stars like Vega, Huggins concludes that the limit is due to atmospheric absorption, not a property of the stars themselves.
