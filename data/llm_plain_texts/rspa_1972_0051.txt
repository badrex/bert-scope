tldr: The authors study the radiative decay and intramolecular coupling in highly excited electronic states of large molecules, focusing on the second excited singlet state. They develop a theoretical model to understand the decay patterns and interference effects in the radiative decay process, providing insights into the behavior of large molecules like aromatic hydrocarbons.
