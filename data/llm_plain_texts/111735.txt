tldr: The author, James Booth, discovered a property of numbers with six places that are divisible by the prime numbers 7, 11, and 13. The numbers have a specific pattern where the digits repeat in groups of three. This property can be extended to other prime numbers like 17, 19, and 23, but with longer periods.
