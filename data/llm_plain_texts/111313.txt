tldr: The author, William Pole, shares his personal experience with color blindness, specifically dichromic vision, where he can only see two primary colors, blue and yellow. He explains how this affects his perception of other colors, such as red appearing as shades of yellow or being invisible, and green appearing as no color at all. This study provides insights into the nature of color perception and how it can vary among individuals.
