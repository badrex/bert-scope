tldr: The authors study the behavior of buoyant vortex rings in fluids, focusing on the effects of buoyancy and circulation on the rise and expansion of the rings. They develop a theory based on the perfect fluid approximation and predict that increasing buoyancy leads to a greater rate of expansion and a lower velocity of rise. The findings may be applicable to larger-scale atmospheric phenomena, such as explosion clouds.
