tldr: 'This study investigates the effects of radium on cell division in vitro using tissue cultures. The researchers found that radium exposure can stop cell division, but it returns after the radium is removed. The study also shows that some cells can begin and complete mitosis during radium exposure. These findings suggest that radium may have potential applications in controlling cell growth.'
