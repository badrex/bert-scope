tldr: The author, E. Frankland, discovers new organic compounds containing metals, such as stanethylium, zincmethylium, and hydrargyromethylium. These compounds are formed by the union of alcohol radicals with various metals and exhibit powerful electro-positive characters. The author describes their properties, formation, and reactions, and suggests that these compounds could lead to new series of organic compounds and a better understanding of their constitution.
