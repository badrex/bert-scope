tldr: This article discusses the progress made in understanding the physical and chemical basis of muscular contraction. It highlights the importance of calcium ions in activating the contractile material and the role of various proteins in muscle fibers. The author also presents a re-determination of the isometric length-tension diagram of isolated muscle fibers, providing insights into the relationship between sarcomere length and tension development.
