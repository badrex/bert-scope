tldr: 'The article describes the anatomy and functional morphology of Mosasaurus hoffmanni, the largest marine reptile known. It provides insights into its advanced characteristics, such as a robust skull and tightly assembled palatal complex, which allowed it to adapt to its large-headed structure. The analysis also reveals that Mosasaurus hoffmanni was a surface-swimming animal with a somewhat uncomplicated habitat, living in nearshore waters with rich vertebrate and invertebrate life.'
