tldr: The authors investigated the electron emission from sodium-potassium (NaK) alloys when exposed to various gases, such as Cl2, Br2, I2, NOCl, HCl, N2O, and COS. They found that the energy distribution of emitted electrons is independent of experimental conditions and that the electron spectrum can be determined by analyzing the characteristic curves. The study helps to understand the mechanism of chemical electron emission and the connection between the chemical reaction's energy and the energy of emitted electrons.
