tldr: The authors conducted a study on the band spectra of alkaline earth fluorides and their relation to each other. They observed several new bands and used these findings to develop a formula that represents the numerical relations among the band spectra of similar compounds of different elements. This research helps in understanding the atomic and molecular properties of these compounds.
