tldr: The author investigates the light border phenomenon in photographs, which occurs when a dark object is photographed against the sky. They suggest that the phenomenon is caused by the interaction of light rays of different refrangibility, which affects the phosphorescence of the photographic plate. The author also explains how the proportion of rays of low to high refrangibility in different light sources can influence the phosphorescence and the light border phenomenon.
