tldr: The author examines the pelvic characteristics of Thylacoleo Carnifex, an extinct marsupial lion, and compares them to those of other existing and extinct marsupials. The study provides evidence of the carnivorous adaptations in the pelvis of Thylacoleo Carnifex, which is distinct from herbivorous marsupials like Macropus major. The author also discusses the possible diet of the marsupial lion and its relation to the surrounding flora and fauna.
