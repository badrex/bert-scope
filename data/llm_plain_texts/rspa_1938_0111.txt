tldr: The authors conducted experiments with benzene and methyl alcohol vapors to study adsorption at plane surfaces of mica. They discovered that the adsorption energy is nearly constant for small coverings, and it falls rapidly to a minimum value before increasing to a value close to the normal heat of liquefaction. The results suggest that the multimolecular films' densities may not differ significantly from those of bulk liquids.
