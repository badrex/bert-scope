revised_title: Anisotropic Thermoelastic Conservation Laws and Applications to Fracture Mechanics
semantic_tags:
  - Thermoelasticity
  - Anisotropy
  - Fracture mechanics
  - Conservation laws
  - Stress intensity factors
tldr: This article extends the conservation laws in anisotropic elasticity to include steady-state thermal elasticity, leading to path-independent contour integrals that yield stress intensity factors directly. The authors apply these integrals to obtain closed-form solutions for a finite crack in an unbounded thermoelastic medium with arbitrary thermal conditions on the crack faces. The results can be used to calculate energy release rates and stress intensity factors in fracture mechanics.
