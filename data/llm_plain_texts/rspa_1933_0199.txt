tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the flame speeds in moist carbonic oxide-oxygen mixtures. They found that the maximum flame speed occurs when the composition is approximately 75% carbonic oxide. The authors also emphasized the importance of accurately controlling the moisture content and temperature of the mixtures for accurate flame-speed measurements.
