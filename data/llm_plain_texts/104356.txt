tldr: Mr. William Watson observed a case of hydatidiform mole, a type of abnormal pregnancy, where a large number of hydatids were voided per vaginum. The hydatids appeared like the ovary of a boiled hen, with a difference in their contents. The woman recovered her health after the discharge of these hydatids.
