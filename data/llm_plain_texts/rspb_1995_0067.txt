tldr: The author conducted an experiment to test the breeding experience hypothesis in collared flycatchers. They found that individual quality differences were likely to cause the observed higher reproductive success of experienced two-year-old females compared to inexperienced ones. The study also showed that breeding experience had no or very little effect on reproductive performance compared to the effects of reproductive costs. This suggests that other age-related improvements in competence, such as foraging and nest site selection, are responsible for the change in reproductive success with age.
