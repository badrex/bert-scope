tldr: The author, Alexander Marcet, conducted experiments to produce cold by evaporating the sulphuret of carbon. He discovered that the evaporation process causes a rapid drop in temperature. The experiments showed that the cold produced by this method is limited, and further attempts to increase the effect have been unsuccessful.
