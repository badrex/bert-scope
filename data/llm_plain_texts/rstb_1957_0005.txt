tldr: This study examines the nervous coordination between coral polyps and their responses to electrical stimulation. The author found that different coral species have varying levels of coordination and transmission of excitation between polyps. The concept of through-conducting pathways and interneural facilitation, which is valid within individual polyps, is not completely adequate for explaining the transmission of excitation between polyps. The author suggests that the concept of a through-conducting system loses its sharp outline and that the spatial spread of excitation varies depending on the number of electrical shocks.
