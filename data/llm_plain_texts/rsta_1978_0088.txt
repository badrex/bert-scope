tldr: This study investigates the stratigraphy and sediments of Bewick and Stapleton islands in the northern Great Barrier Reef through drilling. The researchers found three to four disconformities in the Bewick core, which helped them interpret changes in the environment of deposition and diagenetic effects. The findings contribute to understanding the formation of islands in the Great Barrier Reef.
