tldr: 'This article presents an experimental study on the viscosity of carbon dioxide at different temperatures and pressures. The author developed an adapted version of Rankine's apparatus to measure the viscosity using a mercury pellet and a capillary tube. The results provide valuable data on the behavior of carbon dioxide under various conditions, contributing to the understanding of gas dynamics and high-pressure physics.'
