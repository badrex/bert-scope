tldr: The author investigates the enhanced lines in the spectra of various elements, such as aluminum, bismuth, and iron, using a large 42-inch Spottiswoode coil. By comparing spark and arc spectra, the author determines the wave-lengths of these enhanced lines and their intensities. This research contributes to the understanding of stellar spectra and the study of elements.
