tldr: The author presents a statistical analysis of the curve of oscillation for the radiation emitted by a black body. They demonstrate how the distribution of energy in the spectrum can be used to describe the characteristics of the radiation, including the mean wavelength and the number of maxima, minima, and zeros per centimeter. The study applies to various temperatures and types of energy distribution in the spectrum.
