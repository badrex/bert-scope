tldr: The author examines the group of braids that can be constructed from untwisted threads tied together at each end. They develop an algorithm to determine if a given braid can be constructed using a specific plaiting process and describe a calculation procedure for the process. This research has implications for textile engineering and manufacturing braids with fixed bobbins.
