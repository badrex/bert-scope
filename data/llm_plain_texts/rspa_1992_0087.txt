tldr: The authors present a quantitative analysis of Selberg's trace formula, which is an exact version of Gutzwiller's semiclassical periodic-orbit theory for quantizing classically chaotic systems. They discuss two main applications of the trace formula: periodic-orbit sum rules and the Selberg zeta function. The authors also explore the convergence properties of the relevant series and the role of long periodic orbits in chaotic systems.
