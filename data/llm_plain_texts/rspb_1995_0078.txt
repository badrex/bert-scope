tldr: The article examines the unique inner ear structure of the echidna, a monotreme mammal, focusing on its vestibular sensory organs. The echidna's inner ear contains more sensory organs than other mammals, including a lagenar macula, a sense organ found in all non-mammalian vertebrates. The study provides detailed information about the structure, innervation, and fine structure of the hair cells in the echidna's vestibular sensory organs.
