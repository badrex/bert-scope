tldr: The author investigates the toxic effects of albumose, a protein found in the seeds of Abrus precatorius (jequirity) plant. They found that albumose, when separated from the toxic globulin, causes symptoms similar to those of the globulin, including a rapid fall in body temperature, rapid breathing, and local oedema. The author also discovered that heating the albumose solution to 80°C destroys its toxic activity. This research contributes to understanding the toxic properties of the jequirity plant and its potential uses in medicine and research.
