tldr: The author examines the mineral composition of the Breitenbach siderolite, a type of meteorite, and identifies three main minerals: ferriferous enstatite (bronzite), silica (quartz), and chromite. The author also discusses the crystallography and properties of these minerals, as well as the possible effects of the meteorite's rapid journey through the atmosphere on its mineral composition.
