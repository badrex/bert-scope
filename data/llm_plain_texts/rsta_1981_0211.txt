tldr: The author discusses the possibility of a cataclysmic event in the early Solar System, such as a violent solar event or a nearby stellar explosion. This event could explain the large angle between the Sun and the planetary disc, the missing hydrogen and helium in the domain of Uranus and Neptune, and the solar neutrino problem. The author also mentions the low Z model of the Sun and the Gallium Solar Neutrino Experiment, which aims to measure the low energy pp-solar neutrino flux.
