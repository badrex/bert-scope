revised_title: 'Quantitative Analysis of Motor Endplates in Dissociated Muscle Fibers'
semantic_tags:
  - Neuromuscular junction
  - Muscle fiber dissociation
  - Acetylcholine receptor
  - Endplate area
  - Cholinesterase staining
tldr: The authors developed a method to dissociate skeletal muscle into single fibers, allowing for the precise measurement of acetylcholine receptors and endplate area. This technique can be used to study the morphology and receptors of motor endplates, providing valuable insights into neuromuscular junctions and muscle function.
