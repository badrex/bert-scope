tldr: The author examines possible restrictions on constitutive laws for finitely deformed elastic solids, focusing on isotropic materials. They explore the interrelations between different inequalities and establish some statical implications. The study depends on several ancillary theorems that have intrinsic interest in the broader field of stress-strain analysis. The main result is a general inequality that implies the stronger version of the postulate, which is essential for understanding the behavior of elastic solids under finite strain.
