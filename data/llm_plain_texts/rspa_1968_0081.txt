tldr: The authors conducted experiments on impulse corona discharges in rod/plane gaps and developed an electrostatic fluxmeter to measure electric fields and charge densities. They found that the transient at the center of the plane is a double pulse, with the first pulse due to induced charge on the plane surface and the second pulse from electron emission. The space charge electric field can be as great as 8, and the conduction current density in the corona is 45. The fluxmeter allows separation and measurement of induced charges and conduction charges in the discharge process.
