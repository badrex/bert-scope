tldr: The author, John Winthrop, examines a passage in Castillione's work and clarifies Sir Isaac Newton's views on geometry and algebra. He argues that Newton did not censure himself for using algebraic calculations in geometry but rather criticized others for doing so. Winthrop also highlights Newton's preference for the ancient geometrical form of demonstration over algebraic calculation and his attention to the distinction between these methods in his work, Principia.
