tldr: Arthur Cayley investigates the properties of matrices for automorphic linear transformations of bipartite quadric functions. He establishes the properties of the matrix for transforming the function xw' - yz' - y' - wx into XW' + ZY' - ZY' + WX. This work is an extension of his previous memoir on automorphic linear transformations and is applicable to any even number of variables.
