tldr: The article discusses the influence of organometallic chemistry on the stereoselective reactions of chiral α-amino aldehydes. The authors describe the synthesis of doubly protected α-dibenzyl α-amino aldehydes and their reactions with Grignard reagents, lithium enolates, and other organometallic reagents. They found that these reactions exhibit high diastereoselectivity and non-chelation control, which can be explained by molecular modeling and the Felkin-Anh model. This method allows for the effective exploitation of the chiral pool of amino acids in organic synthesis.
