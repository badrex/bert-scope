tldr: This article discusses the thermodynamic properties of substances whose intrinsic equation is a linear function of pressure and temperature. The author presents a method for finding the principal foci, principal points, and equivalent focal length for a system of two thin lenses at varying distances apart. The concept of "pseudo-principal points" is introduced to describe the positions at which the magnitude of the image is in a constant ratio to that of the object for every value of the pressure and temperature.
