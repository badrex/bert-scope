tldr: The authors derive a gauge-invariant spin Hamiltonian for molecular systems using Dirac's wave equation. They explain the problem with the existing theory and provide a general formula for the principal values of an orbitally non-degenerate molecule. This work improves the understanding of molecular systems in the context of magnetic fields and perturbation theory.
