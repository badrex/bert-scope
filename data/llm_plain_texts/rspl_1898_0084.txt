tldr: The authors conducted a study on the topographical anatomy of the abdominal viscera, focusing on the gastrointestinal tract in humans. They developed a method for surface marking the abdomen that is independent of variable surface points and provides reliable landmarks for deeper parts. This method helps in understanding the interdependence of positions of various organs and their mutual relations, which is essential for clinical purposes.
