tldr: The authors extend the self-consistent field theory to open-shell systems, where some orbitals are singly occupied. They develop a method to improve the density matrices for both closed and open shells simultaneously until self-consistency is achieved. This generalization allows for a better understanding of systems like ions, free radicals, and atomic theory.
