tldr: The authors conducted experiments with steel discs to study the failure of elastohydrodynamic lubrication, a common issue in heavily loaded, lubricated contacts like gears. They developed a new model that takes into account the effects of surface roughness on both the hydrodynamics and contact mechanics of the system. This model suggests that a thin film of lubricant with high viscosity is necessary to avoid damage from asperity interaction, and that this high viscosity is provided by the main elastohydrodynamic system. The authors argue that this new model can help explain the failure of elastohydrodynamic lubrication and provide a better understanding of scuffing in machinery.
