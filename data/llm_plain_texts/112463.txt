tldr: The author analyzes the molecular constitution of gases in the sun and stars, using spectroscopy to study their outer atmospheres and the exchange of heat between them. They discuss the temperature and density variations in the sun's photosphere and the role of convection currents in cloud formation and rain. The study provides insights into the composition and behavior of the sun and stars, contributing to our understanding of their physical properties and evolution.
