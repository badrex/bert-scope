tldr: 'A Roman inscription found in Yorkshire in 1753 is analyzed by John Ward. The inscription is dedicated to Aurelius Macrinus, an equites singularis, a part of the Roman emperor's bodyguards. The discovery provides insight into the history of Roman cavalry and their role in the Roman Empire. The inscription is likely from the time of Emperor Severus, who resided in Britain for three years before his death in York.'
