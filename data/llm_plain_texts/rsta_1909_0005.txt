tldr: This article investigates the eutectic research of the lead-tin alloy system. The authors found that the composition of the eutectic alloy is different from previous findings, with 37% lead and 63% tin. They also discovered a transformation occurring in lead-rich alloys at temperatures below complete solidification. The study uses thermal analysis and cooling curves to determine the equilibrium of the lead-tin system and the properties of the eutectic alloy.
