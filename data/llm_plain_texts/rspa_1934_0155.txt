tldr: The authors studied the refractive dispersion of three oxygenated derivatives of cyclohexane, including cyclohexanol, cyclohexanone, and ethyl hexahydrobenzoate. They found that the Ketteler-Helmholtz equation is inadequate to explain the refractive dispersion of these compounds, and they discovered that the contribution of the ketonic absorption band to refractive dispersion is very small. This research provides a basis for understanding the phenomenon of optical exaltation in compounds containing conjugated double bonds.
