tldr: This study examines the feeding ecology of land birds on West Island, Aldabra Atoll, in the Indian Ocean. The research observes bird feeding activity in eight habitats and analyzes gizzard contents of birds from three species. The findings reveal that two species previously thought to be ecologically close actually have different feeding habits, while several other species share similar feeding stations and foods. The study also discusses seasonal food availability and the use of introduced vegetation and associated fauna and flora.
