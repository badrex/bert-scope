tldr: The authors conducted X-ray diffraction experiments on various plagioclase felspars to study their crystal structures. They discovered that these minerals form a complex series of isomorphous structures, with some having both albite and anorthite structures. The authors propose a model in which sheets with the albite structure and sheets with the anorthite structure alternate, providing a more accurate understanding of the plagioclase felspar group's properties.
