tldr: This article discusses the simultaneous variations of the barometer in India and explores the causes behind these changes. The author examines various hypotheses, such as aerial currents and vapor pressure, and concludes that these explanations do not fully account for the observed phenomena. The author proposes an alternative cause, related to the 26-day period of the sun's rotation, which may explain the variations in atmospheric pressure.
