tldr: The author investigates the role of phagocytes in the development of cerebro-spinal meningitis. They discovered that phagocytes, specifically polymorph leucocytes, are present in large numbers in spinal fluid during meningitis and can contain live meningococci. This suggests that phagocytes may play a role in spreading the infection. The author also discusses the susceptibility of the meningococcus to the toxic action of dilute sodium chloride solutions, which can be used to kill the bacteria outside of the phagocytes while protecting those inside.
