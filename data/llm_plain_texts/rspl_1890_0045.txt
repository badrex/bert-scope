tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate the possible role of micro-organisms in cancer development and growth. They found no growth of cancer cells in artificial culture media, but discovered that cancerous tissues showed distinct "budding" of both epithelial and connective-tissue cells. The authors also performed transplantation experiments on animals, but so far, the results have been negative.
