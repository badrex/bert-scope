tldr: The author studied the aurora spectrum of May 13-15, 1921, and conducted laboratory experiments to understand the nitrogen bands and their origin. The auroral sky was found to be richer in blue and violet rays than the ordinary night sky. The author also examined the discharge tube to study the atomic rays and their effect on the spectrum, comparing it with the auroral spectrum.
