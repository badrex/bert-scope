tldr: This article discusses the creep behavior of engineering materials, particularly concrete, and its application to the Earth's structure. It explores the mechanisms of creep, the factors affecting it, and the potential for predictive analysis in various situations. The article also highlights the importance of understanding the boundary value problem in planetary creep and the need for further research in this area.
