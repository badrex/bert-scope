tldr: The authors calculate theoretical intensities in the hydrogen spectrum using various methods, including the harmonic oscillator, Morse function, and eigenfunctions. They compare the results with experimental measurements and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each method. The study provides insights into the behavior of hydrogen atoms and the nature of their energy levels.
