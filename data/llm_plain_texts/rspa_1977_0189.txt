tldr: The article presents a stochastic theory of particle transport using a probability balance equation. The theory is applied to radiation damage cascades in a homogeneous medium and demonstrates how it can be used to calculate the mean, variance, and higher-order correlations of particle numbers in a given region of phase space. The connection between the forward and backward forms of the Boltzmann equation is also explored, providing insights into the behavior of particle systems.
