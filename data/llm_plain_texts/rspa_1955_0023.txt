tldr: The authors investigate the relative stability of cubic and hexagonal close-packed lattices in inert gas solids, using a Lennard-Jones potential. They find that the hexagonal lattice is more stable at the absolute zero, but a polymorphic transition to the cubic lattice is expected at elevated temperatures. This transition is consistent with experimental observations in solid helium. The authors conclude that non-central forces are responsible for the experimentally observed cubic close-packing in other inert gas solids.
