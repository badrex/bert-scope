tldr: This article presents a method for constructing bounds for the properties of nonlinear composite dielectrics using a nonlinear comparison medium and trial fields with the property of 'bounded mean oscillation.' The approach relies on the Hashin-Shtrikman methodology and can be applied to a wider range of nonlinear composite problems.
