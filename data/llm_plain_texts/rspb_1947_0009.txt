revised_title: 'Exploring the Relationship between Salt Action on Bacterial Respiration and Protein Solubility'
semantic_tags:
  - Bacterial respiration
  - Protein solubility
  - Salting-out
  - Enzyme activity
  - Halophilic organisms
tldr: The author investigates the relationship between the action of salts on bacterial respiration and their influence on protein solubility. They find that the rate of oxygen consumption by bacteria can be related to the salt concentration in the solution using a specific equation. This connection helps explain the mechanisms by which some organisms can survive in highly concentrated salt solutions.
