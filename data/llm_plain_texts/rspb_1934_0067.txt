tldr: This study examines the reproductive cycle of hedgehogs, specifically the anestrus period and the transition to the breeding season. The authors found that during anestrus, the reproductive organs of female hedgehogs show minimal activity, while male hedgehogs experience a pause in sperm production. The researchers also observed that environmental factors, such as captivity and temperature, can affect the reproductive cycle of hedgehogs.
