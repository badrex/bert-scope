tldr: The author investigates the Cauchy problem for perfect fluid space-times that evolve from a conformal singularity. They show that the evolution equations for the conformally transformed, unphysical geometry can be expressed as a first-order symmetric hyperbolic system. The study concludes that the 3-metric on the initial hypersurface of the unphysical spacetime constitutes the freely specifiable initial data. Under Penrose's Weyl Curvature Hypothesis, the physical spacetime is Robertson-Walker, which may provide a new explanation for the large-scale isotropy of the universe.
