tldr: This paper presents a theory of directed fluid sheets based on Cosserat surfaces, focusing on incompressible inviscid and linearly viscous fluid sheets. The authors develop a direct formulation for various two-dimensional flow problems and discuss aspects of wave propagation in water. They also apply the theory to study one-dimensional steady motion, hydraulic jumps, and other fluid sheet problems.
