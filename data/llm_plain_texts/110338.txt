tldr: The author, B. Phillips, presents experiments and findings to establish three propositions about bile secretion. These include the preexistence of bile principles in the blood, the liver's ability to secrete bile from both arterial and venous blood, and the formation of chyle without bile. The author concludes that bile secretion serves a purpose other than contributing to chyle formation.
