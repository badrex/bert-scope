tldr: This paper presents a theory explaining the resonance effects observed in ionograms taken by sounders above the ionosphere using the Alouette satellite. The authors analyze the electric field associated with a dipole oscillating in a uniform infinite plasma immersed in a uniform magnetic field, finding that resonances occur at the plasma frequency, electron cyclotron frequency, and hybrid frequency, or their harmonics. This research provides a fresh source of information about the ionosphere.
