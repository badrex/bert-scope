tldr: This article presents a new approach to study radio wave propagation over a sectionally homogeneous cylindrical surface. The author considers a two-dimensional problem of polarized radio waves traveling over two different sections of a circular cylindrical surface with distinct electrical characteristics. The study provides a sharper result than previous work and offers a flexible method that can be useful in similar problems.
