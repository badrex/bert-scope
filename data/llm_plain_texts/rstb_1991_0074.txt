tldr: This article explores the interaction between animals and plants in the context of herbivore gut structure and diet optimization. The authors use a theoretical model to analyze the efficiency of different gut structures and diets for higher vertebrate herbivores. They find that the optimal gut structure and diet depend on the quality and quantity of food consumed, and that herbivores often face a trade-off between eating fast and consuming richer food. The study suggests that ruminant herbivores have near-optimal gut structures for consuming poor-quality food, but may benefit from a smaller rumen and larger posterior fermentation chamber for richer food sources.
