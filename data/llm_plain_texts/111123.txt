tldr: This paper by Professor Owen examines the exogenous processes of vertebrae in various animals, including humans, and discusses their variations and adaptations. The author defines and proposes terms for different parts and processes of the vertebrae, and provides detailed descriptions and illustrations of these processes in numerous species. The study also explores the similarities and differences between mammal and reptile vertebrae, as well as the unique adaptations found in birds and extinct reptiles.
