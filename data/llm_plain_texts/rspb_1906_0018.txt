tldr: This study investigates the production and factors that determine the intraocular fluid in the eye. The researchers found that the intraocular fluid is produced by the ciliary processes and maintains the intraocular pressure. The fluid plays a crucial role in providing nourishment to the cornea, lens, and other eye structures. The study also discusses the methods used to measure intraocular pressure and the impact of blood pressure on the production of intraocular fluid.
