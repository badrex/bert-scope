tldr: The study investigates the ultrastructure and spermiogenesis of three cephalopoda decapoda species: Eusepia officinalis, Loligo forbesi, and Alloteuthis subulata. The research focuses on the modification of the spermatid cells into mature spermatozoa, the unique morphology of their sperm, and the membrane organization in the mid-piece region. The findings reveal similarities in the morphology of the three species and the use of the freeze-etching technique to study their membrane systems and condensed nuclei.
