tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the process of respiration and gas exchange in the human body. They discovered that when pure oxygen is inhaled, a portion of nitrogen (azote) is released from the blood. The authors also investigated the amount of air in the lungs after complete expiration and found that it is difficult to expel all the air from the lung cells. They then performed experiments on a Guinea pig to further study the gas exchange process.
