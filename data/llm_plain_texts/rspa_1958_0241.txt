tldr: The authors investigated the source of the alkali metal continuum in hydrogen flame gases. They found that the origin of the continuum lies in a radiative process involving alkali atoms and hydroxyl radicals. The results suggest that the process A + OH -> AOH + hv is the most likely source of the continuum in flame gases. This study has implications for understanding the behavior of alkali metals in flames and their potential use as a measure of concentration of hydroxyl.
