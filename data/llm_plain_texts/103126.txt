tldr: The author, Anthony van Leeuwenhock, conducted microscopical observations on the animalcula in the seminal fluid of young rams. He discovered that these tiny organisms can survive for up to 32 hours after the ram's death. This led him to conclude that these organisms could survive longer in the female's reproductive system, potentially taking 2-3 days to reach the part of the womb where they receive nourishment before the female is impregnated.
