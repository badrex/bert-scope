tldr: In this paper, Michael Faraday investigates the electrochemical decomposition of various substances using a voltaic pile. He discovers that the elements in a body that are strongly opposed to each other in their chemical affinities are most readily separated by the voltaic pile. Faraday also invents the voltaelectrometer, an instrument for measuring electric currents, based on the new law he discovered that the decomposing action of any current of electricity is constant for a constant quantity of electricity. This research is crucial for understanding the nature and extent of electrochemical decomposition and the development of electrochemical theories.
