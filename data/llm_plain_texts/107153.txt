tldr: In this article, William Hyde Wollaston describes his discovery of a new metal, rhodium, found in crude platina. He explains its properties, such as its insolubility in nitro-muriatic acid and its ability to form alloys with gold and silver. Rhodium is distinguished from other metals by its rose-colored solution and unique reactions with various reagents. Wollaston also discusses the presence of palladium in crude platina and its similarities to platina.
