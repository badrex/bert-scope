tldr: This study investigates the role of body fluids in the movement of soft-bodied invertebrates, specifically focusing on the siphon extension in Mya arenaria and Scrobicularia plana. The authors found that siphon extension is not caused by an influx of blood into the siphonal walls, but rather by water being forced into the cavities of the siphons. This discovery challenges the traditional belief that blood is responsible for transmitting pressure and causing changes of shape in mollusks.
