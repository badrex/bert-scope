tldr: The authors propose a new parametrization for the pair correlation function of a hard sphere fluid near a hard wall. The new parametrization is an interpolation between the Percus shielding approximation and the bulk pair correlation function, with a semi-empirical modification to satisfy the surface tension. The resulting pair correlation function is in good agreement with computer simulations and satisfies a sum rule for the slope of the density profile.
