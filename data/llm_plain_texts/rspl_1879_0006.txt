tldr: The authors conducted experiments on electrical discharges through rarefied gases and discovered that the luminous column produced by these discharges can be sensitive to the approach of a conductor. They found that the effects of a conductor on the discharge depend on its size, capacity, and proximity to the tube. The study of these phenomena led the authors to conclude that the discharges at the two terminals of a tube are independent and primarily determined by the conditions at their own terminal.
