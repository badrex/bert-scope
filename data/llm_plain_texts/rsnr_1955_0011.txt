tldr: In 1786, Dr. Michel-Gabriel Paccard and Jacques Balma became the first to ascend Mont Blanc, the highest peak in the Alps. Their achievement was initially slow to spread, but it marked a significant event in the history of mountaineering. Paccard's observations, including temperature and barometer readings, were crucial in calculating the height of Mont Blanc. This historical account examines Paccard's observations and their significance in the context of the time.
