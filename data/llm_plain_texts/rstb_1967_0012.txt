tldr: The study examines the bacterial and yeast flora of five lakes on Deception Island in Antarctica, focusing on their temperature characteristics and nutritional requirements. The research shows that the isolated bacteria are well adapted to the temperature regimes and nutritional environments of the Antarctic lakes, with many having optimum growth temperatures below 20°C. The findings contribute to understanding the microbial life in the Antarctic ecosystem.
