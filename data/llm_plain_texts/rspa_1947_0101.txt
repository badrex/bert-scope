tldr: The authors studied the far ultra-violet spectra of various benzene derivatives, focusing on compounds with side chains conjugated with the benzene ring. They observed different absorption patterns and discussed the effects of molecular conjugation and electronic transitions on the spectra. Their findings provide insights into the relationship between molecular structure and absorption spectra in organic compounds.
