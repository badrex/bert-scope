tldr: The author investigates the evolution of stars with decreasing mass, focusing on the first part of the main sequence. They propose that the main sequence is a result of stars with the same structure being formed at different times and in different parts of the galaxy. By considering the continuous decrease of a star's mass, the author explains the observed main sequence and the challenges faced by the theory of constant mass evolution.
