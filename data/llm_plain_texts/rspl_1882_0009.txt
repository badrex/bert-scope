tldr: This article discusses the determination of sextactic points of a curve using mathematical formulas and theorems. The author presents a method to calculate the degree of the equation involved and explains the process of reducing extraneous factors. The main interest lies in the application of algebraic geometry and the analysis of the curve's properties.
