tldr: In this article, John Walsh and Sieu Seignette explore the electric properties of the Torpedo, discovering that its effects are similar to electricity and can be transmitted through conductors. They also find that the Torpedo's electricity is not accompanied by sparks or attraction and repulsion, and that its action is stronger in air than in water.
