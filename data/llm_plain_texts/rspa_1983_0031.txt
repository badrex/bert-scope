tldr: This article explores the application of twistor diagrams to massless Compton scattering, a process in which a photon interacts with an electron. The author demonstrates how to translate complex integrals into simpler twistor diagrams, which can be used to represent the scattering amplitudes in a manifestly finite manner. The results justify the elegant diagrammatic formula originally written down by Penrose for this example.
