tldr: This article discusses various methods developed for processing electron micrographs to extract three-dimensional structural information from biological specimens. Techniques such as optical diffraction, Fourier transforms, and optical filtering are explored, along with three-dimensional reconstruction methods using Fourier synthesis. These methods help in understanding the arrangement and shape of macromolecules in biological specimens with high resolution.
