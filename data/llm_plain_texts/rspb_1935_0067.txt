tldr: 'Researchers discovered a new alkaloid called ergometrine in ergot, which can cause strong contractions of the human uterus. Ergometrine is a white crystalline substance with unique properties, such as its solubility in certain solvents and its stability when combined with ethyl acetate. The researchers also found that ergometrine is related to other ergot alkaloids, such as ergotocin and ergobasine, but has distinct properties and uses in medicine, particularly in obstetrics.'
