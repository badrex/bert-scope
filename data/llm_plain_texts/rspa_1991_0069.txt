tldr: The authors explore the possibility of mode mixing in surface waves, specifically in coupled capillary and dilational modes on a liquid surface. They demonstrate that the transverse shear surface viscosity is necessary for mode mixing to occur and discuss the implications of this phenomenon. The study provides a theoretical prediction of effects uniquely attributable to the surface viscosity, which could help settle the controversy surrounding its existence.
