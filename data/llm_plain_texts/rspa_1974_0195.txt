tldr: This article corrects a previous paper on unsteady convective diffusion with interphase mass transfer. The authors found that the corrected equations provide a better approximation to the original exact results for large dimensionless parameters and a wider range of values. The corrected figures show similar qualitative conclusions as the previous paper.
