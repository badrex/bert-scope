tldr: This article examines the formation and evolution of Earth's continental crust and marginal basins through geological time. It explores the various types of modern and Phanerozoic marginal basins and attempts to identify possible Proterozoic and Archaean analogues to assess their role in crustal development. The authors discuss the geological features of modern basins and how they can aid in recognizing ancient terrains. They also analyze the geochemistry of marginal basin basalts and the sedimentation history in these basins.
