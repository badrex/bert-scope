tldr: This article examines the influx rates of comets and asteroids to Earth, comparing the populations of Earth impacts with those in the comet cloud and asteroid belt. The authors analyze the distribution of impact craters, the age of the Earth's surface, and the relationship between cratering rate and geological time. They also discuss the energy of causative projectiles and the mass distribution index of incident objects.
