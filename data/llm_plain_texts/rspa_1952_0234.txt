tldr: This article investigates the relationship between friction and hardness in sliding metals, specifically copper-beryllium alloys. The authors found that friction is generally independent of hardness, but it is lower for harder metals. They explain this phenomenon through the breakdown of oxide films and the shearing of junctions between the sliding surfaces.
