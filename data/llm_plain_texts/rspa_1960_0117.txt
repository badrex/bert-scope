tldr: This article investigates the thermal properties of alkali halide crystals, specifically the inversion of heat capacity. The authors analyze the coefficients of low moments and their effect on the variation of negative moments in potassium chloride and potassium bromide. They propose two general analytical forms to describe the inversion phenomenon.
