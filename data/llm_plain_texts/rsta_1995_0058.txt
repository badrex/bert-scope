tldr: The article investigates singularities in solutions of the classical boundary-layer equations in three-dimensional steady hypersonic flow along a flat plate with surface roughness. It focuses on the breakdown of symmetry-plane flow and the development of singularities under varying pressure distributions. The study includes a wide parametric analysis, numerical methods, and analytical extensions to understand the behavior of boundary-layer thickness and skin friction components.
