tldr: The authors studied the graphitization of diamond at zero pressure and high pressure, measuring the rates of transformation and determining the activation energy and volume for the process. They found that the rate-controlling step in the graphitization of diamond surfaces is the detachment of a single carbon atom, which requires an activation energy of 3.5 eV for {111} surfaces and 2.5 eV for {110} surfaces. This low activation volume supports the single-atom process involved in graphitization.
