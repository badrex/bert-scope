tldr: The authors conducted experiments and theoretical calculations to study the transfer of vibrational energy between molecules in various gas mixtures. They found that near-resonant energy transfer between molecules with similar vibrational modes is efficient and plays a significant role in the relaxation of vibrational energy. The results provide insights into the complex collision processes and the efficiency of energy transfer between molecules.
