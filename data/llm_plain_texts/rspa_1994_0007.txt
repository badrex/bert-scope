tldr: This study presents a new one-dimensional model for predicting the induced air velocity within droplet-driven sprays. The model considers the mechanics of droplet and gas motion in liquid sprays and is compared with a two-dimensional axisymmetric model. The results are in good agreement with experimental measurements, providing a basis for optimizing nozzle designs and understanding environmental processes involving droplet ejection.
