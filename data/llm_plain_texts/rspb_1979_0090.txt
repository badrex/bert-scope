tldr: The study investigates the distribution, aggregation behavior, and rhythmicity of locomotory activity of the marine insect Halobates robustus in the Galapagos Islands. The insect was found in highest numbers on water surfaces near mangroves. The study found that the insect's aggregations can maintain a floating station in relation to the surrounding environment, regardless of tidal movements. The daily bimodal rhythm of encounters is triggered by dawn, suggesting an 'hour-glass' mechanism. The interactions between single adults, copulating pairs, and immature stages contribute to the overall pattern of activity.
