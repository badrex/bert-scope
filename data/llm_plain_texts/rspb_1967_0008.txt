tldr: The authors discovered that applying a hyperpolarizing or depolarizing pulse to a motor nerve ending during the falling phase of its action potential can suppress or potentiate transmitter release, respectively. They also found that the facilitating action of calcium on transmitter release can be studied by synchronizing the arrival of the nerve impulse with a rapid increment of the external calcium concentration. This research provides insights into the complex interactions between electrical signals and neurotransmitter release in nerve cells.
