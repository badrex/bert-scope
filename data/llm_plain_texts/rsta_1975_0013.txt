tldr: This article discusses the possibility that red dwarf stars and other flare stars could be the primary source of low-energy cosmic rays. The author compares the energy output of these stellar flares to the energy output of solar flares, which are known to produce low-energy cosmic rays. The author estimates that these stars could be the major source of galactic cosmic rays for energies from 10^9 to 10^12 electron volts and that type stars could contribute up to one fifth of the total cosmic-ray energy up to 1 GeV.
