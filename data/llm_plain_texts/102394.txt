tldr: The author, J. Hillier, writes about the customs, climate, and health conditions of Cape Corse in his letters to Dr. Bathurst. He describes the inhabitants' practices, including human sacrifices, and the local environment, which is characterized by hilly terrain, narrow valleys, and dense shrubs. Hillier also discusses the challenges of agriculture in the area due to the locals' laziness and lack of industry. He provides insights into the local diet, water quality, and the effects of the climate on health, including the prevalence of diseases and the impact of the air on the human body.
