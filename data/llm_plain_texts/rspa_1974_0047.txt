tldr: The photolysis and quenching of cis- and trans-hexa-1,3,5-triene and cyclohexa-1,3-diene were studied in the gas phase at various pressures and with added gases. The limiting quantum yield for hexatriene photolysis was found to be unity, and the pressure dependence of observed interconversions of isomers and benzene formation could be explained by reactions of vibrationally excited molecules produced by rapid internal conversion. The results provide insights into the photochemical behavior of these isomers and their photolysis products.
