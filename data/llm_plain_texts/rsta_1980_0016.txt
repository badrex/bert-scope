tldr: This article discusses the differences in the evolution of passive continental margins between the Bay of Biscay and the Rockall Plateau. The Bay of Biscay's margin is characterized by a series of tilted and rotated fault blocks, while the Rockall Plateau's margin has a more blurred continent-ocean transition. The differences in the margins are attributed to variations in the rifting process, crustal thickness, and tectonic history. The study uses multichannel seismic reflection profiles and deep sea drilling results to analyze the structural styles and evolution of these margins.
