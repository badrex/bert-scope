tldr: This study examines a hybrid zone between two karyotypic races of house mice in Scotland, characterized by different numbers of chromosomes. The researchers found a unique structure in the hybrid zone, with chromosomal clines not coinciding, leading to a staggered pattern. This finding has implications for understanding the dynamics of hybrid zones and gene flow between populations.
