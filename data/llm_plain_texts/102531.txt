tldr: The author, Francisco Redi, describes the process of extracting factitious salts from various plant materials and their unique shapes. He also discusses the purging properties of these salts and their potential use in medicine. The salts' shapes remain consistent even when dissolved and re-solidified, and some have multiple shapes. The author also notes that different plant parts can yield different salts.
