tldr: 'The article discusses the long-term effects of man-made chemicals on the environment and human health. It highlights the importance of record linkage, a powerful tool that allows the correlation of exposure indicators with biological effects, even after long periods. The author suggests two ways to use record linkage techniques to identify substances with long-term toxic effects: tracking women employed during pregnancy and following workers in manufacturing industries. The author emphasizes the need for better data organization and improved access to appropriate data for monitoring long-term toxic substances in humans.'
