tldr: The study investigates the distribution and morphology of indoleamine-accumulating and displaced bipolar cells in the turtle retina. Indoleamine-accumulating bipolar cells were selectively labeled with 5,6-Dihydroxytryptamine, and their density was found to be highest in the visual streak. Displaced bipolar cells, with at least two subtypes, were also analyzed for their density and distribution in the retina.
