tldr: Researchers discovered that small particles found in the calyx of a parasitoid, Nemeritis, help the eggs avoid encapsulation by their insect host, Ephestia. By applying these particles to the surface of other objects, they found that they could prevent encapsulation, suggesting that the particles alone are responsible for the resistance. This finding provides insight into the complex interactions between parasites and their hosts and may have implications for controlling pest populations.
