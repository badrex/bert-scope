revised_title: 'Microinjection of Calcium and its Effects on Aequorin'
semantic_tags:
  - Calcium ionophoresis
  - Aequorin
  - Photoprotein
  - Calcium transport
  - Light emission
tldr: The authors microinjected calcium ions into droplets of the photoprotein aequorin to study the relationship between ionophoretic current and light intensity. They found that the amplitude and rate of rise of the light emitted were directly proportional to the ionophoretic current. Increasing the concentration of aequorin led to a proportional increase in the amplitude of the light responses. The study provides a basis for comparison with similar injections into squid axons.
