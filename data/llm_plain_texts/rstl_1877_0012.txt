tldr: The author presents a geometric and analytical study of the bicircular quartic, a curve generated by a generating circle cutting at right angles a circle of inversion and a dirigent conic. The author establishes monomial equations for the bicircular quartic and the relations between the parameters, providing a complete analytical theory and further developing the transformation to elliptic integrals.
