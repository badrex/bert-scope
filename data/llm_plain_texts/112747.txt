tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the reaction between sodium and acetic ether. They discovered that the evolution of hydrogen gas occurs during the reaction, and they discussed the effects of pressure on the reaction. The authors also compared their findings with those of other researchers, such as Mr. Wanklyn, and provided a detailed analysis of the differences in their results.
