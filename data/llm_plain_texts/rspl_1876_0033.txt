tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the physico-chemical theory of fermentation and the conditions that favor archebiosis in previously boiled fluids. They discovered that neutral or slightly alkaline organic fluids are more prone to undergo fermentation than slightly acidic fluids. The author also found that heat and oxygen play a significant role in promoting fermentation, and that adding liquor potassae to boiled urine increases its fermentability. These findings contribute to the ongoing discussion about the origin of fermentations and the role of living organisms or germs in the process.
