tldr: This article investigates the flexure of telescope mirror-discs caused by their weight and its impact on resolving power. The authors calculate the distortion for various support methods and analyze how it affects the resolving power of the instrument. They determine whether the critical size of aperture is practically attainable in the construction of large mirrors.
