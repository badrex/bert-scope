tldr: This article discusses the release of function in the nervous system, particularly in cases of hemiplegia. It highlights the distinction between loss of function and positive outbursts of excessive activity in nervous diseases. The authors attribute these positive symptoms to the loss of voluntary power, which allows for negative conditions to permit positive symptoms to appear.
