tldr: The authors conducted a chemical analysis of various types of pearls, including British, Australian, and Ceylonese, and found that they all had the same composition: water, organic matter, and calcium carbonate. They discovered that pearls have a different composition than mother-of-pearl, containing less water and more organic matter. The authors also discussed the hardness and solubility of pearls, explaining that they are denser and harder than mother-of-pearl and are not easily dissolved in vinegar.
