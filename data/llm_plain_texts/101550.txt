tldr: The author, Nathaniel Fairfax, shares observations about insects and their inoxiousness in a letter to the publisher. He discusses how creatures considered venomous are not poisonous when swallowed and provides examples of people who have consumed spiders and toads without harm. He also mentions an experiment where a spider changes the color of water when bruised, suggesting that insects can have color-changing abilities.
