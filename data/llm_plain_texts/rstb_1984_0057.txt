tldr: 'This article discusses the meteorological factors influencing the dispersion and deposition of pollutants, focusing on anthropogenic sulphur and nitrogen compounds. It examines the challenges of modeling deposition and the role of atmospheric chemistry in the oxidation of these compounds. The authors also present the complexity of factors determining the acidity of rain and its ecological effects on various regions in Europe.'
