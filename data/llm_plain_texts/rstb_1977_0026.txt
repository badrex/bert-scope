tldr: This study examines the variation in the spire index of coiled gastropod shells and its evolutionary significance. The spire index measures the shape of the shell and is found to have bimodal distributions in various gastropod groups. The authors suggest that shell shape may be related to the positions in which different species normally walk and their preferred feeding places, which could explain the observed distribution patterns. The findings support the idea that these distributions are explicable by natural selection.
