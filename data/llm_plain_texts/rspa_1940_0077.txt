tldr: Austen and Whitehead conducted experiments to determine the intrinsic electric strength of solid dielectrics and the effects of temperature, thickness, and crystal structure on their electric strength. Their experimental methods and results were compared with Frohlich's theory of electronic breakdown, showing that the theory agrees with their findings for certain crystals but not for complex organic dielectrics or when specific limits are exceeded.
