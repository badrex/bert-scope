revised_title: On the Analysis of Cubics and Their Inflexions
semantic_tags:
  - Algebraic Geometry
  - Cubic Curves
  - Inflexion Points
  - Cayleyan Curves

tldr: This article discusses the properties of cubic curves, their inflexion points, and the methods for constructing them. The authors explore the relationship between the cubic, its Hessian, and Cayleyan curves, and how these curves are affected by the variation in the original cubic. They also present special cases, such as equian-harmonic cubics, and demonstrate their properties using various constructions and diagrams.
