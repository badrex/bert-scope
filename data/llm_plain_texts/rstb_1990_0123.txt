tldr: This article is dedicated to Dr. Reginald Rainey, a pioneer in the study of migrant pests and their interactions with weather patterns. His work focused on understanding how wind patterns and atmospheric conditions influence the migration, distribution, and population dynamics of various insect pests. Rainey's research had significant implications for pest management and highlighted the importance of considering the atmospheric environment in understanding insect population behavior.
