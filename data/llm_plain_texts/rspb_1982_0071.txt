tldr: 'This study investigates the effects of intracellular pH on calcium currents in Paramecium caudatum. The results show that intracellular alkalinization enhances the early calcium current, while acidification depresses it. These changes in calcium currents lead to a conversion of graded responses to all-or-none action potentials. The findings suggest that calcium channel permeability is blocked by intracellular protonation of a single titratable site.'
