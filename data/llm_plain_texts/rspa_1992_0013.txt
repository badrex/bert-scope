tldr: The author presents a formulation for anisotropy in diffusional creep, focusing on the effect of grain shape and the role of grain boundary sliding. The study examines the rate of creep under multiaxial stresses for both lattice and grain boundary diffusion. The results are compiled in the form of 'creep compliance matrices,' providing a complete description of the effect of grain shape on creep anisotropy in response to any stress system.
