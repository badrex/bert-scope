tldr: 'This study examines the oestrous cycle in albino mice, using vaginal smear analysis to identify different stages of the cycle. The research also explores the effects of copulation, X-ray sterilization, and various environmental conditions on the duration of the di-oestrous period. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the reproductive biology of mice and other mammals.'
