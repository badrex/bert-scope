tldr: The author explores the precession of a viscous spheroid and its effects on the Earth's history. They consider the influence of an annular satellite on the change of obliquity and tidal friction. The study also includes the impact of the Earth's and Moon's tides on their orbits and the consequences of Earth's contraction due to cooling.
