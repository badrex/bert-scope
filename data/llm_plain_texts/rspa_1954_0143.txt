tldr: This study investigates the coherent scattering of light in binary liquid mixtures near the critical mixing point, known as critical opalescence. The authors measured the apparent extinction of the incident light beam and the angular distribution of scattered light intensity over a wide range of wavelengths in the visible and ultra-violet region and a range of temperatures above the critical point for nine selected liquid mixtures. The results showed two distinct classes with specific temperature and wavelength dependencies, and an asymmetric angular distribution of scattered light. This research provides a deeper understanding of the mechanisms behind critical fluctuations in binary liquid mixtures.
