tldr: The author discusses the observed deviations of the compass in various ships, both wood-built and iron-built, and provides a method to analyze and correct these deviations. The main idea is to separate the deviations into two systems: polar-magnet-deviation and quadrantal deviation. By using tables and simple rules, one can determine the elements of the deviations and correct them accordingly. The author also emphasizes the importance of not relying on a single table of compass-deviations and instead using magnets and soft iron to correct the compass.
