tldr: The authors analyzed the Linton tetrapod assemblage, a famous Upper Carboniferous fossil deposit in Ohio, and developed a depositional model for its formation. They found that the fossils are preserved in an allochthonous organic filling of an abandoned river channel. This model can be applied to other Coal Measure vertebrate localities in Europe, suggesting that environmental models combined with geological controls can help locate more fossiliferous deposits. The Linton deposit is a result of an organic infilling of a deep and sinuous abandoned channel, and similar deposits have been found in other coal fields.
