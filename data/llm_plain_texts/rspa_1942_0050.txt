tldr: This article presents a method for calculating the elastic constants of metals using the Fock-Dirac equations and perturbation theory. The authors apply this method to a cyclic lattice and find that their results are in satisfactory agreement with observed values. The study provides a foundation for understanding the mechanical properties of metals and their response to deformation.
