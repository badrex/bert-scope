tldr: The authors investigated the thermal decomposition of tert-butyl hydroperoxide and the effects of added oxygen and acetone on the reaction products. They found that the major part of methyl ethyl ketone formed from tert-butyl hydroperoxide is produced via further reactions of acetone. This study provides valuable information on the probable mechanism of ketone formation and helps assess the extent of hydroperoxide participation in hydrocarbon combustion.
