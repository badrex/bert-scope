tldr: The authors studied the petrology and tectonics of the Mid-Indian Ocean Ridge, focusing on the block structure and processes that create it. They found that the structure of the crust consists of different blocks of various origins, including peridotites, serpentinized harzburgites, gabbro, and basalt. The authors suggest that the uprise of deep material from the upper mantle forms the block structure, leading to the spreading of the ocean floor and continental drift. They also discuss the different types of metamorphism and the role of protrusions in creating the rift zone's structure.
