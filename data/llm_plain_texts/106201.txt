tldr: This article describes the delivery of a unique acephalous monster, a rare birth where the child had no head, neck, hands, or arms. The monster's anatomy is examined, revealing its small and tender bones, irregularly formed and sized toes, and the absence of vital organs such as the brain, spinal marrow, heart, lungs, and liver. The article also discusses the circulation of blood in the monster's body without a heart and the various opinions of physiologists and philosophers on the causes of such anomalies.
