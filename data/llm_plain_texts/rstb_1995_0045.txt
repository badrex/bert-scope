tldr: This article explores the use of molecular dynamics computer simulations to study protein unfolding and stability. The authors investigate the effects of various driving forces, such as temperature, pressure, and solvent changes, on the stability of four different proteins. The results provide insights into protein instability and possible unfolding pathways, which are compared to experimental data when available.
