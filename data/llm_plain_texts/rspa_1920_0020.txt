tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the refractivity and dispersion of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and methane gases. They found that the refractivities of these gases varied widely, and the dispersion values were not consistent with the additive law. This suggests that the forces controlling the motion of electrons in atoms are affected by the proximity of other atoms in a molecule. The research provides data for testing theories of atomic structure that explain optical phenomena.
