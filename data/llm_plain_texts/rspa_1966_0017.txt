tldr: The authors conducted a detailed analysis of the crystal and molecular structure of coronene using X-ray diffraction. They found that the carbon-carbon bond lengths vary in different parts of the molecule and confirmed the accuracy of previous two-dimensional measurements. The study provides a better understanding of the structure and properties of coronene, an aromatic hydrocarbon with potential applications in materials science and chemistry.
