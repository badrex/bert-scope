tldr: The authors conducted experiments on rabbit sino-atrial node cells to study the ionic currents underlying pacemaker activity. They found that the decay of potassium current and the activation of inward currents contribute to pacemaker depolarization. The results were confirmed using computer simulations, which helped clarify and extend the experimental findings.
