  - Microstructure
tldr: The authors conducted an experiment on a single crystal of aluminium under alternating torsional stresses while immersed in a slow stream of tap water. They observed three main features of the microstructure: general attack, local attack, and slip bands. The study aimed to understand the changes in microstructure during corrosion-fatigue tests and correlate them with the fine structure of the material.
