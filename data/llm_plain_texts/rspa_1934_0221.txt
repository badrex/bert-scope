tldr: The authors studied the catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide by ferrous and ferric salts, discovering that it is both a chain and a radical reaction. They found that varying concentrations of reactants alter the chain length and favor different ways of ending the chains, resulting in various products. The authors also examined the effects of acidity and the role of the anion in the reaction.
