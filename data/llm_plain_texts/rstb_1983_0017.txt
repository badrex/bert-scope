tldr: This study examines the morphology, behavior, and vascular system of the gastropod species Chilina fluctuosa, providing insights into the early evolution of pulmonate gastropods. The research focuses on the animal's ability to burrow and adapt to freshwater habitats, as well as the development of the pallial complex and its role in holding water and air. The findings support the idea that pulmonate gastropods evolved from marine prosobranch ancestors and that their adaptation to freshwater environments involved changes in morphology and behavior.
