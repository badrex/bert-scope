tldr: The authors studied the process of membrane turnover in rod photoreceptors and discovered that the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells extend pseudopodia to engulf and phagocytose the outer segment distal tips of rod photoreceptors. This process is essential for disc shedding and maintaining the health of the photoreceptor cells.
