tldr: This article presents a decade-long study of seasonal variations in daylight using photoelectric measurements. The author, W.R.G. Atkins, records the changes in vertical illumination and illumination integral from 1930 to 1937, providing valuable data for understanding the relationship between sunlight and environmental factors such as plankton growth in the English Channel. The study highlights the importance of accurate and consistent measurements for understanding these seasonal changes and their impact on various ecosystems.
