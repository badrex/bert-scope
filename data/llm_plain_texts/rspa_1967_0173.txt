tldr: This article investigates the exciton structure and absorption edge in hexagonal zinc selenide crystals. The authors discovered three exciton series and determined their binding energies and effective masses. They also studied the effects of crystal thickness, strain, impurities, and temperature on the absorption spectra and exciton properties. The findings contribute to the understanding of the optical properties of semiconducting compounds and the band structure of hexagonal zinc selenide.
