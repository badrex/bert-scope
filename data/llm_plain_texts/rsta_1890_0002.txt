tldr: The authors conducted a magnetic survey of the British Isles, collecting data at 243 stations to determine the secular changes in the direction of magnetic lines. They used instruments like the Kew magnetometer and dip circle to measure magnetic declination, force, and dip. The survey aimed to improve the distribution of stations and the number of declination observations, addressing local and regional disturbances and providing a more accurate representation of the magnetic field.
