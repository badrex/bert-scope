tldr: The study investigates the interaction between ipsilateral spinal reflexes acting on the flexor muscles of the hind-limb. It reveals that reflex interaction is evident in every instance and between every nerve-pair tried, with the form of interaction varying for different nerve pairs. The research also discovers a restricted ipsilateral flexor inhibition, which is a departure from the broad rule that ipsilateral hind-limb reflexes are excitatory and not inhibitory to the flexor muscles.
