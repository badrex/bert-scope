tldr: The author, J. A. Fleming, describes his experiments with a vacuum valve that can convert electric oscillations into continuous currents. This device, consisting of a carbon filament and a metal cylinder, can rectify electric oscillations and make them measurable on an ordinary galvanometer. Fleming demonstrates various applications of this device, including detecting electrical oscillations in open circuits and wireless communication.
