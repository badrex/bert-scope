tldr: The study investigates the effects of dopamine and serotonin neurotoxins, 6-hydroxydopamine and 5,6-dihydroxytryptamine, on the feeding system of the snail Lymnaea stagnalis. The neurotoxins were found to inhibit feeding responses and reduce serotonin and dopamine levels in the snail's neural tissue. These results suggest that monoamines play an important role in the initiation and maintenance of the feeding response in snails.
