tldr: The author examines the effects of changes in the colligative properties of the suspending medium on the anaerobic heat production of bull spermatozoa. The study found that abnormal environmental conditions or treatments, such as washing, hypertonicity, hypotonicity, and dilution, elicited a shock reaction characterized by depressed metabolism, followed by a gradual recovery or adaptation. The results suggest that the rate of anaerobic heat production declines before substrate exhaustion or a reduction in the concentration of the medium affects sperm metabolism.
