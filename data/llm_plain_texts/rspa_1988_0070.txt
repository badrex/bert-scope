tldr: This article investigates a simple model for sustained oscillations in isothermal branched-chain or autocatalytic reactions in a well-stirred open system. The authors explore multiple stationary states and Hopf bifurcations, finding a remarkable range of complexity in the dynamical behavior of the model. The study reveals similarities with oscillations observed in real chemical systems, such as the oxidations of hydrogen or carbon monoxide, and has implications for understanding and controlling chemical reactions.
