tldr: The article discusses the importance of transcriptional repression in the Drosophila embryo for establishing patterns of gene expression during embryogenesis. It presents evidence for two distinct modes of repression: 'quenching,' where a repressor works over short distances to block neighboring activators within a target enhancer, and'silencing,' where a silencer inactivates all enhancers within a complex promoter. These mechanisms play essential roles in converting the maternal regulatory gradients into territories of tissue differentiation.
