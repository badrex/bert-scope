tldr: The authors conducted a computer experiment to study ionic recombination in an ambient gas, taking into account binary recombination. They found that the recombination coefficient for ambient gas (termolecular) recombination follows the quasi-equilibrium statistical method in low-density regions and the Langevin-Harper formula in high-density regions. The Natanson formula, which was introduced to bridge the gap between these regions, was found to be unsuccessful.
