tldr: In a letter to Sir Justinian Isham, John Templer describes his observations on a boy's method of catching carps by tickling them under their gills. He also notes that carps tend to stay in shoals and can be easily caught when the water temperature is warm. This method can be applied to larger ponds and may be useful for managing fish populations in aquaculture.
