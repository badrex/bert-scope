tldr: The author investigates the biochemistry of fluoroacetate poisoning and isolates a fluorotricarboxylic acid inhibitor of citrate metabolism. They use infrared examination to study the properties of the inhibitor and provide evidence that the compound is barium fluoro-citrate. This research helps to understand the mechanism of fluoroacetate poisoning and the effects on citrate metabolism.
