tldr: This article discusses a supplement to a previous memoir on skew variation, introducing new frequency curve types and analyzing their properties. The author proposes an improved criterion for identifying these curve types and demonstrates their application to actual statistical data. The new curve types provide a more comprehensive understanding of frequency distributions and contribute to the study of evolutionary theory.
