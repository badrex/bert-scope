tldr: This paper analyzes 177 magnetic storms recorded by the magnetic instruments in the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, from 1841 to 1857. The author investigates the effects of these storms on Earth's magnetic field and discusses the possible causes, such as solar activity. The study reveals that the disturbances are not caused by definite galvanic currents or magnets but may be due to currents in a "magnetic ether" near the Earth, influenced by the sun.
