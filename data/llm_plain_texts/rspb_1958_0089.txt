tldr: Researchers used high-power radar to detect bird migration patterns. They found that the radar frequently picked up echoes from migrating birds, especially passerine birds. The study showed that the heaviest angel activity occurred in anticyclonic weather with light winds. The radar technology helped track the birds' speed and direction, providing valuable insights into bird migration patterns.
