tldr: This article explores the limiting behavior of atomic wave functions for large atomic numbers. The authors calculate the limiting slope of the screening number as a function of the mean radius for various configurations, enabling more accurate interpolation and estimation of wave functions. The study focuses on configurations with outer groups of 1s2 and 1s2 2s2 2p6, providing valuable insights into atomic structure and potential applications to larger atoms.
