tldr: The author, Henry Bence Jones, investigated the variations in the alkaline and earthy phosphates in urine and the alkalescence of urine from fixed alkali. He found that the quantity of earthy phosphates in urine after eating is greater than in fasting states. The alkaline phosphates are present in the highest quantity when consuming bread alone. Exercise has little effect on the earthy phosphates but increases the amount of alkaline phosphates. The author also discovered two types of alkalescent urine: one from the presence of carbonate of ammonia and the other from fixed alkali, which may cause turbid or clear urine. The study provides insights into the acid-base balance and nutritional influences on urine composition.
