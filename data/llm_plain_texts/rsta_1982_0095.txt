  - Stored-energy functions
tldr: The article investigates a class of singular solutions in nonlinear elasticity where a hole forms in the interior of an elastic body under tension, a phenomenon known as cavitation. The study focuses on discontinuous equilibrium solutions and the conditions under which they occur, using the direct method of the calculus of variations. The findings have implications for understanding the behavior of materials like rubber and the initiation of cavitation in fluids.
