tldr: This study investigates the methods of analyzing experimental data obtained from fracture mechanics tests on uniaxial fiber-polymer composites. The research focuses on four different test configurations and identifies various factors that need to be considered to obtain accurate values of interlaminar fracture energies. The findings can be applied to three different fiber-polymer composites with different types of fracture behavior.
