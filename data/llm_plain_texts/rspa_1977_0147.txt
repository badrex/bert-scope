tldr: This study investigates the fracture properties of WC-Co alloys, which consist of tungsten carbide particles embedded in a cobalt matrix. The authors use the double torsion method to evaluate the stress intensity factor for cracks propagating in a controlled manner. They find that cracks predominantly propagate through the cobalt matrix and develop a theory of fracture based on experimental data and quantitative analysis.
