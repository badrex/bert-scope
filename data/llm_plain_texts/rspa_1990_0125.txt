tldr: The author presents an energetically consistent theory for rigid body collisions with friction, focusing on the dynamics of partly elastic collisions and the role of frictional and indentation forces. The theory separates the collision process into compression and restitution phases, considering the effects of slip, slip reversal, and energy dissipation due to friction and internal inelastic behavior. This approach contrasts with Newton's impact law and Poisson's hypothesis, which can yield erroneous results when slip stops or changes direction during a non-collinear collision.
