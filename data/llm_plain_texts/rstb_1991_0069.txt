tldr: This article discusses the importance of biotic pollination and seed dispersal in the success of angiosperms. The authors argue that while these factors have been considered crucial, other traits such as rapid growth and reproduction rates have played a more significant role in the dominance of angiosperms. They also criticize the assumption that wind pollination is inefficient, and that biotic gene dispersal is an angiosperm-specific trait, as there is evidence of pre-angiosperm insect pollination and seed dispersal.
