tldr: 'This study investigates the relationship between chest plumage, fluctuating asymmetry, and dominance in female starlings. The researchers found that dominance is influenced by the number of spots on the chest, but not by spot asymmetry. Birds with spottier chests were dominant over birds with experimentally decreased spot number. The authors suggest that spottier chests may be a better indicator of quality than asymmetry due to their potential costs, such as increased susceptibility to abrasion.'
