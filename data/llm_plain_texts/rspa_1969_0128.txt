tldr: The authors developed a method to measure velocity by applying schlieren-interferometry to Doppler-shifted laser light. This technique can be used to measure the velocity of various phase objects, such as moving grids, ultrasonics, flames, and particles. The method is based on the Doppler-Schlieren principle, which involves observing a beat frequency when a Doppler-shifted beam interferes with a reference wave. The technique has advantages in measuring velocity due to its non-interfering nature and the use of a beat wave as a convenient and accurate 'clock'.
