tldr: This article investigates the structure of wind and evaporation in a turbulent atmosphere. The authors develop a mathematical model to describe the diffusion of mass, heat, and momentum in a turbulent medium, and apply it to the study of wind and evaporation. They find that the rate of evaporation is primarily affected by the mean velocity and height, and suggest that the air's water content, temperature, and roughness of the surface play a role in the wind structure.
