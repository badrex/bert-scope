tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the polarization of X-rays and their ability to excite high-velocity cathode rays. They used an apparatus with ionization chambers and analyzed the primary beam for polarization. The results showed that the efficiency of polarized rays in exciting cathode rays was different from non-polarized rays, and the authors discussed the implications of these findings.
