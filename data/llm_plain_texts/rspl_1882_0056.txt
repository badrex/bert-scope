tldr: Schorlemmer and Thorpe investigated the constitution of heptane in the resinous exudation from Pinus Sabiniana. They converted the heptane into a mixture of chlorides and transformed them into primary and secondary alcohols. The analysis of silver salts proved that the heptane yielded primary heptyl alcohol and methyl-pentyl-carbinol. The results provide further evidence that when chlorine acts on a normal paraffin, only the primary and secondary chlorides are formed.
