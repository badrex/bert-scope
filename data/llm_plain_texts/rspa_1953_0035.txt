tldr: The authors present a self-consistent method for obtaining wave functions of homonuclear diatomic molecules, focusing on electrical polarizability as a criterion. They analyze the influence of electron correlation and hybridization on polarizability and apply the method to nitrogen molecules. The study highlights the importance of accurate descriptions of the outer regions of molecules for polarizability calculations.
