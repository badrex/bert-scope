tldr: 'This article explains the mathematical methods used to reconstruct the stature of prehistoric races based on the measurements of bones and organs. The author, Karl Pearson, demonstrates the importance of using the theory of correlation and regression to predict the dimensions of organs in extinct races from the measurements of an extant allied race. The article also discusses the limitations and accuracy of the reconstruction process.'
