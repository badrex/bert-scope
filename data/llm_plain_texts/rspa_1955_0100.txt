tldr: This article investigates the distribution of temperature and other physical characteristics in electrically heated filaments. It calculates the end-loss corrections for various properties, such as electrical resistance, energy generation, and total radiation output, which are important for evaluating the performance of heated filaments in different applications. The results are applicable to tungsten filaments and can be used for high-frequency power tubes and sealed-in filament lamps.
