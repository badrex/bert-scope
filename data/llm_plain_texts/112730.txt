tldr: The author developed a method to measure the heating powers of stars, specifically Arcturus and a Lyrae, using a telescope and a pile of antimony and bismuth plates. They found that Arcturus produced more heat than a Lyrae, which they attributed to the difference in their spectral absorption. This research helped improve our understanding of the properties of these stars and the technology used to observe them.
