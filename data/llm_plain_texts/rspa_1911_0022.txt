tldr: The authors conducted experiments with vapours of alkali metals, specifically sodium and rubidium, to study their dispersion and absorption spectra. They discovered that certain conclusions could be drawn about the number of systems participating in light absorption. The authors also found that the dispersion effects can be detected even in the first members of the series and that the ratios of certain constants for a pair of lines were approximately constant throughout the series.
