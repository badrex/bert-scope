revised_title: Water Structure and Protein Solvation in Biology
semantic_tags:
  - Protein structure
  - Hydration interactions
  - Solvation effects
  - Water structure
  - Protein stability
tldr: This article discusses the importance of water structure and solvation interactions in maintaining protein conformation and stability. It explores the concepts of the A shell and B shell, which represent different levels of water interactions with proteins. The article also examines various experimental techniques and methods to study these interactions, such as X-ray diffraction, proton magnetic resonance, and differential scanning calorimetry. The significance of these interactions in understanding protein folding, stability, and function is emphasized throughout the article.
