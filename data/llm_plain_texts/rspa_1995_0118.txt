tldr: This article discusses the limitations of current one-point turbulence models and proposes a new approach to model rapidly deformed homogeneous turbulence. The authors argue that the Reynolds stresses alone are insufficient for predicting Reynolds stresses in nonequilibrium turbulent flows and introduce additional one-point tensors to overcome this deficiency. They develop a new linear model that captures some features of rapidly rotated anisotropic turbulence but ultimately conclude that a more complicated nonlinear model is necessary.
