tldr: This article discusses the effects of water stress on plant growth and the role of osmotic adjustment as a mechanism for coping with water shortage. It highlights the sensitivity of cell growth to water stress and the importance of understanding the physicochemical basis for the transduction of small changes in water status into alterations in metabolism. The article also examines recent field data on seasonal and diurnal adjustments and vertical water-potential gradients in plant canopies.
