revised_title: The Charge of an Electron: A New Approach
semantic_tags:

  - Electric Charge
tldr: The author proposes a new approach to understanding the charge of an electron by considering Fermi-Dirac statistics as a fundamental aspect of electric charge rather than a separate interaction. This approach simplifies the representation of electron pairs and provides a new perspective on the relationship between electric charge and quantum mechanics.
