tldr: The author, John Simon, examines the thyroid gland's comparative anatomy in various vertebrates, including mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish. He finds that the gland is universally present in mammals and birds but varies in presence and structure among reptiles and fish. The thyroid gland maintains a relationship with the vascular supply of the brain and is dependent on the existence of another organ, which may be a supplementary gill in some fish.
