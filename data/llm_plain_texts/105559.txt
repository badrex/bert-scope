tldr: James Ferguson invented a new hygrometer that measures the moisture content in the air. The device works by using a wooden panel that expands and contracts based on the humidity, which is then converted into a reading on a scale. This innovation improved the accuracy of measuring humidity and was useful for meteorological studies.
