tldr: The authors present a quantum electrodynamic theory for induced circular dichroism in chiral and achiral molecules. They calculate the time-dependent pairwise interactions between the molecules and show how two alternative canonical transformations of the Hamiltonian can simplify the results and provide better physical insight. The study focuses on the absorption rates of left- and right-handed circularly polarized light by achiral molecules in the presence of chiral molecules.
