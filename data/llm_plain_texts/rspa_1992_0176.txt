tldr: The authors study the slow dynamics of the Cahn-Hilliard equation in one space dimension, focusing on the evolution of transition layers in a binary alloy. They use energy-type estimates to show that as the kinetic coefficient approaches zero, the transition points move slower than any power of the coefficient. This research contributes to understanding the slow motion of interfaces in phase separation and coarsening processes.
