tldr: 'This article explores the role of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) in controlling cell growth and differentiation in Dictyostelium discoideum. PKA is essential for both prespore and spore gene expression, and it acts to regulate the action of DIF in stalk cell differentiation. PKA is also necessary for the morphogenetic movement of prestalk cells during culmination. The study suggests the existence of a signaling mechanism that converts the progressive signal into discrete, PKA-regulated gene activation events.'
