tldr: This article investigates the fatigue damage mechanisms and fatigue-life diagrams in composite materials. It reviews the basic damage mechanisms in composite laminates and proposes a pattern in the fatigue-life diagrams based on these mechanisms. The article also defines fatigue ratio and shows that a fatigue limit exists for unidirectional, cross-plied, and angle-plied laminates. It discusses the limitations to the fatigue performance of composite laminates and suggests ways to improve their fatigue resistance.
