tldr: This study investigates the induction phases in photosynthesis and their impact on the process's mechanism. The researchers found that there is an induction period during which the rate of photosynthesis increases. They also discovered that the induction period is not affected by the atmosphere of the apparatus during illumination, the movement of chloroplasts, or the temperature of the plant material. The study focused on the relationship between the induction period and the intensity of illumination and temperature.
