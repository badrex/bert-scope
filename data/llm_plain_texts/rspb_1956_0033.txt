tldr: The study investigates the nutritive value of white and wholemeal bread protein in relation to the growth of rats. It concludes that the difference in growth-promoting efficiency between the two types of bread is due to the higher lysine content in wholemeal bread. The research also shows that weanling rats are sensitive to changes in lysine concentration in their diets.
