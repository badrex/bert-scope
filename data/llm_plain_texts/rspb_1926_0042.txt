tldr: The author investigates the role of maturing follicles in the regulation of the oestrous cycle and hormonal control. They found that the maturing follicle plays a crucial role in the onset of oestrus, and that X-ray sterilization can destroy Graafian follicles, inhibiting the oestrous cycle. This research supports the theory that the maturing follicle is responsible for the production of a hormone causing heat and is essential for the regulation of the oestrous cycle.
