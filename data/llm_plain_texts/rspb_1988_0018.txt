tldr: The article describes a calcium-independent chloride current activated by hyperpolarization in Xenopus oocytes. The current is carried mainly by chloride ions and is different from the calcium-dependent transient chloride current. The findings provide insights into the diverse ionic currents in oocytes and their potential functions in development.
