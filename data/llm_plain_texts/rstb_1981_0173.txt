  - Gonadotropin secretion

tldr: This article discusses the regulation of gonadotropin secretion in the anterior pituitary, focusing on the distribution and availability of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptors and the two main gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). The study examines the cellular mechanisms underlying the variations in pituitary responsiveness to GnRH during the reproductive cycle and the role of GnRH receptors in regulating gonadotropin release.
