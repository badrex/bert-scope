tldr: The authors used Lord Rayleigh's method of jet-vibration to determine the surface tension of water. They supplemented the theoretical part of the investigation with corrections for the influence of finite amplitudes and viscosity. The experiments showed that the surface tension of water at 12°C is 73.23 dynes/cm.
