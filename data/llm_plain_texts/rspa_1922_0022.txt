revised_title: 'X-ray Spectra and Their Implications in Atomic Structure'
semantic_tags:
  - X-ray spectroscopy
  - Atomic structure
  - Nuclear physics
  - Radioactivity
  - Radium
tldr: The authors investigate the X-ray spectra of radioactive elements, specifically radium, and analyze the energy levels and characteristics of the emitted X-rays. They deduce information about the atomic structure and nuclear properties of these elements, providing insights into the behavior of X-rays and their role in atomic interactions.
