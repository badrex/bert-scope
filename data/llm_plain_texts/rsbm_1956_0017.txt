tldr: Alexander Oliver Rankine was a British physicist known for his work on the viscosity of gases, the Photophone, and contributions to geophysics. He made significant advancements in measuring the viscosity of gases using a simple and ingenious method, which allowed him to determine the shapes and sizes of molecules and the forces between them. Rankine also worked on ether drift, acoustic and electromagnetic means of submarine detection, and was involved in the development of geophysical prospecting instruments.
