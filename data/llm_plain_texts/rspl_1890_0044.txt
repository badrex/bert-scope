tldr: The author investigates the germination process of castor oil plant seeds and the availability of their reserve materials for the embryo's nutrition. They found that the oil in the seeds is not directly converted into starch, as previously hypothesized, and that fermentation plays a significant role in making the reserve materials available for the embryo's growth. The study also highlights the importance of the endosperm and embryo in the germination process.
