tldr: The study examines the potential of American coals to remove sulphur dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants. It finds that the recently imposed emission standards in the United States are unrealistic due to the reserve base of U.S. coals by total and pyritic sulphur contents. The paper recommends that the standards should be in line with the reserve base and the potential of physical methods for sulphur removal. This is important for the efficient use of coal as a source of electricity and to minimize the environmental impact of coal combustion.
