tldr: This study analyzes global atmospheric temperature fields observed by the selective chopper radiometer on the Nimbus 4 satellite during the year 1970-1971. The research examines data for the period June 1970 to May 1971 and demonstrates the presence of both static and traveling waves in the stratospheric temperatures. The study provides insights into the variation of amplitudes and phases of these waves with latitude, height, and season, contributing to a better understanding of planetary-scale features of the Earth's temperature field.
