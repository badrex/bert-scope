tldr: In 1902, Dr. Tempest Anderson and Dr. John S. Flett investigated the volcanic eruptions in St. Vincent and Martinique. They observed the SoufriÃ¨re volcano's eruption, which caused significant damage and loss of life. The researchers documented the landscape, geological formations, and the impact of the eruption on the islands. Their findings provided valuable information for understanding volcanic activity and its effects on the environment and communities.
