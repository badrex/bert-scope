tldr: This study investigates the age of uraniferous minerals in the Witwatersrand Triad, including the Dominion Reef, Witwatersrand, and Ventersdorp Supergroups in South Africa. The authors analyze rock samples and conclude that the minerals are 3050 ± 50 million years old. They also find evidence of a reworking event at 2040 ± 100 million years ago, which affected some of the samples. The study provides insights into the geological history and mineral formation in the region.
