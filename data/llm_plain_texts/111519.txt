revised_title: Sodium-Ethyl and Potassium-Ethyl Formation and Decomposition
semantic_tags:
  - Organometallic compounds
  - Sodium-ethyl
  - Potassium-ethyl
  - Zinc-ethyl
  - Iodide of ethyl
tldr: Edward Frankland investigated the formation and decomposition of sodium-ethyl and potassium-ethyl. He found that these compounds could not be obtained by the action of sodium on iodide of ethyl. The decomposition of iodide of ethyl by sodium-ethyl produces hydride of ethyl and olefiant gas. This discovery has implications for the formation of hydrogen compounds of highly positive metals.
