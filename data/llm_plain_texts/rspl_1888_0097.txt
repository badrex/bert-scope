tldr: This study investigates the effect of floor-deafening on the sanitary condition of dwelling houses. It finds that deafening material in poorer class houses contains high levels of nitrogenous organic matter and chlorides, which can lead to air pollution and ill-health. In contrast, better class houses with good quality deafening material and proper maintenance have less risk of air pollution.
