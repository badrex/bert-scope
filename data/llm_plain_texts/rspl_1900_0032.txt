The disease has two forms, Dikkopziekte and Dunpaarde-ziekte, and is primarily characterized by swelling, rapid breathing, and foam production from the mouth and nose at the time of death. The author explores methods of protective inoculation, including the use of blood plasma, and the susceptibility of different animals to the disease.
