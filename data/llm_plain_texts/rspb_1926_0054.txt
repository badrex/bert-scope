tldr: The authors discovered a new base, protoctine, in the hydrolysis products of proteins from castor beans and oat proteins. They describe its isolation process and properties, such as solubility in water and alcohol, and its reaction with permanganate in acid solution. Protoctine has an empirical formula of C8H15O3N3 and a molecular weight of 201.
