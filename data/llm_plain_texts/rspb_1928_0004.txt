tldr: The authors analyze various methods used to analyze growth curves and criticize the assumptions made in these methods. They argue that these methods attribute the difference in growth rates solely to environmental factors, while ignoring the internal factors of the organism. They also highlight the limitations of these methods, such as the assumption that the rate of growth is proportional to the size of the organism and that the effect of the environment on the growth rate is the same at all stages of the organism's life.
