tldr: This study examines fluid inclusions in quartz pebbles from the Witwatersrand Basin to understand the genesis of gold-uranium ores. The research distinguishes between pre- and post-depositional inclusions, revealing a moderate to high pressure-temperature environment for vein quartz formation. The findings suggest separate sources for gold and uranium, with uranium influx from discrete areas of the hinterland contemporaneous with sedimentation. The authors propose the use of fluid inclusion research for evaluating and exploring similar deposits.
