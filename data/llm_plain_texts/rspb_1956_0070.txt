tldr: The authors investigated the adaptation of ascites tumours to different hosts, focusing on the concept of actively acquired immunological tolerance. They adapted two mouse lymphomas and a rat hepatoma to ICR mice by injecting foetuses with tumour cells in utero. The study aimed to understand the relationship between the adapted tumours and their original strains, as well as the tumour-host interactions and immune responses.
