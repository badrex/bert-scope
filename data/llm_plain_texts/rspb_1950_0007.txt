tldr: This study examines the nature of adaptive changes in bacteria when exposed to new carbon or nitrogen sources. The authors investigate the proportion of cells that can grow in a new medium and the fate of those that do not. They discuss the two main hypotheses for these adaptive changes: mutation and the modification of internal structures within the cells.
