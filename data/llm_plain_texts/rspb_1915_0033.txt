tldr: The authors developed a bacterial test using Azotobacter and nitrifying organisms to detect plant food accessories, or auximones, which are essential for plant growth. They found that a scum-forming bacteria could be used as a specific test for auximones, and the growth of the scum was proportional to the amount of auximones present. This test could help researchers study the properties and constitution of these important plant growth substances.
