tldr: This article reviews and critically reappraises the field evidence and interpretations of the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous back-arc basin in the southern Andes. It discusses the dimensions of the basin, the proportion of new mafic and relict sialic rocks, and the possible causes of back-arc spreading within a global framework. The study also addresses the tectonic history of the region before and after the development of the back-arc basin.
