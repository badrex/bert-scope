tldr: The authors describe the structure and function of abdominal stretch receptors in various insects. These receptors consist of sensory neurons associated with connective tissue strands or muscles and are found in the dorsal region of the abdomen. The receptors are proprioceptive, as demonstrated by oscillographic recording from the axons of the sensory neurons. Insect abdominal stretch receptors play a crucial role in proprioception and help insects sense and control their body movements.
