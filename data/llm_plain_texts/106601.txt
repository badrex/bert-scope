tldr: The author conducted experiments to investigate the variation of local heat by placing thermometers at different heights and locations. They found that the cold of the night at the lowest station often exceeded the cold at higher stations, and this variation was influenced by the state of the atmosphere, particularly the clearness or cloudiness of the sky. The author also observed that when the sky was clear, the cold seemed to arise from the earth and was found in the greatest degree in the lowest situation.
