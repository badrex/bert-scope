tldr: This study examines the maturation of the ovum in guinea-pigs, focusing on the development of the egg within the ovary. The researchers observed the formation of the first and second polar bodies, as well as the behavior of chromosomes and the role of centrosomes in the process. They also noted a parthenogenetic segmentation process in some eggs, which may lead to the formation of irregular blastomeres.
