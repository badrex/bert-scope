tldr: This article discusses the necessity of spatial symmetries in equilibrium stellar models, focusing on spherical, axisymmetric, and reflection symmetries. The author reviews the understanding of these symmetries in both Newtonian and general relativistic theories, summarizing the arguments that establish their necessity. The article concludes by outlining the limitations of current results and suggesting directions for further progress in the study of equilibrium stellar models.
