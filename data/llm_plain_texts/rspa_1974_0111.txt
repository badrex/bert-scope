tldr: This study investigates the low-temperature magnetothermopower of silver and its dependence on temperature and magnetic field. The research involves seven high-purity silver samples with various crystallographic orientations, and the results provide valuable insights into the behavior of thermopower in noble metals. The findings reveal the importance of both diffusion and phonon drag components in the thermopower and highlight the role of neck regions in determining the sign and magnitude of the phonon drag component.
