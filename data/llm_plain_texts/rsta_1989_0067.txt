tldr: This study investigates the interaction between intraseasonal and interannual waves in the tropics using a simplified ocean-atmosphere model. The model simulates the development of eastward-propagating coupled waves with a period of about six years and shows that intraseasonal waves have little effect on the interannual mode. The results provide insights into the complex relationship between intraseasonal and interannual variability in the tropics and their potential role in triggering El Niño Southern Oscillation events.
