tldr: This article discusses the Feynman principle, a method for formulating quantum field theory. It explains how the principle defines operators and shows that they satisfy the equations of motion. The canonical commutation relations are deduced, and the equivalence of this formulation and the canonical formalism is established. The equations for Feynman amplitudes are also obtained, which include propagators as special cases.
