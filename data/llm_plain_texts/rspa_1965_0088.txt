revised_title: 'Damage and Failure Mechanisms of Heavy-Section Steel: Strain Concentration Effects in Large Structures'
semantic_tags:
  - Fracture mechanics

tldr: This article discusses the damage and failure mechanisms of heavy-section steel structures, focusing on strain concentration effects and fracture initiation. The authors analyze the role of notches, inclusions, and defects in the behavior of steel structures and propose a theoretical approach to determine the fracture stress of large plates containing notches.
