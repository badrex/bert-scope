tldr: In 1761, Rev. Nevil Maskelyne observed the transit of Venus from St. Helena. He measured the distance between Venus and the Sun's limb using a micrometer on a reflecting telescope. Although he could not observe the final internal contact due to cloudy weather, Maskelyne suggested that future observers should place themselves at higher elevations to increase their chances of clear observations. The transit observations aimed to determine the Sun's parallax and the distances of planets from the Sun and each other.
