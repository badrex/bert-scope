tldr: This article describes a radioimmunoassay technique capable of detecting small amounts of proteins in fossils, such as collagen and albumin. The authors successfully identified species-specific proteins in a frozen mammoth, a Pleistocene bison, and various human fossils, including Neanderthal, Homo erectus, and Australopithecus robustus. This method promises to provide molecular data on the genetic affinities of fossil and living species, potentially clarifying evolutionary relationships and disputes.
