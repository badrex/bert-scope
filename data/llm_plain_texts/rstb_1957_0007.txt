tldr: The author analyzes the non-marine mollusca found in the Eemian (Last) Interglacial deposits at Bobbitshole, Ipswich. The mollusca fauna is a local one, consisting of marsh and freshwater species with few species washed in from other environments. The author categorizes the mollusca into groups based on their tolerance to climate and analyzes their percentage frequency throughout the deposit. The results provide insights into the local and climatic conditions during the interglacial period.
