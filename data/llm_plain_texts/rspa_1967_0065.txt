tldr: The authors investigate the ferromagnetic domain structure in haematite crystals using a magnetic colloid method. They observe the domain structure in both natural and synthetic haematite crystals and study the transformation of the structure at low temperatures. The study provides a detailed account of the stages leading to the disappearance of the domain structure in synthetic crystals and reveals the persistence of the structure in natural crystals from Elba.
