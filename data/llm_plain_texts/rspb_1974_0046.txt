revised_title: 'Insulin's Chemistry and Biochemistry: Structure and Function'
semantic_tags:
  - Insulin
  - Protein structure
  - X-ray crystallography
  - Amino acid sequence
  - Diabetes
tldr: The author discusses the history and current understanding of insulin, its chemistry, and biochemistry. They highlight the importance of X-ray crystallography and amino acid sequencing in determining insulin's structure and function. The author also mentions the discovery of proinsulin and its role in insulin production. Despite significant progress, the complete understanding of insulin's action in living creatures still eludes scientists.
