tldr: This article presents a theoretical method for calculating flame properties based on the characteristics of flame gases. The authors discuss the advantages and disadvantages of their method, which avoids the kinetic steady-state approximation, and apply it to a one-dimensional time-independent flame with idealized kinetics and transport properties. The study analyzes the effects of various parameters on flame behavior and provides insights into the significance of different processes in maintaining energy conservation.
