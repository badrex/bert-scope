revised_title: Antiferromagnetism in Face-Centered Cubic Lattice: Spin-Wave Method
semantic_tags:
  - Antiferromagnetism
  - Spin-wave theory
  - Face-centered cubic lattice
  - Exchange interactions
  - Magnetic properties
tldr: The authors apply the spin-wave method to study antiferromagnetism in a face-centered cubic lattice with dominantly nearest-neighbor exchange interactions. They discuss the stability of type 1 and type 3 order, particularly for salts like potassium and ammonium iridium. The study estimates the Curie temperature and considers the influence of anisotropy, showing good agreement between theory and experiment.
