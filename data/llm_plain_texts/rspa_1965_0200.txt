revised_title: 'Molecular Constants and Vibration-Rotation Bands of Methyl Iodide'
semantic_tags:
  - Molecular spectroscopy
  - Vibration-rotation bands
  - Methyl iodide
  - Isotopic molecules
  - Molecular constants
tldr: The authors measured the rotational fine structure of methyl iodide's vibration-rotation bands and determined the molecular rotational constants. They also compared the values of certain constants in the pair of isotopic molecules with what would be expected, providing insights into the behavior of these molecules.
