tldr: The authors studied two strains of magnetotactic bacteria using electron microscopy to analyze the magnetite crystals they produce. They found that the crystals in each strain have different shapes and sizes, suggesting that the biomineralization process is strain-specific. This research contributes to the understanding of how bacteria create and control the formation of magnetic crystals within their cells.
