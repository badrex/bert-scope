tldr: E.J. Lowe presents a new, smaller, and more efficient ozone-box design for monitoring atmospheric ozone levels. The box features a dark, circular chamber with a constant air current, allowing for better ozone detection. Lowe also introduces calico test-slips as a more durable alternative to paper, which helps improve the accuracy of ozone measurements. The results show that the new ozone-box and test-slips provide a more reliable method for detecting and measuring atmospheric ozone.
