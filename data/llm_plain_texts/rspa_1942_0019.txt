tldr: This article presents an elementary theory of thermal diffusion, explaining the physical mechanism behind the phenomenon and its applications in separating gas mixtures. The theory uses a method similar to Meyer's treatment of ordinary diffusion and provides an approximate formula for the thermal diffusion ratio. Although the theory has limitations, it offers a simpler understanding of the underlying principles compared to the rigorous kinetic theory of non-uniform gases.
