tldr: This article discusses the concept of parity non-conservation in weak interactions, focusing on the theoretical and experimental aspects. The author highlights the historical origin of the idea, the role of neutrinos, and the implications of parity non-conservation in various particle decays. The article also explores the two-component theory of the neutrino and the conservation of leptons.
