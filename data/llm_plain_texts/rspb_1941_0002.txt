revised_title: 'Photosynthesis Mechanisms in Intermittent Illumination'
semantic_tags:
  - Photosynthesis
  - Intermittent illumination
  - Carbon dioxide reduction
  - Chlorophyll
  - Plant Physiology
tldr: The author's experiments show that photosynthesis can occur during both light and dark periods in intermittent illumination. They suggest a mechanism where chlorophyll activates a substance that reduces carbon dioxide, and the rate of photosynthesis depends on the intensity and duration of light flashes and dark periods.
