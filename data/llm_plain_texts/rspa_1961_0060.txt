tldr: The authors studied the magnetic properties and crystal field effects in hydrated cobalt salts. They derived theoretical expressions for magnetic susceptibility and anisotropy based on Abragam and Pryce's theory and compared them with experimental results for three Tutton salts. The findings suggest that the anisotropic crystal field parameter is influenced more by the alkali cation than the acid radicals in the salts. The spin-orbit coupling coefficient remains nearly the same as the free ion value, indicating minimal overlap between the s- and d-orbitals.
