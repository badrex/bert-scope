tldr: This study presents a quantitative method for analyzing pleochroic haloes in biotite minerals using a halo photometer. The authors examine biotite samples from various locations and find that the ring radii in the haloes are consistent across different ages of the minerals, supporting the idea that the ranges of alpha particles have remained the same throughout geological time.
