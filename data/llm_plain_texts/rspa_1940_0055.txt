tldr: This study investigates the behavior of polar molecules in solid paraffin wax, focusing on the relaxation time of long-chain esters embedded in the medium. The authors examine the ester amyl stearate and compare its properties to those of even-numbered esters. They find that the behavior of odd and even esters is quite similar, and no significant alternation effect is observed.
