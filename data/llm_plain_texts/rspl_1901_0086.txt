tldr: This research focuses on the development of the stem in Pteridophyta and Gymnosperms, specifically the cauline fibro-vascular skeleton. The study concludes that the polystelic type does not originate through repeated bifurcation of the epicotyledonary central cylinder, but rather becomes a concentric fibro-vascular tube. The central cylinder's tubular nature may be disguised by the overlapping of gaps and the appearance of medullary strands. The author believes there are two primitive stocks of vascular plants: Lycopsida and Pteropsida.
