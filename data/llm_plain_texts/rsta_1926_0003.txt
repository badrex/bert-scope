tldr: This article investigates the flow of viscous fluids around circular cylinders and presents a functional approach to solving problems related to this motion. The authors focus on steady, two-dimensional flow and explore the effects of rotation and translation of cylinders in the presence of fixed walls. They also discuss the limitations of the "slow-motion" treatment and the potential of more advanced methods, such as the stream function and the principle of successive reflections.
