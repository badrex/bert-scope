revised_title: 'Nuclear Gene Products in Mitochondrial DNA Replication'
semantic_tags:
  - Mitochondrial DNA replication
  - DNA primase
  - Endoribonuclease
  - Mitochondrial DNA priming
  - DNA replication initiation
tldr: The article discusses the process of mitochondrial DNA replication in eukaryotic cells, focusing on the role of nuclear gene products in the replication initiation. It explains the function of the D-loop origin and the light-strand origin, as well as the involvement of endoribonuclease and DNA primase in the replication process.
