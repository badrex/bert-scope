revised_title: 'On the Nuclei and Crystallization of Supersaturated Saline Solutions'
semantic_tags:
  - Crystal growth
  - Supersaturated solutions
  - Nucleation
  - Saline solutions
  - Chemical reactions
tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the behavior of supersaturated saline solutions and discovered that clean crystals of normal salt can initiate crystallization in these solutions. The author also found that different salts have varying abilities to initiate crystallization in supersaturated solutions, and discussed the possible presence of nuclei in the atmosphere.
