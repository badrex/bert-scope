tldr: The authors present a method for calculating energy levels in rare-earth ions using quantum mechanics and matrix calculations. They apply this method to the terms of and compare it to previous work by Judd. The possible states are found to be ( ) ( ) ( ) where the seniority number is written as a suffix. The matrix is provided in the article.
