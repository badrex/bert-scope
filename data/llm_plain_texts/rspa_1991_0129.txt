tldr: This article presents a dislocation-based approximate solution for the stress-strain field of the plastic zone of a mode II crack in an elastic perfectly plastic and incompressible solid. The solution uses general dislocation equations applicable for plane strain elastic-plastic conditions and considers dislocation crack tip shielding and the dislocation crack extension force. The findings have broader applications beyond the specific problem addressed in the paper.
