tldr: This article discusses the results of experiments conducted by the Ariel III satellite to study the anomalous features of electron density in the topside ionosphere. The authors describe the instruments used to measure electron density and temperature, and explain the techniques employed to overcome challenges such as varying spacecraft potential and poor signal-to-noise ratios. The experiments provide valuable data on electron density and temperature, which can help improve our understanding of the ionosphere and its interactions with the Earth's atmosphere.
