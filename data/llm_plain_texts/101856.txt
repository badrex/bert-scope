tldr: This article compares the populations, housing, and wealth of London and Paris in the late 17th century. Sir William Petty uses data on mortality rates, housing numbers, and trade to argue that London is the more significant city. Petty also discusses the poverty in Paris and suggests ways to improve hospital care for the poor.
