tldr: The author, Joseph Williamson, claims his invention of clocks that keep time with the sun's apparent motion. He explains his method of adjusting pendulum length to account for the sun's changing position throughout the year. He also discusses the limitations of using springs and balances in pocket watches for showing minute differences in time. His clocks were sold to notable individuals, and he believes he has the greatest right to this invention.
