tldr: The authors investigated the viability of rat ovarian tissue after exposure to low temperatures and found that slow cooling to -79Â°C in a medium containing glycerol allowed for successful regeneration of functional autografts. The study provides insights into the potential for preserving and reviving ovarian tissue for future use in fertility treatments and research.
