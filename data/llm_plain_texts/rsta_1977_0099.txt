tldr: This article discusses the major questions remaining about the origin and evolution of the lunar surface. The authors argue that the surface material likely fell in its present form rather than being the result of meteoritic grinding of a lunar endogenic crust. They also question the concept of a chemically differentiated Moon and suggest that most of the surface represents the last stages of accretion, with chemical differentiation having taken place previously in the source material.
