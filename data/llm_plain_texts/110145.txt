tldr: The author examines the structure of human lung cells to understand their role in respiration. He investigates the circulation of blood through the lungs and the function of air-cells. The author's findings challenge the existing theory of respiration and suggest that the lung's structure is better suited for receiving supplies from the atmosphere and transmitting them to the heart. He also considers the role of carbonic acid in the blood and its connection to digestion.
