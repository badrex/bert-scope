tldr: This study investigates the effects of Mach number on vortex shedding of a square cylinder and a thick symmetrical airfoil arranged in tandem at high Reynolds numbers. The results show that regular vortex shedding is not suppressed by shock waves and that the Strouhal number increases with increasing Mach number. The formation region becomes asymmetric and wavy, leading to enhanced vortex shedding. The mean pressure decreases and pressure fluctuations increase with increasing Mach number, except when steady shock waves form on the separating shear layers.
