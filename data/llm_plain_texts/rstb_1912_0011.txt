tldr: The authors conducted a preliminary investigation of the human electrocardiogram in young male adults to establish a basis for pathological study. They used Einthoven's string galvanometer to examine the electrocardiograms of healthy medical students and analyzed the effects of different deflection times on the accuracy of the curves. The study aimed to understand the normal electrocardiogram and its variations in healthy subjects, which could help in identifying abnormalities in the heart's electrical activity.
