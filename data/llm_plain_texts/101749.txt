tldr: 'Robert Boyle conducted experiments on the superficial figures of fluids, particularly those contiguous to other fluids. He observed the effects of different fluids' contact and how it could contribute to the physical theory of the grand system of the world. His experiments included testing the surface figures of water, oil, and mercury when in contact with other fluids, providing insights into the formation of celestial bodies.'
