tldr: The authors used electron microscopy to study the structure of myosin molecules from various sources, including muscle and non-muscle tissues. They found that myosin molecules from all sources have a similar structure, with two globular heads joined to a tail. This study helps to understand the similarities and differences in myosin molecules from different sources and contributes to the field of molecular biology.
