tldr: Dr. F. Crace-Calvert conducted experiments to study the effect of various substances on the growth of microscopic life and putrefaction in albumen and gelatine solutions. The substances were classified into six groups based on their impact on the development of animalcules and putrefaction. The study aimed to understand how these substances could potentially be used to control or promote the growth of microscopic life.
