tldr: This article explores the relationship between song production and perception in birds, focusing on the vocal control system of oscine songbirds. The authors present three studies that investigate neurogenesis in a song control nucleus, the relation between learning and forgetting, and how song is perceived. They discuss the importance of understanding the connection between perception and production for understanding the vocal control system in birds.
