tldr: The authors conducted a study on the distribution of nitrogenous substances in tumor and somatic tissues. They found that tumor cells have a lower percentage of coagulable nitrogen compared to the host's cells, indicating a difference in their chemical composition. This suggests that cancer cells grow more rapidly than the host's cells, as they require less protein to build up a larger mass. These findings are important for understanding the chemistry and metabolism of cancer cells and their growth.
