tldr: The author observed the circulation and globules of blood in small fish, using a microscope to study their blood vessels and the shape of blood particles. They discovered that the particles were not always oval, but could be round or shapeless due to the stretching of blood vessels. The author also found that the blood of a salmon contains more red particles, giving it a darker color. This research helped to further understand the structure and shape of blood cells in both fish and humans.
