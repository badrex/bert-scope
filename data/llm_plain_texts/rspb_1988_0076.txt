tldr: The authors discovered a horizontal cell (HC-B) in the roach retina that selectively contacts blue-sensitive cones. They used horseradish peroxidase to intracellularly stain the HC-B cell and studied its light-evoked responses. The HC-B cell generated biphasic S-potentials, with a large hyperpolarization in the blue region of the spectrum and a modest depolarization in the yellow-orange region. This study provides insights into the connectivity and function of horizontal cells in the retina, particularly in coding chromatic aspects of visual information.
