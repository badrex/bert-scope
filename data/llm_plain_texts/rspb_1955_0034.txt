tldr: This study investigates the impact of population density on the reproduction and survival of two experimental vole populations. The results show that larger populations experience less growth, shorter breeding seasons, and lower fertility compared to smaller populations. The study suggests that intraspecific strife, such as chasing and fighting, is more frequent in larger populations, limiting their growth and affecting their overall reproductive success.
