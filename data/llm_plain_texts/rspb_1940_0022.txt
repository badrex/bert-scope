tldr: This study examines the sexual cycle and gonad development in male salmon (Salmo salar). The researchers found that the majority of male salmon parr exhibit a sexual cycle where the gonad develops in summer, reaches maturity in autumn, and becomes spent in winter. After spawning, a high percentage of males migrate to the sea. The study also provides insights into the histological changes in the male gonad phases during the sexual cycle.
