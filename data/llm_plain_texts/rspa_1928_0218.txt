revised_title: 'Extension of Wave Mechanics Principles to Gravitational Fields'
semantic_tags:
  - Wave Mechanics
  - Principle of Least Action
  - Gravitational Fields
  - Electromagnetic Fields
  - Tensor Equations
tldr: The author extends the principles of wave mechanics, including the principle of least action, to include gravitational fields. They derive wave equations in a gravitational field and show that the energy density and current are conjugate quantities. The author also demonstrates how to incorporate electromagnetic and gravitational fields into a unified system using tensor equations.
