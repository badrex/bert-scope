tldr: The author, Thomas Graham, conducted experiments on the motion of gases and their transpiration through capillary tubes. He discovered that the transpiration velocity of gases is influenced by their density and that the law of effusion applies to both effusion and diffusion of gases. Graham also found that the transpiration velocity of gases becomes constant after a certain length of the capillary tube, and he introduced the concept of transpirability as a new property of gases. The author observed that the transpiration of gases is affected by the resistance and length of the capillary tube, and he provided a detailed analysis of the transpiration times of various gases, including hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide.
