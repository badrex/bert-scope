tldr: This article investigates reflex electrical effects in mixed nerve and anterior and posterior roots using frog experiments. The researchers found that negative variations were reflex in character, and the electrical effects could not be obtained in rapid succession. The study offers evidence of the passage of centrifugal nerve impulses in normally afferent nerve channels.
