tldr: This study investigates the effect of high altitudes on human adaptability, specifically the dietary-induced thermogenesis. The researchers found that at high altitudes, the metabolic response to food is diminished, which aids in energy conservation and efficient utilization of food energy. However, this lack of thermic response can also lead to a disadvantage in maintaining body temperature in cold environments.
