tldr: The authors conducted a series of measurements to determine the absolute value of the mechanical equivalent of heat in terms of international electrical units. They used a continuous method of calorimetry to measure the heat capacity of water at different temperatures and compared their results with previous studies. The findings showed a close agreement with other measurements, indicating that the values for electrical units were close to the true values. The study also discussed the importance of the 15Â°C calorie value and its relation to other measurements.
