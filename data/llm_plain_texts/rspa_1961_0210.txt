revised_title: 'Experimental Determination of Fusion Cross-Sections with Low-Energy Deuterons'
semantic_tags:
  - Nuclear fusion
  - Deuterons
  - Cross-section measurements
  - Gas targets
  - Scintillation detectors
tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the fusion cross-sections of deuterons with low energies. They used a gas target and scintillation detectors to observe the fast protons from the reaction. The results provide a better understanding of nuclear reactions and their contribution to thermonuclear reactions and astrophysics.
