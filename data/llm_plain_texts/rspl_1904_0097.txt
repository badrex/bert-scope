tldr: The author investigates the production of a specific gastrotoxic serum and its effects on the stomach. They successfully produce a hetero-gastrolytic serum by injecting the mucous membrane of the guinea pig's stomach into a rabbit. The author also explores the effects of the serum on the stomach cells of the guinea pig in vitro and in vivo, discovering that the serum causes necrosis and ulcers in the stomach. This research contributes to understanding the pathology of human gastric ulcers.
