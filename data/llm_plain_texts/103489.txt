tldr: In March 1726, George Whiston observed four mock-suns, a rare meteorological phenomenon, in a garden at Kensington. He described the halo around the sun, the parhelia, and their colors. The upper part of the halo had a confused mixture of rainbow colors, and the parhelia had brightness and color similar to the upper part of the halo. This observation is significant as it provides insight into atmospheric optics and optical phenomena.
