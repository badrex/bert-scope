tldr: This article discusses the development and applications of two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, which allows for better separation and analysis of complex molecular structures. The technique involves using the two-dimensional Fourier transformation to separate different NMR parameters, such as chemical shifts and spin coupling constants, into two frequency dimensions. This improves the accessibility of information in NMR spectra and enables new experiments and applications, including the detection of forbidden transitions and the correlation of proton and carbon chemical shifts.
