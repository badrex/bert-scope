tldr: Researchers analyzed ancient bone DNA from prehistoric Pacific islanders and found a previously characterized Asian-specific mitochondrial DNA mutation in samples from Polynesia, but not in samples from Melanesian archipelagos. This discovery challenges the current view that the central Pacific was settled directly by voyagers from island Southeast Asia, the putative ancestors of modern Polynesians. Instead, an earlier occupation by peoples from neighboring Melanesian archipelagos seems more likely.
