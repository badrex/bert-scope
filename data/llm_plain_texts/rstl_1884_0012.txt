tldr: This article describes the photographic results obtained during the total solar eclipse of May 17, 1882. The authors, Captain W. de W. Abney and Arthur Schuster, detail their observations and experiments using photographic instruments, including spectroscopes and cameras, to capture images of the solar corona and prominences. They discuss the challenges faced during the expedition, the sensitiveness of the gelatine plates used, and the importance of accurate orientation and timing in capturing valuable data.
