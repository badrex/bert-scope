tldr: This study investigates the ionization of human methaemoglobins A, S, and C and their reactivity differences. The researchers found that the different ionization thermodynamics of these haemoglobins are due to different electrostatic interactions resulting from their amino acid compositions. This work helps understand the reaction of haemoglobins with oxygen and carbon monoxide.
