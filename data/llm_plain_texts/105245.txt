tldr: The author, William Lewis, conducted experiments to distinguish and purify gold mixed with platina. They discovered that mercury has a greater affinity with gold than platina, and that platina can be separated from gold through a process of elutriation. The author also found that fixed alkaline salts can partially precipitate platina, while volatile alkalies can precipitate gold entirely but only partially precipitate platina. This research provides a method for distinguishing and recovering gold from any admixture of platina.
