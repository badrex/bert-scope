tldr: The author, C. Mortimer, describes his experience during the earthquake of March 8, 1749. He felt six distinct shocks and observed the effects of the earthquake on his house, such as cracks in the walls and a slightly displaced post. Mortimer also notes that the door between two rooms, which had been unlatched and flapped during the first shock, remained latched during the subsequent shocks, suggesting that the house was lifted during the first earthquake but only rocked during the later ones.
