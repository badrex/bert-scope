tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the emission of radiation during the explosion and cooling of inflammable mixtures of hydrogen and air. They discovered that the proportion of heat lost by radiation varies greatly with the mixture strength in hydrogen mixtures, unlike coal-gas mixtures. The authors also found that the maximum rate of radiation emission in hydrogen mixtures occurs at the moment of maximum temperature, while in coal-gas mixtures, it occurs during the explosion period. These findings provide insights into the behavior of gaseous combustion and heat transfer in different mixtures.
