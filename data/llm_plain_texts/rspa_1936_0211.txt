tldr: This study investigates the combustion kinetics of methane, focusing on the slow reaction process. The authors discovered that the reaction follows a chain mechanism involving oxygen atoms and methylene radicals, with formaldehyde as a primary product. They also found that the ignition of methane is a thermal phenomenon, and the reaction velocity increases as the temperature approaches the ignition limit.
