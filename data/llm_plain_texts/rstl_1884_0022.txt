tldr: The author investigates the conditions of chemical change in gases, focusing on hydrogen, carbonic oxide, and oxygen. They examine the influence of physical forces, reaction conditions, and mass on the transformation of one kind of matter into another. The author's experiments reveal discrepancies between previous observations and provide insights into the division of oxygen in gaseous mixtures.
