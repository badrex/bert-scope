tldr: The author measured the visual brightness of the corona during the total eclipses of August 29, 1886, and April 16, 1893, using a method devised by Sir W. Abney. They found that the intensity of the corona's light falls off rapidly at first and that the results from photographic observations differ from visual observations. The study provides valuable information about the brightness and behavior of the solar corona, which is important for understanding solar physics and eclipses.
