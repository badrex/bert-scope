semantic_tags:
  - High pressure biology
  - Underwater physiology
  - Decompression sickness
  - Inert gas narcosis
  - High pressure neurological syndrome
tldr: This article explores the effects of high pressure on divers and life, discussing the biological responses to high pressure and the underlying physical principles. It examines the high pressure neurological syndrome, inert gas narcosis, and decompression sickness, and how these factors limit the depths divers can reach and the rate at which they can return to the surface. The article also analyzes the value of physicochemical reasoning in understanding these phenomena.
