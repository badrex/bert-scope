tldr: The authors discovered a new structure of graphite that explains extra lines observed in X-ray powder graphs of graphite. This new structure has hexagonal layers similar to graphite but arranged in a different sequence. It is present in about 14% of the samples examined. This finding has implications for understanding the properties of graphite and its applications in material science.
