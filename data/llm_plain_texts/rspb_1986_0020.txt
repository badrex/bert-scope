tldr: The authors study the process of soft rot cavity widening in wood decay by fungi, focusing on the micromorphology of diamond-shaped and cylindrical cavities. They construct a mathematical model to describe cavity widening and compare it with observed kinetics. The study reveals that the rate of cavity widening is determined by the chemical composition of the S2 layer of the secondary wood cell wall, and cavity elaboration occurs at the cylindrical surface.
