tldr: The author, T. H. Laby, discusses the advancements in measuring the thermal conductivity of air using various methods, including parallel plate and hot wire methods. The experiments conducted by different researchers, such as Hercus, Sutherland, Kannuluik, and Martin, have improved the accuracy and convenience of measuring thermal conductivities of gases. The results confirm the value found by Weber and show that different methods agree with each other.
