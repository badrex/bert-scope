tldr: The author describes a virus causing foliar necrosis in potato plants, which affects the foliage without producing internal changes in the stem. The virus, named "D," is transmitted through various plants and has different effects on different potato varieties. The disease progresses in two stages, with the first stage causing necrotic spots on leaves and the second stage showing interveinal mosaic and necroses. The virus does not affect the apical and axillary growing points, and the tubers appear healthy but may show interveinal mottle and necroses as the plant matures.
