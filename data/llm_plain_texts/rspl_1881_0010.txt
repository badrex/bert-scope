tldr: The author, H. Helmholtz, developed an electrodynamic balance to measure the intensity of galvanic currents without being affected by terrestrial magnetism. The balance uses two coils of copper wire suspended from a lever, and the author describes the challenges and solutions in constructing the device. The balance can determine the weight that balances the electrodynamic force with minimal errors, providing a more accurate measurement of the current's intensity.
