tldr: The authors conducted a study on the lymphatic glands of sleeping sickness patients and found that trypanosomes were present in large numbers in the glands. They believe that the disease is essentially a polyadenitis caused by the arrest of trypanosomes in the glands, where many are destroyed, but some escape into the bloodstream, causing an increase in peripheral circulation. Their findings support the unity of trypanosomiasis and sleeping sickness and prove that trypanosomes are the essential cause of sleeping sickness.
