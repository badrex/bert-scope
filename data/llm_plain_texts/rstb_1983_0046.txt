revised_title: 'Phosphorylation of RNA Polymerases: The Specific Association of Protein Kinase Nil with RNA Polymerase I'
semantic_tags:
  - Protein phosphorylation
  - RNA polymerase
  - Protein kinase Nil
  - Ribosomal RNA synthesis
  - Transcription regulation
tldr: The authors investigated the activity of RNA polymerases in rat liver and Morris hepatoma 3924A cells, finding that RNA polymerase I had a higher activity in the rapidly growing tumor cells. They discovered that protein kinase Nil, which is associated with RNA polymerase I, plays a role in activating and phosphorylating the enzyme. This regulation may control the rate of ribosomal RNA synthesis in the cell.
