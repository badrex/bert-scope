tldr: This article discusses the morphology, mechanics, and Quaternary history of two Lias clay slopes in the upper Gwash valley, Rutland, in southern England. The authors analyze the development of these slopes and the landslides that occurred, providing insights into the stress-dependent residual strength of Upper Lias clay and its implications for slope stability.
