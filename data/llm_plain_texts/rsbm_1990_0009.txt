tldr: Luis Federico Leloir was a renowned biochemist who discovered a new class of biological compounds, hybrids of nucleotides and sugars, which play a crucial role in the synthesis of oligo- and polysaccharides in living organisms. His work led to the recognition that catabolic and anabolic processes do not proceed via the same reversible pathways but along separate routes. Leloir's significant contributions include the discovery of glucose-1,6-diphosphate (G1,6DP) and uridine diphosphate glucose (UDPG) as coenzymes, and the understanding that the synthesis of polysaccharides, like glycogen and starch, differs from their breakdown routes and involves different catalysts.
