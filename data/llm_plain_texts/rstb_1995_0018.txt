revised_title: Neuronal Pathways of Classical Crustacean Neurohormones in the Woodlouse Oniscus asellus
semantic_tags:
  - Neuroendocrine regulation
  - Isopod neurohormones
  - Central nervous system
  - Neuropeptide-immunoreactive neurons
  - Neurosecretory pathways
tldr: This study maps neuropeptide-immunoreactive neurons in the central nervous system of the woodlouse Oniscus asellus, identifying new neurosecretory pathways and various types of neurons. The research provides insights into the cellular sources of crustacean neurohormones and their potential functions as neurotransmitters or neuromodulators.
