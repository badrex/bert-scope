tldr: This article discusses the need for more rational and biorational approaches in the development of new pesticides due to the high cost of research and development, increasing regulatory requirements, and the decreasing success rate of commercial pesticides. The authors explore various research approaches, including synthetic modifications of natural product models, development of metabolic disrupters or enhancers, and innovative bioassays. They focus on the extensive investigation of juvenile hormone agonists and antagonists as examples of biorational aspects in discovering highly selective insecticidal agents.
