tldr: The article discusses the control analysis of photosynthetic sucrose synthesis, focusing on the distribution of elasticity coefficients and flux-control coefficients in the cytosolic fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase and sucrose phosphate synthase. The author explains how control is shared between these enzymes and how changes in their properties can affect the overall process of photosynthesis.
