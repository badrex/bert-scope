tldr: This article discusses the biochemistry of Chlamydomonas flagella, focusing on their structure and protein composition. The authors describe various methods to extract and analyze the proteins within the flagella, including using buffers with different ionic strengths and solvents like urea and guanidine chloride. They also mention the potential to correlate genetic loci for flagellar synthesis with the polypeptide chains separated by electrophoresis. This research provides a means to study the synthesis of individual flagellar proteins and the factors controlling their synthesis.
