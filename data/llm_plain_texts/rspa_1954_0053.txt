tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure detachment cross-sections for negative ions colliding with rare gas atoms. They produced negative ions using thermal dissociation and electron bombardment methods, and found that the detachment cross-sections for ions produced in both ways were the same. This study provided insights into the existence of long-lifetime excited states of negative ions and helped understand the ionization process.
