tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the cause of the weight loss when metallic copper is exposed to the action of copper sulphate and sulphuric acid. The results showed that the weight loss is mainly due to the presence of oxygen in the solution. The author also discussed the possibility of copper sulphide formation and the optical arrangement of composite eyes in insects.
