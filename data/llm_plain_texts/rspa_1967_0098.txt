tldr: The iodination of ethyl pyruvate in aqueous solution is found to be a zero-order reaction with respect to iodine and is catalyzed by bases. The rate of ionization in the absence of other catalysts is similar to that of pyruvic acid. The reaction does not go to completion, and its equilibrium constant was measured. The acid strength of ethyl pyruvate was determined from the equilibrium constant and the rate of ionization.
