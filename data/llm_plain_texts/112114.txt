tldr: The author, N. Story Maskelyne, discovered two new minerals, Langite and Waringtonite, in Cornwall. Langite is a blue-green mineral with a crystal structure similar to cerussite, while Waringtonite is a green mineral with a unique double-curved wedge shape. Both minerals have distinct physical and chemical properties, and their discovery expands the knowledge of the Brochantite group of minerals.
