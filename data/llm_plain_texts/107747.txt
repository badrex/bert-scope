tldr: This article discusses the research conducted by Humphry Davy on the preservation of metals, particularly copper, through electrochemical means. He discovered that adding small amounts of other metals like iron, tin, zinc, or arsenic to copper can form insoluble compounds on the surface, preventing corrosion and adhesion of weeds and shellfish. Davy also found that copper sheets protected by a layer of cast iron can increase in weight due to the deposition of alkaline and earthy substances, which helps prevent corrosion.
