tldr: 'The author, C. T. R. Wilson, describes a method to measure the atmospheric electric potential gradient and the earth-air current. They conducted experiments using a gold leaf electrometer and found that the ratio of the current to the charge remained consistent when the test-plate was covered with turf. This research aimed to determine the charge per square centimeter of the ground and the current entering each square centimeter of the ground.'
