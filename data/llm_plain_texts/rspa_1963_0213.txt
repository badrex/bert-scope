tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the flash photolysis of carbon disulphide to study the production and decay of vibrationally excited CS molecules. They demonstrated the presence of vibrationally excited CS using vacuum ultra-violet spectroscopy and suggested that atomic sulfur causes fast vibrational relaxation, possibly involving multiple quantum transitions. The authors also observed new absorption bands in the CS molecule and discussed the effect of adding oxygen to the gas mixtures on the decay of vibrationally excited CS.
