tldr: The authors describe a method to measure heart efficiency using recoil curves obtained from a hot-wire microphone. They explain the setup and functioning of the apparatus, which records body movements, apex beat, and breathing. The method provides valuable insights into physical efficiency, especially for aviators. The authors also discuss the limitations and potential improvements of the technique.
