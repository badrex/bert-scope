tldr: This article examines the changes in heliographic latitudes of sunspots from 1861 to 1902, analyzing the distribution and movement of sunspots during this period. The authors found that the law of spot zones, as discovered by Carrington and corroborated by Sporer, only represents a general idea of a complex sunspot circulation. The study provides insight into the varying positions and movements of the centers of spot activity, which can help understand solar activity and its effects on Earth.
