tldr: This article explores the concept of atmospheric stirring and its relation to precipitation. The author develops an equation to calculate the eddy-diffusivity, a measure of the effect of circulatory motions in the atmosphere, and uses this to analyze the vertical flux of water in the atmosphere. The study finds that the average rate of precipitation is influenced by the eddy-diffusivity and provides insights into the global distribution of precipitation.
