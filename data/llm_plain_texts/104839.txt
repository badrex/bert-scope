tldr: The author, Richard Brocklesby, conducts experiments with the Indian Poison, as described by M. de la Condamine, and observes its effects on animals. He finds that the poison does not have the same effects on all creatures and that it is not a specific poison. The author concludes that the supposed specific antidote is of no use and that the poison may be similar to white arsenic in treating toothaches.
