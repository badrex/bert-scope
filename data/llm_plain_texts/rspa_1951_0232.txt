tldr: The authors explore the validity of phenomenological approaches to meson production in nucleon-nucleon collisions. They consider the energy interaction densities and the contact transformation to analyze the processes involved. The study focuses on scalar and pseudoscalar fields, and the results show that certain approaches may not account for meson production when recoil is neglected.
