tldr: The authors investigate the absorption of light by halogen elements, such as chlorine, bromine, and iodine, in a vapour state. They observe changes in the absorption spectra and vapour densities of these elements as the temperature increases. The results suggest that the elements undergo molecular dissociation and form more complex, highly absorptive molecules at higher temperatures.
