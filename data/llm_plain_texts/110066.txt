tldr: The author, Humphry Davy, conducted experiments to find ways to protect copper sheathing on ships from corrosion using electrical combinations. He discovered that cast iron was the most convenient protecting metal and that the plumbaginous substance formed on it did not impede the electrical action. He also found that weak solutions of salt acted strongly on copper, while strong ones did not, due to the presence of oxygen. This research suggested ways to preserve brass and steel instruments using iron and zinc.
