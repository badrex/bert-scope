tldr: The authors, George J. Romanes and James C. Ewart, conducted a detailed study on the locomotor system of echinodermata, specifically focusing on Holothuria and Spatangus. They observed the structure and function of the polian vesicle, ambulacral vessels, and pedicels, as well as the role of the circular fibres in the body wall and the muscular bands in the eversion of the perisome and protrusion of tentacles. They also discussed the fluid dynamics and the nervous system of Echinus, providing insights into the movement and sensory capabilities of these marine animals.
