tldr: The authors examine the seed structure of Lagenostoma Lomaxi and find strong evidence that it belongs to the plant Lyginodendron Oldhamium. This discovery supports the idea that Lyginodendron is a transitional plant between ferns and gymnosperms during Palaeozoic times. The seed's unique pollen-chamber and cupule structure, along with its vascular system, provide insights into the reproductive methods of these ancient plants.
