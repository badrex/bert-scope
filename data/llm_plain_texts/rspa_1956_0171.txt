tldr: The authors describe the design and functionality of a Raman spectrometer that uses direct photoelectric recording for intensity measurements. The spectrometer features a high-intensity light source with four Toronto-type mercury arcs, allowing for various sample volumes and temperatures. Semi-quantitative polarization measurements can also be made using an E.M.I. eleven-stage photomultiplier cell with a.c. amplification and a phase-sensitive homodyne circuit. This apparatus offers improved accuracy and versatility for Raman spectroscopy.
