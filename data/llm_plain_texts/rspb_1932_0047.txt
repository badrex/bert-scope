revised_title: 'A Detailed Analysis of Nerve Heat Production'
semantic_tags:
  - Neurophysiology
  - Heat production in nerve
  - Nerve impulse
  - Recovery heat
  - Initial heat
tldr: The author investigates the heat production in nerves during and after nerve impulses. They discover that heat production occurs in two phases: initial and recovery. The initial heat is found to be less significant, while the recovery heat continues for several minutes after the impulse. The author also discusses the limitations of current methods for measuring initial heat and the importance of understanding the nature of the nervous impulse.
