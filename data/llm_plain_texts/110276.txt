tldr: The author, A.P.W. Philip, discusses the sources and nature of the powers that maintain the circulation of blood. He refutes the idea that the circulation is maintained by the elasticity of the heart, resilience of the lungs, or the dilatation of the thoracic cavity. Instead, he shows experimentally that the circulation continues unimpeded when these factors are removed. Philip concludes that the circulation is maintained by the combined power of the heart and blood vessels, and that both possess a muscular power.
