tldr: The author suggests that the Earth's mantle and core composition can be better understood by considering a distinct type of chondritic composition, rather than the standard CI model. This new model, based on nebular processes, provides a better explanation for the refractory lithophile element abundances in the Earth's upper mantle and challenges previous assumptions about the formation of the Earth and its relationship to chondrites.
