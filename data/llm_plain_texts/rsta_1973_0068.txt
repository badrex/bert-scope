tldr: The authors propose a tectonic model for Afghanistan, suggesting that an Iran-Afghan crustal block acts as a buffer between the stable Asian mass, the Indian-Australian crustal plate, and the Arabian Peninsula block. They analyze regional seismicity data and fault systems to create a seismo-tectonic map, which reveals active faults and seismic activity patterns in the country. This model helps explain the dominant tectonic processes and seismic activity in Afghanistan.
