tldr: This article presents two rare cases of abdominal tumors in women. The first case involves a woman with a tumor that grew for ten years, and the second case is of a maid-servant whose belly swelled after a suppression of menstruation. Both cases resulted in the women's deaths, and the autopsies revealed interesting findings about the tumors and the women's bodies. The author also cites three other similar cases.
