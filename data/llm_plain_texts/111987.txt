tldr: The author, A. W. Hofmann, explores the transformation of beta-phenylene-diamine into kinone and its reactions with aniline and benzidine. He discovers that aniline and benzidine react with oxidizing agents to produce kinone, and further examines the behavior of these two compounds with each other. The study of this reaction led to the discovery of hydrokinone and the investigation of chloranilamide.
