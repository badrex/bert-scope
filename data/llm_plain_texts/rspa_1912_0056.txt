tldr: The author investigates a substance called azomethine, which forms gels with various solvents. These gels are unique because they can be reversed by heat, unlike other gels. The author explores the properties of these gels, including their formation, structure, and the role of water in stabilizing the gel state. The discovery of heat-reversible gels has important implications for understanding the relationship between the crystalline and colloidal states.
