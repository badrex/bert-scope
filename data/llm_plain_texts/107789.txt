tldr: The author, John Warren, extends the geometrical representation of algebraic quantities to include powers with indices involving square roots of negative quantities. He introduces the concept of general hyperbolic logarithms and demonstrates how they can be used to represent and manipulate these complex powers. This work expands on previous research in the field and provides a deeper understanding of the mathematical relationships between different types of quantities.
