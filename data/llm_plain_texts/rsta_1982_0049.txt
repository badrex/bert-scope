tldr: This article discusses the principles and applications of electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) for elemental analysis. EELS is an alternative method to X-ray spectroscopy that measures the energy spectrum of electrons transmitted through a thin specimen, providing chemically specific information. The technique is particularly useful for analyzing elements near the beginning of the periodic table and can be used in combination with X-ray spectroscopy for more comprehensive analysis.
