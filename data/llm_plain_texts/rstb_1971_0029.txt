tldr: This article discusses the various signs of human interference on South Island, Aldabra, such as tortoise enclosures, trails, covered rockholes, shell middens, and ballast stones. The author argues that these signs cannot be fully attributed to the lessees' activities and calls for a more detailed chronology of interference to better understand its impact on Aldabra's fauna and flora.
