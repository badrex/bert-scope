tldr: The authors discuss the possibility of detecting alien life by analyzing the thermodynamic properties of a planet. They propose that a planet with a mature biosphere would have distinct surface and atmospheric compositions and energy balances compared to an abiotic state. By observing these properties remotely, it may be possible to identify the presence of a planetary biosphere and distinguish it from other lifeless planets.
