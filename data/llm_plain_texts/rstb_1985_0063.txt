tldr: This study investigates the effects of dopaminergic agents on the antinociceptive response in the spinal cord of rats. The researchers found that dopamine agonists, such as apomorphine, can elevate the tail flick latency, indicating a reduction in pain sensitivity. They also discovered that the D-2 receptor mechanism is involved in this process. Furthermore, the study shows that apomorphine selectively reduces the responses of spinal sensory units to noxious peripheral stimulation, suggesting potential applications in pain management.
