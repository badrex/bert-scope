tldr: This study examines neurofibrillar long-range amacrine cells in mammalian retinas, focusing on their structure and function. These cells are a distinct type of amacrine cell with unique dendritic morphology and long-range processes. They are found in the inner nuclear layer, ganglion cell layer, and inner plexiform layer of the retina. The study provides insights into the role of these cells in the visual processing of the mammalian retina.
