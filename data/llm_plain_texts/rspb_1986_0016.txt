tldr: 'This study examines the effects of ammonium on photosynthesis and the pathway of ammonium assimilation in Gymnodinium microadriaticum, both in vitro and in symbiosis with tridacnid clams and corals. The results show that ammonium ions stimulate photosynthesis in tissue slices but not in isolated zooxanthellae. The study suggests that the glutamine synthase-glutamate synthetase pathway of ammonium incorporation is light-driven in these systems, and discusses the significance of these processes during ammonium recycling by symbiotic algae in marine animals.'
