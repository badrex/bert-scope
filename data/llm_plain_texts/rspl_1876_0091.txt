tldr: The author analyzes the daily range of atmospheric temperature recorded at Kew Observatory from 1855 to 1875, and investigates the relationship between sunspot activity and temperature variations. They find that the daily temperature range is greatest during years of maximum sunspot frequency and suggest that solar activity may play a role in meteorological phenomena.
