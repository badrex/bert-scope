tldr: The authors present a method to study the radiative collision between fast charged particles, focusing on the process where a photon is emitted during the collision. They use the Dirac equation and a correspondence method to analyze the interaction between the particles and calculate the electromagnetic radiation produced. This research contributes to understanding high-energy collisions and the behavior of particles at relativistic speeds.
