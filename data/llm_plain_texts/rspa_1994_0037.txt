tldr: 'The article discusses the process of precise deposition of molten microdrops for digital microfabrication. The authors present a study of various modes of microdrop deposition and solidification, focusing on the conditions required for controlled deposition. They provide experimental results and theoretical analyses for different deposition modes, such as columnar deposition, sweep deposition, and repeated sweep deposition. The study indicates that the solidification angle, which is the apparent contact angle of the solidified melt, appears to be a property of the melt material, target material, and characteristic temperatures involved, independent of the spreading dynamics.'
