tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate the biological effects of homogeneous and heterogeneous X-rays on the allantois of hens' eggs. They found that a homogeneous beam of X-rays had a greater biological effect per unit intensity compared to a heterogeneous beam. The study also demonstrated that there was an antagonism between X-rays of different wavelengths in their biological effects.
