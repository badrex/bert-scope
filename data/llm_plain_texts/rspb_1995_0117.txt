tldr: This study investigates the evolution and phylogeny of Wolbachia, a group of bacteria that infect arthropods and alter their reproduction. The researchers use the ftsZ gene to determine the relationships among different strains of Wolbachia and find that there are two major divisions (A and B) that diverged millions of years ago. They also discover extensive horizontal transmission of Wolbachia between insect taxa and various associations with their hosts.
