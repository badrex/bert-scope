tldr: 'The authors studied the structure of the cell wall in several species of the filamentous green alga Cladophora. They found that the walls consist of layers with cellulose chains in each layer inclined at an angle less than 90 degrees. The two sets of striations on the layers correspond to the directions of the cellulose chains, forming spirals around the cell. The authors suggest that cell elongation and a protoplasmic mechanism may influence the direction of cellulose chains in the cell wall.'
