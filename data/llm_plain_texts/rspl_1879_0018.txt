tldr: The authors developed a method to detect unknown inequalities in a series of solar physics observations, specifically focusing on magnetism and meteorology. They used records of magnetic declination from the Kew Observatory to analyze the data and found that grouping the observations according to various periods could reveal natural inequalities. This research aimed to determine if there is a connection between solar observations, magnetism, and meteorology.
