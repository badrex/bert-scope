tldr: The author examines the granules found in leukocytes and their arrangement in cells. They discover that the granules originate from a thread-like structure in the archoplasm, which grows and eventually breaks up to form the granules. This process is observed in bone marrow cells, and the author suggests that the granules may have a common origin.
