tldr: Researchers used fractal geometry to analyze the patterns of pancreatic islets in normal and alloxan-treated guinea-pigs. They found that islet centers cluster in fractal subsets of dimension less than 3, suggesting that islet regeneration follows the same mathematical dynamics as original islet formation. This study provides a new method for understanding the geometry of pancreatic islet patterns and their role in diabetes.
