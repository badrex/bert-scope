tldr: This article investigates the exchange reaction between deuterium and hydrogen bromide, finding that the chain reaction involving hydrogen atoms is the main cause of the exchange. The results show that the kinetics of the hydrogen bromide reaction differ from those of the hydrogen chloride reaction, with no bimolecular reaction occurring in the HBr case. The study also provides insights into the potential energy surface and the stability of the complex H-Br-H.
