tldr: The author examines the impregnated uterus of a kangaroo, providing insights into marsupial reproduction and the development of marsupial offspring. The study reveals that marsupials have a unique reproductive system, with a double uterus and a complex set of membranes that support the development of the young. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the differences between marsupials and other mammals, such as placental and egg-laying species.
