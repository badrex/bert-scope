tldr: The authors study a boundary-value problem in longitudinal shear with a nonlinear stress-strain law. They use a hodograph transformation and a further transformation to reduce the problem to Laplace's equation for the displacement in terms of appropriate strain variables. They apply the analysis to a semi-infinite crack in an infinite strip with displacement loading along its edges, finding that near the crack tip, a local analysis is not possible, and the asymptotic behavior can only be found from a full analysis of the problem.
