  - Ion channels
  - Membrane potential
  - Fluid secretion
tldr: This article explores the role of calcium in the control of pancreatic acinar fluid secretion. It discusses the importance of calcium derived from intracellular and extracellular sources in coupling fluid and enzyme secretion to hormone-receptor interaction. The study also highlights the involvement of ion currents and membrane potential changes in the process.
