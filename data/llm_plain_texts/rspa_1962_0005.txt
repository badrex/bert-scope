tldr: The authors extend the cluster expansion of the grand partition function to a system of interacting charged particles in a uniform magnetic field. They calculate the magnetic susceptibility of an electron gas for small magnetic fields and find that the equation of state is unaffected by the magnetic field to the Debye-Huckel approximation. The first-order exchange effects are also examined, and the divergence is shown to be removed when ring diagrams are included.
