tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the velocity of sound in Madras, East Indies, using morning and evening gunshots fired from Fort St. George and St. Thomas's Mount. Observations were made at the Madras Observatory with chronometers, and the results showed that the velocity of sound was affected by different atmospheric and weather conditions. The mean velocity of sound deduced from these experiments was 1142 feet per second, closely corresponding to the estimates of Newton and Halley.
