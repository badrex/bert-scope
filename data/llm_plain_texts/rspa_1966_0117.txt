tldr: This article discusses second-order effects in dissipative media, such as viscoelastic, plastic, and strain-hardening solids. The authors report on experiments that observed these effects and present a theoretical framework for understanding them. Second-order effects arise from tensorial nonlinearity in the constitutive equations and can be separated from first-order deformation. The study of these effects helps improve our understanding of materials' behavior under stress and strain.
