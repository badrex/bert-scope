tldr: The Celescope experiment, a survey conducted in the ultraviolet range, aimed to study the distribution of interstellar dust and variations in the extinction law within the galaxy. By analyzing data from the Celescope catalog and ground-based observations, the authors determined the intrinsic properties of stars and the effects of interstellar extinction on their observed colors. This research provided valuable insights into the understanding of stellar atmospheres and the interstellar medium.
