tldr: The author describes a method for measuring stomatal transpiration in adult leaves using a hygroscope made of "Chinese leaf," which is shavings of pressed and heated horn. This method relies on the fact that stomata play a significant role in inspiration, and their degree of openness affects the amount of watery vapor released. The author compares their method to previous techniques using hygroscopic papers impregnated with agents that change color based on their moisture levels.
