tldr: This article discusses the role of cell lineages and genes in animal development. It explores the relationships between cell division patterns, spatial organization, and cell differentiation in embryonic development. The author highlights the importance of fixed and indeterminate lineages, as well as the genetic control of cell specification, in understanding morphological constancy and variation during evolution.
