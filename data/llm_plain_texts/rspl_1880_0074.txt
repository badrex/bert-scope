tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the electrical resistance of thin liquid films and revisited Newton's table of colors. They found that the specific resistance of soap films thicker than 3.74 x 10^-5 centimeters is independent of their thickness and equal to the liquid from which they are formed. The authors also discovered that soap films can lose a significant amount of water if proper precautions are not taken during experiments.
