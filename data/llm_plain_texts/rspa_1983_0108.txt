tldr: The author presents a general analysis of shear lag in thin-walled cylindrical tubes with arbitrary cross sections. They derive two equations that relate the distributions of direct and shearing stresses on the cross section, incorporating equilibrium and compatibility requirements. The study provides corrections to stresses, curvature, and twist calculated from the engineers' theory of bending and torsion, and offers solutions for uniform cross sections under polynomial distributions of bending moment and torque.
