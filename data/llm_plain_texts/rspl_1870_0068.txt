tldr: The author discusses the method of determining a ship's place at sea using celestial and terrestrial spherical triangles. The method requires one observation of the sun's altitude and two assumptions of latitude for longitude calculations. However, the accuracy of the chronometer is crucial for the success of this method. The author warns that incorrect usage of this method may lead to serious dangers for navigators.
