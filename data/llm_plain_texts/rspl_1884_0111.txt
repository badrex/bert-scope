tldr: The author describes their successful experiments with secondary batteries, specifically the Plants type, manufactured by the Elwell Parker Company. They discuss charging methods, the importance of maintaining the correct balance of peroxidised and spongy lead plates, and the use of ebonite grids to prevent short-circuiting. The author also shares observations on the battery's efficiency, capacity, and internal resistance over time, as well as the benefits of periodic reversal to improve capacity and remove irregularities in the battery's performance.
