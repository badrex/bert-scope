tldr: The author investigates the diffraction of high-energy electrons by single crystals of rocksalt, copper, and silver. They observe a pattern of diffracted spots, which they explain using a combination of Bragg's law and de Broglie's formula. This method has the potential to become a valuable tool for studying surface films and materials.
