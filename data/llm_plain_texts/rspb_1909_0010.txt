revised_title: 'Differential Septa and Osmotic Effects'
semantic_tags:
  - Osmosis
  - Membrane permeability
  - Hydration
  - Colloids
  - Diffusion
tldr: The author discusses the osmotic effects and the behavior of substances in differential septa, such as the outer covering of the seed of barley. They explain how substances are classified based on their ability to diffuse through the membrane and how this can help explain selective processes. The author also explores the role of hydration and hydrolation in the behavior of substances and their interaction with membranes.
