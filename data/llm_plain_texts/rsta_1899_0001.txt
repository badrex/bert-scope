revised_title: On the Connexion of Algebraic Functions with Automorphic Functions
semantic_tags:
  - Algebraic functions
  - Automorphic functions
  - Riemann surfaces
  - Group theory
  - Conformal mapping
tldr: The author explores the connection between algebraic functions and automorphic functions, demonstrating how automorphic functions can be used to uniformize algebraic forms. They describe a method for dividing the complex plane into regions corresponding to a group generated by self-inverse substitutions, which can be used to study the properties of automorphic functions and their applications in conformal mapping and algebraic geometry.
