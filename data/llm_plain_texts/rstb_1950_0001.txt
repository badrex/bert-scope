tldr: This study examines the competition for food among larval populations of sheep blowflies, which is an important factor limiting their general population in nature. Both intra- and interspecific competition occur on carrion, with Lucilia sericata being better adapted to withstand the effects of competition. The research highlights the importance of understanding the relationships between fly populations, their environment, and their natural controlling factors to develop effective measures against blowflies.
