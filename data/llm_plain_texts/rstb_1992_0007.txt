tldr: This study investigates the functional and anatomical aspects of face processing using a combination of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans in normal subjects. The results show different patterns of cerebral activation depending on the tasks performed, and reveal a clear dissociation between the neural substrates underlying face and object processing. These findings are compared with data from prosopagnosic patients, providing new evidence regarding the functional neuroanatomy of face and object processing.
