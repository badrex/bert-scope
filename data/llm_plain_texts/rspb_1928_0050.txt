tldr: The author explores the chemical changes in cells using phosphorus poisoning and artificial mixtures to study the behavior of lipins, or fats, in cells. They discovered that phosphorus can alter the appearance of lipins in fixed cell samples, suggesting that the presence of phosphorus in the cell may cause changes in the lipin content. This research provides insight into the complex interactions between lipins and other cellular components, and the effects of chemical changes on cell structure and function.
