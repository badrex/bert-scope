tldr: This article discusses the methods for computing the attractions of spheroids, focusing on the work of Laplace and the critiques by James Ivory. It examines the limitations of Newton's hypothesis and explores alternative methods by D'Alembert and Laplace. The author, Ivory, presents his own critique of Laplace's theorem and its demonstration, particularly when the exponent of the law of attraction is negative.
