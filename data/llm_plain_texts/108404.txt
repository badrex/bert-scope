tldr: The author, Henry Bence Jones, conducted experiments to understand the effect of carbonate of ammonia on the human body and its relation to nitric acid production in urine. He found that after consuming carbonate of ammonia, nitric acid could be detected in the urine, and the amount of nitric acid increased with the quantity of ammonia consumed. The author also observed that exercise after consuming carbonate of ammonia caused nitric acid to appear in the urine more quickly and pass out more rapidly.
