tldr: The author discusses his experiments on electricity and the nature of electric fluids. He examines the behavior of electric fluids in different materials, such as glass, wax, and metals, and concludes that there is resistance exerted on the electric fluid when it passes through certain materials. This resistance causes the accumulation of electric fluid and affects the luminosity observed in experiments.
