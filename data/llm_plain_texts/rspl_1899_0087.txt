tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine if evaporation of an unelectrified liquid produces any electrification. They used fused sodium and observed that a negative electrification occurred. However, when the experiment was repeated with an atmosphere in which sodium could not oxidize, no electrification was obtained. This led to the conclusion that evaporation of fused sodium does not give electrification unless oxidation is going on.
