tldr: The article discusses the evolution of adaptation by natural selection using the Qβ RNA system. The author demonstrates how RNA molecules can evolve resistance to inhibitors, such as ethidium bromide, through mutations. This in vitro system provides a model for understanding the evolution of haploid genomes under natural selection and has implications for theories of the origins of life.
