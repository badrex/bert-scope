tldr: The authors investigate the solubility of two simultaneous cubic equations with integral coefficients, focusing on the p-adic and rational cases. They prove that these equations have a non-trivial solution in every p-adic field if n > 16 and in rational integers if n > 18. The study of these equations has implications for number theory, algebraic geometry, and mathematical analysis.
