tldr: The author presents a family of exact solutions for the problem of steady, irrotational, isentropic, shock-free transsonic flow of a perfect gas through a two-dimensional Laval nozzle using the hodograph method. The study focuses on the flow's characteristics, singularities, and the relationship between the hypergeometric function and Bessel function.
