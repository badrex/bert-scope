tldr: 'Matthew Raper observed the solar eclipse of April 1, 1764, using an 8-foot refracting telescope. He recorded the time of immersion into and emergence from the true shadow, as well as the end of the eclipse. His observations provide valuable data for understanding the event and its impact on the sky.'
