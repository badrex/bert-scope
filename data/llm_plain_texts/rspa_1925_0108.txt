tldr: This article presents a comprehensive study of the optical properties of mixed crystals, focusing on the relationship between the refractive indices of mixtures and their components. The author examines various isomorphous mixtures, including ammonium-magnesium and cesium-magnesium sulphates, and determines that there is a linear relationship between the principal refractive indices of the mixtures and those of the components. This research contributes to the understanding of the behavior of mixed crystals and their potential applications in various fields.
