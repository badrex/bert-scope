tldr: The authors investigated the \#x3BB;2708 and \#x3BB;2756 bands of the OD molecule, which were previously unreported. They analyzed the rotational structure and determined the rotational constants for the molecule. Their findings were compared with the corresponding OH bands, providing insights into the behavior of the OD molecule.
