tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the anaerobic heat production of bull spermatozoa in semen. They found that the heat produced during the first hour of incubation is consistent with the breakdown of fructose to lactic acid. The study provides insights into the energy requirements for sperm movement and the fertilizing capacity of bull semen.
