revised_title: 'Molecular Structure and Function of Contractile Proteins in Skeletal Muscle'
semantic_tags:
  - Muscle Contraction
  - Protein Structure
  - Actin
  - Myosin
  - Tropomyosin
tldr: The authors discuss the molecular structure and function of contractile proteins in skeletal muscle, focusing on myosin, actin, and tropomyosin. They describe the size and shape of these proteins, their role in muscle contraction, and the challenges in understanding their structure and function in living muscle cells.
