tldr: The authors discovered the presence of the element gallium in clay-ironstone from the Cleveland district of Yorkshire and in the Bessemer metal. They identified the presence of gallium through the examination of flame spectra at high temperatures and the analysis of various substances separated from the ore and metal. This finding expanded the understanding of the rare element's presence in different materials.
