tldr: 'The author, John Flamsted, observed the solar eclipse of May 1/12, 1706, at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich. He used a seven-foot telescope and smoked glasses to view the eclipse. The observations included the Moon's effect on the Sun's light and the appearance of a red streak of light before the Sun's body emerged from the total eclipse. This phenomenon suggests that the Moon has an atmosphere, and its short duration indicates that its height is only a small fraction of its diameter.'
