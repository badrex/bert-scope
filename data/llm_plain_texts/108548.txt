tldr: The author, E. Frankland, discovered a new series of organic bodies containing metals, specifically tin, and described the synthesis and properties of one such compound, iodide of stanethylium (C4H3SnI). This compound, formed by reacting iodide of ethyl with tin, has unique properties and reactions, and is soluble in ether and alcohol. The author also discussed the formation of other organometallic compounds and their potential applications.
