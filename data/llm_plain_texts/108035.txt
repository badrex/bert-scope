tldr: 'Edward J. Johnson conducted magnetic experiments on an iron steam-vessel to study the effects of iron on compasses and navigation. He observed the deviation of compasses in various positions on the vessel and compared the results with observations made on land. The findings showed the impact of iron on compass accuracy and the importance of considering magnetic influences in navigation.'
