tldr: The author observed new band systems in the hydrogen spectrum using a limited electron stream and low pressure. They identified two band systems, with the main nucleus line being at 3650 Ã…. The bands were degraded towards the violet, and each line had a fainter component on the long-wave side. The final states of these bands appeared to be the same as the initial states of the Lyman series in the far ultra-violet. The intensity of the lines exhibited a pronounced alternation, and the initial and final vibration term differences were analyzed.
