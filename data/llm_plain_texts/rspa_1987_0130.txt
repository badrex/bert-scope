tldr: The authors study the effects of various sources, such as electromagnetic fields, perfect fluids, and null dust, on the development of horizons when plane gravitational waves collide. They find that electromagnetic fields do not significantly affect horizon development unless the gravitational wave polarizations are parallel. Perfect fluids can decisively affect horizon development, while null dust prevents the formation of horizons and allows only space-like singularities.
