tldr: The authors explore the implications of non-conservation of baryons in cosmology, introducing a new field called the C-field. They discuss its effects on the structure of cosmological equations and how it can help avoid the problems of singularities in Friedmann cosmologies. The C-field also prevents singularities in the theory of relativity, but further research is needed to understand its full implications.
