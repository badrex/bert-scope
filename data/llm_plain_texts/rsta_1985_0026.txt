tldr: This article discusses the cycling of trace elements in bottom sediments and the role of bioturbation in their distribution. It highlights the importance of understanding early diagenetic reactions and the influence of bioturbation on element transport in the ocean. The author also explores the potential role of organometallic compounds, such as copper porphyrins, in the cycling of metals in bottom sediments.
