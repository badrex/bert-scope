tldr: This article discusses the concepts of bond energies, bond lengths, and bond dissociation energies in chemical bonds. It explores the differences between homobonded and heterobonded molecules and the importance of thermochemical measurements in understanding these concepts. The article also examines the relationship between bond energy and bond dissociation energy, and the methods used to measure these quantities.
