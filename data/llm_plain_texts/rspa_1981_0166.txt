  - Boundary-Value Problems

tldr: The authors present a uniqueness theorem for reflector mappings in the complex plane, which arise in geometrical optics and antenna design. They focus on the Monge-Ampere equation and its elliptic properties, providing a boundary condition for reflector mappings. The theorem has practical applications in the design of single and offset dual reflectors for radar and communications purposes.
