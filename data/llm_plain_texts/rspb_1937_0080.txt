revised_title: 'Calcium Metabolism and Permeability in Shore Crabs'
semantic_tags:
  - Calcium metabolism
  - Shore crab
  - Crustacea
  - Permeability
  - Moulting process
tldr: The study investigates the calcium metabolism and permeability of the shore crab, Carcinus maenas, focusing on the moulting process and the crab's ability to absorb calcium ions from sea water. The research shows that the boundary membranes of the crab are permeable to calcium ions, and the calcium concentration in the blood and tissues is affected by the external calcium concentration. The antennary gland may play a role in controlling the ionic composition of the blood.
