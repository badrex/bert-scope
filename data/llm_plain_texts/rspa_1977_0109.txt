tldr: The author discusses the possibility of quarks decaying into leptons within the context of a unified gauge theory of strong, weak, and electromagnetic interactions. They propose that quarks may decay leptonically or semi-leptonically, with specific selection rules. The author also explores the concept of preons, which could be the building blocks of quarks and leptons, and the implications of these findings for the understanding of particle physics.
