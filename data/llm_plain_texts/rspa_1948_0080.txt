tldr: The authors conducted experiments to demonstrate the electroviscous effect in ionic liquids, confirming the theoretical predictions made in a preceding paper. They observed the approach of a quartz lens to a quartz plate in various liquids, including water, methyl alcohol, toluene, and ether, and found no significant difference in the distance of separation between the surfaces when the liquids were present. This study provides evidence against the existence of high equilibrium distances of separation and thick compressible solvate layers at liquid interfaces.
