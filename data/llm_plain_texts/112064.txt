tldr: The author, W. Snow Harris, investigates the laws and operation of electrical force, focusing on the relationship between surface area, boundary extension, and electrical charge. They develop a formula that explains how electrical charge depends on surface area and linear extension together, and how electrical intensity varies with surface area and boundary extension. This research helps to better understand the behavior of electrical forces and the capacity of surfaces to accumulate charge.
