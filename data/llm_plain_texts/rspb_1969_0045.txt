tldr: The author discusses the phenomenon of algal blooms, specifically blue-green algae, which can be a nuisance in bodies of water due to their impact on water quality, fish populations, and human health. The author explores the factors that contribute to the development of these blooms, including nutrient enrichment, organic pollution, and the physiological characteristics of the algae themselves. They also touch upon potential control measures and the importance of understanding these blooms for the health of aquatic ecosystems.
