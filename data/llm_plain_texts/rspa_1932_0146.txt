tldr: The authors present a modified method for counting particles, which improves accuracy and efficiency compared to the standard method. The new method is particularly useful in situations where counting is difficult or time-consuming, such as in bacteriological laboratories. The authors also discuss the application of the modified method in various particle concentrations and demonstrate its advantages over the standard method.
