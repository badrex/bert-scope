tldr: Researchers developed a technique for spectroscopy at extreme infra-red wavelengths using a helium cryostat and interference filters. They determined the refractive index of quartz and studied its properties in the range from 150 to 300 microns. This technique allowed them to investigate transmission maxima and solve problems related to the construction of spectrographs.
