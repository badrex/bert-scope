tldr: The authors conducted a series of experiments to measure the changes in atmospheric air and oxygen gas during respiration. They used an eudiometer to accurately measure the amount of carbon dioxide produced and the oxygen consumed. The results showed that the human body gives off carbon dioxide at a rate of about 26.55 cubic inches per minute and consumes oxygen at a similar rate. The authors also found that the faster the respiration, the more carbon dioxide is given off and the more oxygen is consumed.
