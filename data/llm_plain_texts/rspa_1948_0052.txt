tldr: The authors investigate the mechanism of the steam-carbon reaction and the role of adsorption in the process. They find that steam dissociates into hydrogen and hydroxyl radicals, which react with carbon. The adsorption of hydrogen and oxygen on the charcoal surface is studied, and the authors propose a mechanism that explains the reaction's kinetics and the effect of hydrogen and carbon dioxide on the reaction rate.
