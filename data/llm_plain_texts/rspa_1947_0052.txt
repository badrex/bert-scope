tldr: The authors studied the photosensitized polymerization of vinyl acetate using benzoyl peroxide. They found that the rate of polymerization is influenced by the concentration of peroxide and the intensity of light. The results suggest that the reaction involves free radicals and that the inhibition of the reaction is due to the presence of peroxide molecules. The authors calculated the velocity coefficient for the initiation reaction and found the energy of activation for this step to be 8.7 kcal/gmol.
