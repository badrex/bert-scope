tldr: The author, Captain F. W. Beechey, conducted observations on the tidal streams of the English Channel and North Sea under the authority of the Admiralty in 1849 and 1850. He found that the tidal streams in these areas corresponded in every important aspect and were influenced by a combined wave. The study provides a better understanding of tidal phenomena and can be useful for navigation, as it offers a common standard for referring to the movement of the stream.
