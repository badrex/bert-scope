tldr: The author studied the spectrum changes in the variable star β Lyr and discovered two separate sources of light giving dark line spectra. The relative movement between these sources causes periodic changes in the spectrum, with the maximum relative velocity of 156 miles per second. The study also found that the spectra of the two components resemble Rigel and Bellatrix, indicating that they are not of an unfamiliar type.
