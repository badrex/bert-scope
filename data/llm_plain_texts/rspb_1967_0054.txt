tldr: The author discusses the concept of obligate parasitism in fungi, focusing on the biochemical and physiological factors that contribute to their dependence on living host cells. The lecture covers various categories of parasitism, including ecologically and physiologically obligate parasites, and highlights the challenges in cultivating these fungi in axenic culture. The author also presents examples of fungal groups that are considered obligate parasites, such as downy mildews, white blisters, club-root pathogens, and powdery mildews, which have significant economic impacts on crop plants.
