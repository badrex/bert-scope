tldr: The study records observations of respiratory pressure and flow in various unanaesthetized animals, including dogs, sheep, goats, cows, pigs, donkeys, mules, horses, chickens, and ducks. The patterns of air flow in and out of the lungs were measured using a flow transducer attached to a mask. The study found that while there were differences in the rate and depth of pulmonary ventilation among species, the overall patterns of air flow were similar. The study also discovered a double phase during expiration in adult donkeys, mules, and horses, which was not observed in young animals.
