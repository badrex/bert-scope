tldr: The author examines the retinal structure and visual cells of the coelacanth, Latimeria chalumnae, using electron microscopy. They discover four types of visual cells, with most being rods and three types of cones. The retina's structure and the presence of a choroidal tapetum lucidum suggest adaptations to the dimly lit deep waters where the coelacanth lives. This research provides insights into the evolution of the vertebrate eye and its adaptations to different environments.
