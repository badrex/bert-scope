tldr: The author investigates the swelling of charcoal when exposed to different alcohols and analyzes the stoichiometric relations of the resulting films. They find that branched-chain alcohols cause larger expansions than their straight-chain isomers and have a slower rate of adsorption. The study also compares the results with data from Cassel and Salditt, who measured the surface tension of mercury with organic liquids' unsaturated vapors.
