tldr: This study investigates the sperm precedence pattern in harlequin beetle-riding pseudoscorpions when females mate with multiple males. The researchers found that last-male sperm precedence breaks down when females mate with three males, unlike in two-male mating experiments. This suggests that the opportunity for post-copulatory sexual selection may be greater in nature than previously thought. The findings have implications for understanding the impact of female promiscuity on sexual selection and reproductive success in natural populations.
