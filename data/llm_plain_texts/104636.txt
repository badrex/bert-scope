tldr: James Short describes the design and uses of an equatorial telescope, a portable observatory that allows for precise astronomical observations during the day and night. The instrument can find the hour of the day, the meridian of the place, and locate stars, planets, and other celestial objects. It also serves as an equal altitude instrument, transit instrument, theodolite, quadrant, azimuth instrument, and level.
