tldr: The authors investigated the initial expansion observed when light falls on a mixture of hydrogen and chlorine. They discovered that the expansion is due to a rise in temperature caused by the formation of hydrochloric acid. The combination process is influenced by the presence of water vapor and the preliminary illumination of chlorine. The study also suggests the formation of intermediate compounds and a period of induction in the reaction process.
