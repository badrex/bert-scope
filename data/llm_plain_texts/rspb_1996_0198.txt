tldr: Researchers studied the ability of migrating butterflies and moths to compensate for wind drift during their journey. They found that butterflies like Aphrissa statira and Marpesia chiron can adjust their headings to account for wind drift, while moths like Urania fulgens cannot. The butterflies may use two landmarks or the vector motion of the surface beneath them as orientation cues. This knowledge is essential for understanding insect navigation and mapping migration flyways for conservation purposes.
