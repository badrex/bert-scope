tldr: The article presents a method for inferring population history from molecular phylogenies using coalescence theory. The authors develop graphical methods to navigate through hypothesis space, with two landmarks for reference: constant population size and exponentially growing population size. They apply this method to real data, illustrating its potential for studying population dynamics and evolutionary history.
