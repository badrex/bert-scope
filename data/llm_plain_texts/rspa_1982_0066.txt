revised_title: Gravitational Energy and the Bel-Robinson Tensor
semantic_tags:
  - Gravitational energy
  - Bel-Robinson tensor
  - Hawking's quasi-local energy
  - General relativity
  - Stress energy pseudo-tensor
tldr: The authors explore the connection between Hawking's quasi-local energy integral and the Bel-Robinson tensor. They find that the leading-order contribution to Hawking's integral is the energy density of matter, while in the absence of matter, the dominant contribution is the Bel-Robinson tensor, which can be viewed as a measure of gravitational energy.
