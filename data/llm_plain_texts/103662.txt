tldr: The author examines P. Souciet's claims about the location of the first star in the constellation of Aries and compares them to Hipparchus's observations. By analyzing the data provided by Hipparchus, the author concludes that the first star of Aries was actually the 22nd star in Pisces, supporting Sir Isaac Newton's chronology.
