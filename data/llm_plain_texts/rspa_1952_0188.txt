tldr: 'The thermal conductivities of solid helium crystals at various densities were measured at liquid-helium temperatures. The specific heat of solid helium was also determined at these densities. The results support the "umklapp" type of thermal resistance theory proposed by Peierls. This research provides valuable information about the mechanisms responsible for thermal resistance in dielectric solids.'
