tldr: This study investigates the genetics and evolution of Muellerian mimicry in Heliconius butterflies. By hybridizing races of Heliconius melpomene and H. erato, researchers found that the races differ at multiple genetic loci, which contribute to the butterflies' color patterns. The study also explores the effects of inter-ring capture and geographical variation on the evolution of mimicry in these butterflies.
