tldr: In 1744, John Martyn received a unique fungus from a painter, which had been found on an elm tree in a damp cellar. The fungus had a spongeous, dusky-red substance with cream-colored tips and a funnel-like shape. Martyn classified the fungus as a new species of Boletus, based on its characteristics and its distinction from other known species.
