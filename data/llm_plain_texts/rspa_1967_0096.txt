tldr: The authors discovered a new absorption spectrum in the flash photolysis of borine carbonyl, which can be unambiguously assigned to the free BH2 radical. They analyzed the spectrum and found that the molecule is linear in the excited state and bent in the ground state. The electronic transition fits well with the Walsh diagram for molecules, and the molecular constants and geometrical data were evaluated.
