tldr: The authors study the effects of forced oscillations in a simple isothermal, bimolecular surface reaction model. They find various responses, including subharmonic, quasi-periodic, and chaotic solutions, and identify different bifurcation features such as folds, period doubling, Hopf bifurcations, homoclinic tangles, and codimension-two bifurcations. This research can help understand the response of nonlinear systems and has potential applications in chemical engineering, process control, and analytical laboratory studies.
