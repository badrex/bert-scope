tldr: This article discusses the use of intensity fluctuation spectroscopy (IFS) to study Brownian motion. IFS measures the temporal fluctuations in the intensity of scattered laser light, providing insights into the behavior of particles in a fluid medium. The authors review the principles and methods of IFS and apply it to the study of Brownian motion, focusing on the velocity autocorrelation function of a single particle and related quantities. They also explore the effects of particle interactions and the role of long-time tails in the decay of the autocorrelation function.
