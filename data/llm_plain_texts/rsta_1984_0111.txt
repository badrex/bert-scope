tldr: This article explores the onset of chaos in quantum optics systems with a homogeneous gain line and specific relaxation constants. It discusses the coexistence of multiple attractors and the role of external noise in bridging these attractors. The authors analyze various experimental situations, such as lasers with modulated losses, ring lasers, and lasers with injected signals, and compare the resulting power spectra with theoretical predictions. The study reveals a scaling law that relates the control parameter and external noise in their effect on the mean escape time from a given stability region.
