tldr: This study examines the presence and distribution of carotenoids in Daphnia, small crustaceans, and how light affects their carotenoid content. Carotenoids are found in the gut wall, fat cells, and ovary of Daphnia. The amount of carotenoid-protein in the blood increases during development and then decreases when the next batch of eggs is laid. Light exposure promotes the deposition of carotenoids in Daphnia, with females reared in the light containing three times as much carotenoid as those reared in the dark. The carotenoid pigments in Daphnia have been identified as /?-carotene, y-carotene, lutein (esterified), and astaxanthin (part esterified). The study also observes a change in carotenoid distribution during the development of embryos, with carotenoid-protein moving from the cytoplasm of fat cells to the fat globules as the embryos mature.
