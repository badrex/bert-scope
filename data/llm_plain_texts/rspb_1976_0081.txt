tldr: The article discusses the long-term culture of leech ganglia and the changes in neuronal properties that occur over time. The researchers found that sensory and motor nerve cells in isolated ganglia maintained in culture continue to function normally for up to ten weeks. They also observed changes in synaptic transmission between sensory and motor nerve cells, which can double in size and duration over a period of about two weeks in culture. After more than three weeks, synaptic potentials disappear, and the ganglia lose transparency.
