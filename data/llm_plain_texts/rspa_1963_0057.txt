tldr: This study investigates the causes of trajectory inconsistency in high-velocity gun systems, focusing on the initial disturbances affecting the direction of a shot fired from a gun. The research evaluates the relative importance of various factors, such as gun barrel movements, aerodynamic effects, and disturbances in the blast zone, to improve gun accuracy and reduce inconsistencies.
