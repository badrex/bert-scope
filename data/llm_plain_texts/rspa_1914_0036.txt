tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the electrical condition of a gold surface during the absorption of gases and their catalytic combustion. They found that the gold surface becomes negatively electrified during the process, and the electrical effect is due to occluded gas leaving the metal. The authors also observed that the temperature plays a significant role in the electrical charge and the rate of gas absorption.
