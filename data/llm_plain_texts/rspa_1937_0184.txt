tldr: The author investigates the behavior of an osglim lamp using oscillograph methods and explores small and large oscillations. They describe the techniques used to measure voltage and current, and discuss the effects of capacitance, stray currents, and ionization currents on the lamp's behavior. The study aims to find an equation to describe the osglim's behavior under all non-destructive circumstances.
