tldr: The authors present a two-band model to study the magneto-resistance effects in metals. They derive general formulae for the effect of a magnetic field on the electrical and thermal conductivities of a metal with two overlapping bands of normal form. The study discusses the behavior of electrical resistance at low temperatures and shows that the Lorenz number is generally increased by the presence of a magnetic field.
