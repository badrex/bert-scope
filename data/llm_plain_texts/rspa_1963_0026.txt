tldr: The authors studied the hydrocracking of lower saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons in the presence of excess hydrogen over evaporated metal films of nickel, tungsten, rhodium, and platinum. They measured reaction rates, activation energies, and frequency factors, and found that the rate of hydrocracking over nickel and possibly tungsten and rhodium is desorption-controlled, except for reactions within a quaternary group. The study provides insights into the mechanisms of hydrocracking and the role of different catalysts in the process.
