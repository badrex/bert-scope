tldr: The authors quantize the electromagnetic field in a system with half of space filled with a dielectric material and the other half empty. They calculate the vacuum electric field fluctuations and spontaneous emission rates inside and outside the dielectric. The results show significant modifications near the dielectric interface, which can be useful for understanding and controlling the behavior of light and matter interactions in various applications.
