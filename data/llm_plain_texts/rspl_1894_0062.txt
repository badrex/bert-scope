tldr: This article discusses the production of sounds by certain siluroid fishes, specifically through the vibration of air within the air-bladder. The authors describe the role of the "elastic spring" apparatus and the paired extrinsic muscles in sound production, and acknowledge the contributions of Dr. William Sorensen, who conducted experiments on living fish. The findings challenge previous assumptions about the purpose of these structures in fish adjustment to varying hydrostatic pressures.
