revised_title: Relaxation Methods Applied to Engineering Problems: Free Transverse Vibrations of Membranes and Electromagnetic Systems
semantic_tags:
  - Vibrations
  - Electromagnetic oscillations
  - Relaxation techniques
  - Membrane analogy
  - Boundary conditions
tldr: This article explores the use of relaxation methods to study free transverse vibrations of membranes and their application to two-dimensional oscillations in electromagnetic systems. The authors apply these techniques to calculate natural modes and frequencies of vibrating flexible membranes and demonstrate their effectiveness in solving complex engineering problems.
