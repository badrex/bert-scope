tldr: The authors propose an evolutionary hypothesis to explain the development of color vision and how the eye perceives colors. They suggest that the visual apparatus of color-seeing species, like humans, was once only able to distinguish light from darkness and that colors were seen as shades of gray. Over time, the eye evolved to perceive colors in relation to environmental pigments. The authors also explain why certain colors appear as shades of gray under certain conditions and how the combination of spectral rays in natural pigments contributes to the perception of color.
