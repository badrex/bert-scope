tldr: The author describes a case where a significant portion of the upper arm bone was removed and successfully regenerated. The patient's arm was treated using a special device to maintain the proper distance between the bone pieces during the regeneration process. This case demonstrates the potential for bone regeneration in adults and the effectiveness of surgical intervention in treating fractures.
