tldr: The authors present experimental methods for determining line widths in vibration-rotation bands of diatomic molecules when broadened by foreign gases. They explain the basis of these methods, which involve measuring relative self- and foreign-gas-broadening coefficients, equivalent line widths, or peak absorbance values of lines across a band. The authors compare their results on self-broadening of CO and DC1 with previous data and discuss the validity of their methods under the conditions used for the measurements.
