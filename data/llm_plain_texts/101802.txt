tldr: Edmund Pitt, a botanist from Worcester, discovered a rare fruit called Sorbus Pyriformis growing wild in the county. This fruit, previously only known to grow in France, Germany, and Italy, is now found to be native to England as well. Pitt discusses the fruit's resemblance to the Ornus or Quicken Tree and suggests that a verjuice made from this fruit could be a valuable, acidic-astringent sauce in cooking.
