tldr: The author investigates the factors that influence the size of drops formed by liquids falling from various surfaces and geometries. They find that the size of a drop is affected by the curvature of the surface from which it falls, the adhesion between the liquid and the solid, and the geometric distribution of the solid. The study helps to understand the behavior of drops in various applications, such as medicine dispensers and the formation of raindrops.
