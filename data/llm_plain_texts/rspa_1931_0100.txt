tldr: The author investigates the crystal structures and growth of lead chloride, lead bromide, and mercuric bromide under various conditions. They discover that the presence of organic colloids, such as dextrine, can cause the crystals to form in less symmetrical structures than expected. The study includes X-ray examinations and analysis of the arrangement of atoms in the crystal structures, providing insights into the factors influencing crystal growth and symmetry.
