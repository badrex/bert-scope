tldr: This article presents a method to determine the static and dynamic yield stresses of a material using a steel ball. The author explains the theoretical background and experimental procedure, and provides numerical calculations for the stress distribution in the material. The results show that the ratio of dynamic to static yield stress increases as the hardness number decreases.
