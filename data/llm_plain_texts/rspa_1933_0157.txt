tldr: The author presents a new type of expansion apparatus for cloud-chamber experiments that is easier to construct and more versatile in size and positioning compared to the traditional form. The new design allows for better control of pressure changes and maintains a consistent electric field within the chamber, resulting in high-quality track photographs.
