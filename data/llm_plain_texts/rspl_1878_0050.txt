tldr: The author, Captain Abney, investigated the effect of different wavelengths of light on the oxidation of silver bromide emulsions. He found that the least refrangible end of the spectrum, or red light, accelerated the oxidation process. This discovery has implications for the development of photography and understanding the behavior of light on various materials.
