tldr: The author investigates the effect of temperature on the anomalous reflection of silver. They discovered that the reflection coefficient decreases in the neighborhood of a specific wave-length, and the band shifts towards shorter wavelengths as the silver is cooled. The study suggests that the cause of this effect may be related to the electron lattice and the restoring force acting on the vibrating electrons.
