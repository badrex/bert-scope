tldr: This article discusses experiments conducted to understand the effect of pressure on the temperature of an electric arc's crater. The authors found that the temperature of the crater depends on how much it is cooled by the surrounding gas, rather than being the temperature at which the vapor of carbon has the same pressure as the surrounding atmosphere. They also discovered that the differences in temperature measurements were mainly due to light absorption in the long tube used for observations.
