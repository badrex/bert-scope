tldr: The study investigates the development of the corneal surface ultrastructure in nocturnal Lepidoptera, focusing on the formation of corneal nipples. The research shows that microvilli and MV/LE bridges play a crucial role in corneal topography formation. The findings can be applied to understand the morphogenesis of body cuticle in insects and the development of the compound eye.
