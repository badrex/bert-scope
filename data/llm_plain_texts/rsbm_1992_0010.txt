tldr: The article is a biographical memoir of Hans Kuypers, a prominent neuroanatomist who made significant contributions to the field of brain research. Kuypers was known for his innovative use of microanatomical methods to trace neuronal pathways in the brain, particularly those connecting the cerebral cortex, brainstem, and spinal cord. His research focused on understanding the cerebral control of movement and the development of new methods to study the brain's structure. Throughout his career, Kuypers worked closely with W.J.H. Nauta, who had a significant influence on his research career and the development of his teaching skills.
