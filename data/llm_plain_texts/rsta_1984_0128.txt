tldr: The authors report the first observations of bifurcation routes to chaos in an all-optical resonator. They generate deep and sustained Ikeda oscillation of smooth laser input pulses at twice the round-trip time of the Fabry-Perot resonator, creating a high-frequency passive optical modulator device. The results are in excellent agreement with the adapted optical bistability theory to the time-dependent regime, showing the transition to chaos in a passive all-optical resonator.
