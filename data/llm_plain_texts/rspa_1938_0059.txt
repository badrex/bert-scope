tldr: The authors investigated the absorption spectra of sulphur dioxide and carbon disulphide in the vacuum ultra-violet range. They discovered that the bands in the spectra have a complicated structure and irregular spacing, which they attribute to the influence of neighboring electronic states. The study provides insights into the electronic structure and potential applications of these molecules.
