tldr: This study investigates the uptake of radioactive potassium, rubidium, and phosphorus in the metabolism of Bact. lactis aerogenes. The authors found that the flow of alkali cations and phosphate anions into the cell occurs in parallel during the early stages of growth or glucose oxidation. The dehydrogenase and deaminase activities are affected by pH and can be compensated for by the uptake of potassium or rubidium ions. Protective responses to adverse pH involve absorption of alkali-metal ions and adaptive changes during growth.
