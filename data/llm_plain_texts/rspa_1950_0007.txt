tldr: The article discusses the equilibrium swelling of cross-linked amorphous polymers, considering the effects of external restraints and stress on the swelling process. The authors derive a general equation that determines the relationship between stress, strain, and concentration in a swollen polymer network. They also explore specific cases, such as tensile stress and inflation, and compare the equilibrium swelling behavior under different conditions.
