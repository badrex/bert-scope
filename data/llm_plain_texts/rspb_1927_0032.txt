tldr: The authors investigated the substances causing an increase in diamino-nitrogen during protein hydrolysis. They discovered that the increase was due to the presence of a base called di-lysine, which had not been previously recognized as a normal hydrolysis product of proteins. The study found that the main increase in nitrogen was due to a substance resembling arginine, while a smaller increase was due to a substance resembling lysine.
