revised_title: 'Interpretation of Anisotropy in the Cosmic Background Radiation and Element Creation'
semantic_tags:
  - Cosmic Microwave Background

  - Anisotropy
  - Element Creation
  - Galaxy Formation
tldr: This article discusses the mechanisms for producing temperature and polarization anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background radiation. It explores the relation between these anisotropies and the large-scale distribution of matter, as well as theories of galaxy formation. The authors also review possible sources of ambiguity in interpreting data and strategies for removing these ambiguities.
