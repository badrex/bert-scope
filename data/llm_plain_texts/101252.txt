tldr: In this letter, Signor Cassini shares his observations of spots on the planet Venus. He noticed a bright part in the middle of Venus's disk and two dark spots near the eastern ring. Cassini observed the motion of these features, concluding that the bright part moved from south to north and the dark spots had irregular motion. He could not definitively determine if the bright part was due to revolution or libration, but he estimated that the motion completed in less than a day.
