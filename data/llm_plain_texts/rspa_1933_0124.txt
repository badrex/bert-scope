tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments to determine whether alpha-particles enter the nucleus by resonance or over the top of the potential barrier in nitrogen disintegration. They also investigated the energy distribution of the produced protons. The results showed that the alpha-particles enter the nucleus by resonance, and the protons produced have a narrow energy range.'
