tldr: This study investigates the non-mitochondrial calcium ion regulation in rat ventricular myocytes. Researchers found that the non-mitochondrial fraction of the cell has a large capacity for calcium accumulation and can significantly contribute to tension relaxation in rat cardiac muscle. The findings suggest that both non-mitochondrial and mitochondrial fractions of the cell can reduce the sarcoplasmic concentration rapidly enough to account for the observed transient nature of the isometric twitch.
