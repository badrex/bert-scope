tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the factors affecting electric conduction in various materials. They discovered that the conductivity of metals and other materials increases when heated, and that the electric fluid flows more easily through hot materials. The author also explained the phenomenon of volcanic lightning, attributing it to the easy passage of the electric fluid through the rarefied air in the volcanic crater.
