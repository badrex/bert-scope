tldr: The author conducted experiments to study how the pitch of sound changes when it passes through different materials. They discovered that porous materials, like wood, lower the pitch, while dense materials, like iron, raise the pitch. The author also found that the intensity of the sound decreases as it travels through the material, which affects the pitch alteration. This research helps to understand how sound travels and changes in various media.
