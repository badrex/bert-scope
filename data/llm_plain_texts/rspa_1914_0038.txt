tldr: The authors argue that sulphuric acid is not a true dibasic acid and propose a new view that it is more similar to lactic acid. They also discuss the properties and structure of other polybasic inorganic acids, carbonic acid, and hydrated basic oxides, raising questions about the nature of salts in general.
