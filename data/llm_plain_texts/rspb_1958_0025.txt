revised_title: 'Protein and Nucleic Acid Synthesis in Enucleate Cytoplasm'

  - Protein synthesis
  - Nucleic acid synthesis

  - Cytoplasm
  - Enucleation
tldr: The author's experiments with unicellular organisms, such as Amoeba and Acetabularia, show that protein and nucleic acid synthesis can occur in enucleate cytoplasm. This suggests that the majority of cytoplasmic proteins are formed within the cytoplasm itself, rather than in the nucleus. However, some discrepancies between Amoeba and other materials indicate that further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between the nucleus and cytoplasm in protein and nucleic acid synthesis.
