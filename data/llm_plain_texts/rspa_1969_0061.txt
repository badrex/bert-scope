tldr: The authors present a method to determine energies and wavefunctions with full electronic correlation using a transcorrelated Hamiltonian. They show that this method only requires the evaluation of pseudo six-dimensional integrals, making it possible to calculate wavefunctions for larger systems. This approach provides a solution to the problem of including all quantities in wavefunctions, which has been discussed for over thirty years.
