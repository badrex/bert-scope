tldr: The article investigates the image of a single point in microscopes with large numerical aperture. It shows that the image is no longer independent of the illumination and the numerical aperture of the condenser. The image is radially symmetric for unpolarized illumination but not for oblique illumination. The image of a single point is no longer independent of the numerical aperture of the condenser, and it no longer exhibits zeros in intensity unless either the condenser or objective aperture is zero.
