tldr: "The authors used radioactive tracer methods to study sputtering processes in metallic targets by ionic beams. They found that atoms are ejected instantaneously from depths of several atomic diameters, and the angular distribution of sputtered atoms deviates from the cosine law due to the contribution of atoms from finite depths within the target."
