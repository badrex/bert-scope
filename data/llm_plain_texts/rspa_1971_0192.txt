tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the magnetostriction constants of nickel at different temperatures using the strain gauge technique. They found that the temperature variation of the magnetostriction and anisotropy constants did not follow the predicted power laws, leading to questions about the accuracy of previous measurements and the need for further research.
