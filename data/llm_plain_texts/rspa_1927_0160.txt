  - Electromagnetic Potential
  - Electromagnetic Waves
tldr: The author explores the interaction between electromagnetism and gravitation in different gravitational fields, specifically focusing on the quasi-uniform field and the field due to a single attracting center. They derive equations for determining the electric potential in these fields and discuss the electric potential due to a single point-charge and spherical electromagnetic waves in the presence of a gravitational field.
