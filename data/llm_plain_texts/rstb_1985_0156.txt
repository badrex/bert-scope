tldr: This study examines an 18-meter core sample from Lake George, Australia, to analyze pollen, spore, algal, and charcoal particle data from 730,000 to 0 years before present. The research provides a detailed understanding of vegetation, fire, lake level, and climate changes during the Late Cainozoic era. The findings reveal significant past changes in terrestrial temperatures, precipitation levels, and the expansion of Eucalyptus-dominated forests due to increased fire frequencies.
