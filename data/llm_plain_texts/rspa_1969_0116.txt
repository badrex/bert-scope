tldr: The article explores the properties of geodesic orbits and bifurcate Killing horizons in a four-dimensional Lorentz manifold. It classifies geodesic orbits into complete and incomplete orbits and shows that incomplete, extendable geodesic orbits define fixed points. The article also defines a bifurcate Killing horizon as the union of intersecting Killing horizons and establishes a theorem that relates Killing horizons to incomplete, extendable, null geodesic orbits.
