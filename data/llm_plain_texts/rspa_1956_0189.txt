tldr: The authors studied the inclusion complexes formed between faujasite and paraffins and permanent gases. They investigated the sorption properties of faujasite and found that it can selectively occlude nitrogen from other gases, suggesting potential for gas separation applications. The study also demonstrated the reproducibility and reversibility of the isotherms for various hydrocarbons and gases.
