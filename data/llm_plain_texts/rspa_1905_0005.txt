tldr: This article explores the relationship between variations in atmospheric pressure in North-East Africa and the Nile flood. The author finds that similar pressure anomalies are closely related to the excess or deficit of monsoon rainfall in Abyssinia, which consequently affects the Nile flood. The study examines available data on atmospheric pressure and rainfall, revealing a connection between pressure conditions in North-East Africa and weather conditions in other regions.
