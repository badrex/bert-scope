tldr: The authors investigated the ureides of p-aminophenylstibinic acid, focusing on their trypanocidal activity against Trypanosoma equiperdum. They found that the di-substituted urea, p-diphenylurea-4:4'-distibinic acid, had the highest trypanocidal activity. The study also discussed the challenges in synthesizing and purifying the active substance due to the complex mixture of colloids present in the initial product.
