tldr: This article discusses the methods used to measure nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from soil, focusing on the use of small and large flux chambers. The authors examine the advantages and disadvantages of these methods and present data from recent studies. They also explore the environmental importance of N2O emissions, as they contribute to global warming and ozone depletion, and highlight the need for accurate measurements to better understand their impact on the environment.
