tldr: This article examines the value of sunspot observations in understanding solar activity trends on a centennial to millennial timescale. It discusses the limitations of older data and the importance of the sunspot record during the telescopic and pretelescopic eras. The article also explores the use of auroras as an alternative source of information, but concludes that sunspot data is more reliable for studying solar activity.
