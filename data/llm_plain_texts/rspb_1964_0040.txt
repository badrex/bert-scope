tldr: The study investigates the transmission of antibodies and normal globulins across the young mouse gut. It shows that the maximum concentration of these proteins in the serum is reached 2 hours later, regardless of the amount or specificity of the proteins administered. The results support the receptor hypothesis, which suggests a specific receptor within the absorptive cells of the gut that protects the attached protein from proteolysis and conveys it to the blood or lymph.
