tldr: The authors conducted experiments on electric distribution in electrolytes, focusing on the distribution of ions in copper sulphate solutions. They discovered that the distribution of ions is influenced by factors such as temperature, current strength, and solution strength. The authors also found analogies between the distribution of ions and static electricity and discussed the implications for electrolytic fields.
