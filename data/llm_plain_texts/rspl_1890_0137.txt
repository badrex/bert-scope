tldr: The author conducted experiments on steel and observed the simultaneous liberation and absorption of heat, known as recalescence, and the change in magnetic condition. They found that both temperatures of heat liberation are associated with a change in magnetic condition. This study contributes to the understanding of steel's magnetic properties and heat behavior.
