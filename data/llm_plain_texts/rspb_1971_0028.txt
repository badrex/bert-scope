tldr: This article discusses the importance of understanding the biological effects of pollution in the sea and the need for better information on waste disposal. It highlights the challenges in assessing the impacts of pollution on marine life and ecosystems, and the importance of setting limits and recommending practical measures to prevent hazards to human health, damage to living resources, and interference with maritime activities. The article also emphasizes the need for long-term population studies to evaluate the effects of less obvious and immediate pollution levels.
