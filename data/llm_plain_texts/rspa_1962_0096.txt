tldr: The authors study the structure of the electrical double layer in the presence of adsorbed aliphatic molecules, focusing on the mercury/aqueous sodium perchlorate interface with -amyl alcohol. They find that the change in the dielectric constant due to the adsorption of aliphatic molecules with their hydrocarbon group towards the mercury is the key feature of these systems. They derive an equation that accounts for the peculiarities of the differential capacity curves and apply it to published data, finding that the adsorption curves for -amyl alcohol agree with other available data and obey the Langmuir isotherm at the electrocapillary maximum.
