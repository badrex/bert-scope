tldr: The author, Monsieur Hauton, conducted experiments on animals to discover an alternative passage of urine. He found that by tying the ureters and making the animal drink water, he could observe the urine being excreted through a different route. Hauton also shared his findings on the salubrious effects of distilled seawater, which he believed was due to the mixture of a specific earth that blunted the sharpness of the salt's volatile spirits.
