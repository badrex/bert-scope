tldr: John Masson Gulland was a prominent organic chemist who made significant contributions to the fields of morphine chemistry, nucleic acids, and seaweed research. He worked on the chemistry of morphine bases and made important discoveries in the structure of these alkaloids. Gulland also conducted research on nucleic acids, applying physical methods such as absorption spectra measurements and electrometric titrations to the complex structural problems in this field. Additionally, he played a key role in the founding of the Scottish Seaweed Association and contributed to the development of the seaweed industry in Scotland.
