tldr: The authors use molecular orbital theory to study the structure of water and similar molecules. They find that lone pair electrons play a significant role in determining the equilibrium configuration and contribute to the total dipole moment. The study also examines the distribution of molecular and equivalent orbitals in water and ammonia molecules, providing insights into their electronic structure and properties.
