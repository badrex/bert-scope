tldr: This article presents a theoretical analysis of buoyant vortex rings and their behavior in uniform and stratified fluids. The authors develop a theory based on the perfect fluid approximation, assuming constant circulation and impulse of a ring. They predict that increasing buoyancy leads to a greater rate of expansion and a lower velocity of rise. The observations suggest that this analysis may be applicable to phenomena on a larger scale in the atmosphere, such as explosion clouds.
