tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the refractive indices of gaseous nitric oxide, sulphur dioxide, and sulphur trioxide. They found that the refractivities of these gases deviate significantly from the additive values, with decreases of nearly 20% and 23.2% for sulphur dioxide and sulphur trioxide, respectively. The authors also discussed the refractivity of gaseous sulphuric acid and compared it to other sulphur compounds.
