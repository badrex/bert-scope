tldr: The author develops a formalism to express the equations of motion of non-holonomic systems in Poisson form, using locally free variables and constrained variables. They also study Hamilton's principal function and its properties, showing that it is a non-integrable function. The theory is applicable to the development of non-holonomic quantum mechanics.
