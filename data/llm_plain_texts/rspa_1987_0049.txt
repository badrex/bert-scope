tldr: The authors developed a measurement technique for studying corona discharges in electrical systems. They used a double-electrode system to determine the rate of charge carriers at the collector electrode and the electric field strength. The technique was applied to 50 Hz corona discharges from 100 and 500 diameter wires, providing a complete budget of space-charge behavior under various conditions. This method can be adapted for different geometries, voltages, and practical testing on high-voltage lines, ion sources, and electrostatic precipitators.
