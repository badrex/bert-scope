tldr: This paper continues the author's previous work on the Calculus of Symbols. It calculates the general values of coefficients in the Binomial Theorem and provides an expression for the coefficient of the general term in the Multinomial Theorem. The author also presents a theorem for multiplying symbolical factors and investigates a binomial theorem that is a reciprocal to the previously considered binomial theorem.
