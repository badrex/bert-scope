tldr: The study investigates the correlation between MHC genotype and male ornamentation in pheasants. It shows that MHC genotype is associated with variation in both male spur length and male viability, supporting the Hamilton-Zuk model, which predicts that females choose mates based on their genetic disease resistance, improving offspring fitness.
