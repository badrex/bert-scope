tldr: The authors investigate the nature of the carrier of the diffuse interstellar bands, proposing that transition metal ions interacting with oxidic lattices could be responsible for these features. They discuss the challenges and correlations associated with this hypothesis and present experimental research on the photophysical and photochemical properties of interstellar grain mantles to further understand the chemistry of the interstellar medium.
