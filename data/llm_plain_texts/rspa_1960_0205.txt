tldr: The article discusses the infra-red chemiluminescence observed in the reaction systems of atomic hydrogen with chlorine, atomic hydrogen with hydrogen chloride, atomic hydrogen with deuterium chloride, and atomic deuterium with hydrogen chloride. The study provides details of the infra-red spectra obtained from these systems, which include resolved spectra of the HCl fundamental transitions in the ground electronic state, partially resolved first overtones, and, in one system, unresolved second overtones. The findings support the view that the major part of the heat of an exothermic exchange or association reaction goes into the vibration of the new bond formed.
