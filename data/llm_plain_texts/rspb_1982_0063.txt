tldr: The study investigates the effects of black widow spider (Latrodectus) venom on sensory and motor nerve terminals in muscle spindles. The venom causes acute degeneration of sensory terminals, followed by regeneration, restoring the complex annulospiral endings. This research provides insights into the impact of spider venom on sensory systems and nerve regeneration.
