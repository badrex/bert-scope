tldr: This article discusses the use of intense ion beams for creating hot dense plasmas, focusing on the reasons for using ion beams over lasers, understanding ion-plasma interactions, and the production and focusing of these ion beams on targets. The authors explore the potential of ion-driven systems for inertial confinement fusion and highlight the importance of effective charge states in the process.
