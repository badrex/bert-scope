tldr: 'The author proposes a mathematical model of a growing embryo, suggesting that a system of chemical substances called morphogens reacting together and diffusing through tissue can account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis. The model considers the chemical and mechanical aspects of the state, focusing on the onset of instability and the formation of patterns in organisms. This theory provides a possible mechanism by which genes determine the anatomical structure of an organism.'
