tldr: The Oman ophiolite is studied as a fragment of a Cretaceous arc-basin complex formed above a short-lived subduction zone. The article provides geological and geochemical evidence to understand the magmatic and tectonic development of the complex. Four main events are recognized before the emplacement: eruption of basalts, creation of new oceanic crust, intrusion of magma, and further intrusion accompanied by uplift and eruption in submarine graben. The study helps explain the extensional tectonics and magma genesis in currently and recently active basins.
