tldr: The authors conducted nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies on ion-pairs derived from dihydroanthracenes and their lithium salts. They found that neither the molecules of these hydrocarbons nor their lithium salts are planar, and the carbon 9 atoms in the anions possess a considerable amount of sp2 character. The study provides insights into the stereochemistry and conformation of these compounds, which can help in understanding their properties and potential applications.
