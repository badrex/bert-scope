  - Fermi surface
  - Copper
  - Anomalous skin effect
  - Crystal orientation
  - Surface resistance
tldr: The author conducted experiments on single crystals of pure copper to study the anomalous skin effect and determine the shape of the Fermi surface. By measuring the surface resistance at different crystal orientations, they constructed the Fermi surface, which holds one electron per atom. The experimental value of the Fermi surface is 138, and it is believed to be a unique solution. This method can be applied to other simple metals like silver and gold.
