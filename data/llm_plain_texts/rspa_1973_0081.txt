tldr: The article presents a study on the dispersion relation and wave solution for anharmonic lattices and Korteweg-de Vries continua. The authors reduce the set of coupled difference equations describing the dynamics of a monatomic chain to uncoupled anharmonic oscillators using the translational invariance of the equations. They then use Poincare's perturbation scheme to obtain a space- and time-wise periodic wave solution and a nonlinear dispersion relation between frequency, wavenumber, and amplitude. This solution suggests a class of solutions for the generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation, which is related to the long-wave limit of the nonlinear lattice through a semi-characteristic variable stretching transformation. The authors present numerical results for the dispersion relations using semi-empirical Morse, Born-Meyer, and Lennard-Jones potentials.
