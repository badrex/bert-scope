tldr: The article investigates the association between human leukocyte antigens (HLA) and malaria in African populations. It finds that certain HLA alleles, such as HLA-B53 and HLA-DRB1*1302, are associated with resistance to severe malaria. The study supports the idea that pathogen-driven selection has played a significant role in maintaining MHC (major histocompatibility complex) diversity in human populations.
