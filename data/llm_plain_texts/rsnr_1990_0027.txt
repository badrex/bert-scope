tldr: This book review discusses Donald Cardwell's biography of James Joule, a central figure in the history of modern physics. Joule's experiments on the mechanical equivalent of heat and his contributions to the dynamical theory of heat and thermodynamics are highlighted. The review praises Cardwell's exploration of manuscript and printed sources, as well as his ability to present Joule's life and work in a broad social and scientific context. Joule's partnership with Thomson (Lord Kelvin) and his involvement in engineering, railway, and steamship construction are also discussed.
