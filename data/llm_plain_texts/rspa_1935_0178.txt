tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the explosive antimony, studying its structure, electrical conductivity, and rate of crystallization. They discovered that the deposits have a heterogeneous gel-like structure oriented with respect to the cathode surface. The electrical properties of the deposits have a very small conductivity with a positive exponential temperature coefficient. The deposits crystallize at a rate independent of the extent to which they have already crystallized.
