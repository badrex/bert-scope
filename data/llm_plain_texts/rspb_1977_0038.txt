tldr: Researchers discovered that Aedes eggs harbor microbial colonies that influence hatching. The number of bacteria acquired by each egg affects its hatchability. This phenomenon ensures that a proportion of eggs remain unhatched, serving as a reserve for the future. The findings provide a new understanding of erratic hatching in Aedes eggs.
