tldr: The authors present a model of a double sheath between two plasmas, considering reflected particles and the initial velocities of accelerated particles. They find that ions from the plasma sac acquire kinetic energy in a presheath region, and the ratio of ion and electron current densities can significantly deviate from Langmuir's 1:1 ratio. This model helps to understand double sheaths in various contexts, such as solar flares and gas-discharge tubes.
