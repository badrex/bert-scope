tldr: The authors apply the method of previous papers to a two-dimensional model of an antiferromagnetic and develop an alternative notation to analyze the antiferromagnetic and order-disorder transitions. They find that in the presence of a magnetic field, the antiferromagnetic is effectively identical to the ferromagnetic. The authors also discuss the behavior of an antiferromagnetic at absolute zero and the entropy's relationship with magnetic field and temperature.
