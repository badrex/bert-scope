tldr: The authors studied the colonization of the Krakatau Islands by land birds and analyzed the approach to an equilibrium number of species. They used data from various surveys, including a crucial data point from 1951, to examine the bird colonization and turnover on the islands. The results showed that the first resident land birds colonized the Krakataus one or two decades after the 1883 eruption, and the newly emergent island, Anak Krakatau, provides an ecological refuge for species that depend on open habitats.
