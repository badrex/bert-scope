tldr: The author examines the brains of various British cyprinoid fish species and correlates their brain structures, specifically the vagal and facial lobes of the medulla oblongata, with their feeding habits. The study reveals differences in brain structures and the presence of taste buds in different fish species, which are related to their feeding habits and the types of food they consume. The research also highlights the importance of the palatal organ and the role of taste buds in the fish's feeding behavior.
