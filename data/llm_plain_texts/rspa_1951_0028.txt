tldr: The authors present a new approach to the statistical thermodynamics of multicomponent systems, focusing on conformal solutions. They introduce a set of assumptions and equations to calculate the configurational free energy of a conformal solution, which can be applied to liquids and gases. This theory allows for a better understanding of the thermodynamic properties of mixtures and their interactions.
