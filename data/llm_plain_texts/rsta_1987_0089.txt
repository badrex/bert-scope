tldr: This article investigates the orbital evolution of asteroidal collision debris produced within 2.6 AU to determine the regions responsible for producing Earth-crossing meteoritic material and Apollo objects. The study finds that the region near the 3:1 jovian commensurability resonance and the innermost asteroid belt provide the necessary conditions for the production of ordinary chondrites and basaltic achondrites. The research also suggests that enstatite achondrites may originate from the Hungaria region, and iron and stony-iron meteorites may come from various main-belt sources within 2.6 AU.
