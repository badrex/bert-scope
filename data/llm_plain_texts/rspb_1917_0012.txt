  - Foetal influence
  - Corpus luteum
tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the causes of the mammary gland's development in rabbits during the second half of pregnancy. They found that the foetus plays a significant role in this process, contrary to the commonly accepted opinion that the corpus luteum is responsible. The maternal placenta does not cause milk secretion, and the myometrial gland, suggested by Ancel and Bouin, was not found in the rabbits studied.
