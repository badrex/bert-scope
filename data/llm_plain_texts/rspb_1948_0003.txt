tldr: This article discusses the physiology of resistance to disease in plants, focusing on the facultative type of parasite. It explores the differences between facultative and obligate parasites, their growth and behavior, and the factors affecting their invasion of host plants. The author also examines the role of environmental conditions, spore germination, and host tissue in the process of parasitic attack.
