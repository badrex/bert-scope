tldr: This article discusses the role of cosmic strings in the early universe and their potential to provide the fluctuations that lead to galaxy formation. The authors review the theories that predict cosmic strings, their formation conditions, and the evolution of the string system. They also present evidence from the correlation of clusters and an alternative scenario where lighter strings might dominate the recent universe.
