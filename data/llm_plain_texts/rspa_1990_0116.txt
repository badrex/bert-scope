tldr: The author studies eight-dimensional ternary composition algebras and their automorphism groups. They focus on the properties of type algebras and the linear operator on the Lie algebra so(E) associated with the algebra. The author derives a "principle of duplicity" for the ternary multiplication and provides a four-dimensional "complex" construction of the algebra.
