revised_title: On the Existence of a Milk-Curdling Ferment in the Pancreas
semantic_tags:
  - Digestive enzymes
  - Pancreas
  - Milk curdling
  - Proteolytic ferment
  - Rennet
tldr: The author discovered that the pancreas contains a milk-curdling ferment, distinct from the proteolytic ferment, which acts similarly to rennet from the calf's stomach. This finding challenges the notion that milk curdling is solely the property of the gastric ferment.
