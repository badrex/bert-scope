tldr: This article discusses the numerical construction of space-time in general relativity. The author presents a practical algorithm for solving the nonlinear Einstein field equations, focusing on the decomposition of space-time into spacelike time slices and a congruence of curves. The article also explores the role of black holes in generating gravitational radiation and the efficiency of gravitational radiation generation during the collision of two black holes.
