tldr: The author, Thomas Young, examines the functions of the heart and arteries, focusing on blood pressure and resistance. He calculates the dimensions of the arterial system and the velocity of blood flow, determining that the resistance created by the arteries is significant. Young also investigates the effect of different substances on the viscosity of blood and concludes that the resistance of the arterial system is crucial for blood circulation.
