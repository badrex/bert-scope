tldr: This paper introduces and develops the notion of support functions for fuzzy sets, providing a new approach to investigate properties of fuzzy valued functions. The authors explore aspects of measurability, integrability, and measure theory, and establish connections between support functions and conditional expectations. This research contributes to the understanding and application of fuzzy set theory in various scientific fields.
