revised_title: 'Exploring the Benthic Boundary Layer: Life, Food Supply, and Resuspension in the Deep Sea'
semantic_tags:
  - Benthic boundary layer
  - Deep sea biology
  - Food supply
  - Resuspension
  - Organic matter flux
tldr: The article discusses the benthic boundary layer, a zone near the deep sea floor that is enriched in biomass and species. It explores the factors contributing to this enrichment, such as food supply from sedimenting organic material, and the role of resuspension in distributing organic matter throughout the layer. The article also highlights the unique communities and adaptations found in this environment, including chemosynthetic activity at hydrothermal vents and seeps.
