tldr: The authors studied the absorption spectrum of the component c of cytochrome, a protein found in yeast cells. They extracted and obtained the pigment in a suitable form for spectroscopic examination. The main feature of the cytochrome spectrum is the intense absorption band in the extreme violet, which is characteristic of heme compounds. The position of this band is slightly different in the oxidized and reduced forms, with reduction causing a shift towards the red end of the spectrum. The study provides insights into the structure and function of cytochrome c and its role in cellular respiration.
