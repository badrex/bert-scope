tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the absorption of agglutinin by bacteria and found that the interaction between bacteria and agglutinin does not follow the formula C = kBn proposed by Arrhenius. Their results contradict Arrhenius's theory on the equilibria in absorption processes, and they discuss the implications of their findings for understanding the nature of the immune response.
