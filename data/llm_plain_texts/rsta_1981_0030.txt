tldr: The article introduces multiple-pulse nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques in solids, focusing on symmetrized pulse sequences. These methods help reduce dipolar interactions and other second-rank tensor interactions, leading to improved resolution and more detailed information on chemical bonding and solid-state electronic structures. The authors review the development and operation of these techniques and present new results and applications.
