tldr: The authors propose a new interpretation of atomic structure that is compatible with recent magnetic observations. They suggest that diamagnetic molecules are complex systems formed by at least two magnetic components, the orbiting electrons. The authors also discuss the behavior of crystals in a magnetic field and how their orientation can reveal the structure of their atomic components.
