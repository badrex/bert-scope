tldr: 'Researchers James Dewar and Alexander Scott conducted experiments to determine the molecular weights of potassium and sodium. They found that the new determinations of the molecular weights were about half the former values, suggesting that the atoms of these metals, like mercury and cadmium, have similar molecular volumes in the gaseous state. The results indicate the need for further investigation of secondary reactions at high temperatures and the use of platinum or iridium vessels in future experiments.'
