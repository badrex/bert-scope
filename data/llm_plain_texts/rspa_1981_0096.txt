tldr: This study investigates the yield stress of single crystals of -phase copper-aluminum alloys and examines the composition dependence of the yield stress. The research measures the stress at 293 and 4.2 K under precisely defined conditions to determine whether the Friedel or Mott-Labusch relation applies. The results show a dependence of the yield stress on the composition of the alloy, providing insights into the mechanisms of solute hardening in metals.
