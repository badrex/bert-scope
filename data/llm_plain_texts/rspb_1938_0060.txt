tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the mechanism of oestrogenic activity using synthetic compounds and ovariectomized mice. They developed a method to measure oestrogenic activity by analyzing the extent of vaginal cornification in the mice. The results showed that certain synthetic compounds had similar oestrogenic potency as native hormones, suggesting a possible unifying hypothesis for their varied types of behavior in living organisms.
