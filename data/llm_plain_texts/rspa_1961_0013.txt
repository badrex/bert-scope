tldr: This article explores singular hypersurfaces in relativistic magneto-fluid-dynamics, focusing on the Einstein-Maxwell equations and their applications. The author investigates the properties of these hypersurfaces, which are essentially weak shock waves in space-time, and discusses their potential development into shock waves under specific initial and boundary conditions.
