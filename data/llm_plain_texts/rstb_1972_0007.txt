tldr: A study was conducted on an iodine-deficient population living in the Karakoram Himalayas to understand the incidence of goitre. The findings showed that the incidence of goitre increased towards the lowest part of the village, and the population had exceptionally low levels of iodine. Intra-muscular injections of iodized oil were administered to the villagers to help combat the issue. The study also found no correlation between goitre incidence and bacterial concentration of drinking water.
