tldr: The authors explore the application of Fourier's double integrals to optical problems, specifically the representation of non-periodic light radiation. They demonstrate the connection between Fourier's calculus and physical analysis of light, discussing applications such as incandescent gas radiation, Rontgen rays, and radiative damping of molecular vibrations.
