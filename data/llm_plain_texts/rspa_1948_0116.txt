tldr: This study examines the deformation of metals under static and sliding contact, focusing on the formation of metallic junctions and the role of lubricants. The research provides evidence that frictional force in both clean and lubricated surfaces is mainly due to the shearing of metallic junctions formed by cold welding at points of intimate contact. The findings have implications for the burnishing of metals and the behavior of bearing alloys.
