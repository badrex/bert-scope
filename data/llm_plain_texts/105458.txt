tldr: The author, Hugh Hamilton, presents a new theory on evaporation and the ascent of watery vapours, arguing that it is not solely caused by heat and rarefaction. He suggests that evaporation is a gradual solution of water in air and compares its properties and effects with those of common solutions. This theory can help explain the ascent of vapours and other atmospheric phenomena.
