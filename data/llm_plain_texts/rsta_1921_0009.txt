tldr: The author investigates the problem of equilibrium in an elastic solid under applied forces using bipolar coordinates. They establish a theorem that allows for the application of the two-dimensional theory to the average stresses through the thickness of a plate, with modified elastic constants. The author provides solutions for various problems, including an infinite plate with two circular holes, a semi-infinite plate with a straight edge and a circular hole, and a circular disc with an eccentric circular hole.
