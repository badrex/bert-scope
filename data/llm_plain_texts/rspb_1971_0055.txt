tldr: This study investigates the autotrophic nutrition of symbiotic marine coelenterates, specifically hermatypic corals, and the movement of photosynthetic products between the symbionts. The researchers found that small quantities of fixed carbon were released from the tissues of the coelenterates, and the rate of release was increased in the presence of glycerol, glucose, and alanine. The results suggest that zooxanthellae play a role in supplying organic nitrogen compounds to the host cell and may help explain the success of corals in nutrient-poor seas.
