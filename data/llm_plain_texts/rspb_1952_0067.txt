tldr: This study investigates the metabolic changes in potato tubers under anaerobic conditions, focusing on the formation of carbon dioxide, lactic acid, and other products. The research shows that the previous history of the potato material significantly affects the relative magnitudes of alcohol and lactic acid formation. The findings provide a basis for further research on the biochemical mechanisms of plant tissues and their similarities to animal metabolism.
