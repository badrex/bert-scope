tldr: "Henry Cabourn Pocklington was a solitary but content man, dedicated to mathematics, physics, and astronomy. He worked as a schoolmaster, spending much of his time helping students with genuine interest in science. Pocklington rejected other opportunities, including a chair of mathematics in Cape Town and a fellowship at St John's College, Cambridge, due to his aversion to social interactions. He made significant contributions in optics and astronomy, particularly in the field of sugar crystal polarization. Pocklington's life was marked by his love for science and his dedication to education."
