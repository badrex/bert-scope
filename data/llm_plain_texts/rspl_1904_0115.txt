tldr: The author investigated the presence of tyrosinases in the skins of pigmented animals, such as rabbits, rats, and guinea pigs, to understand the formation of pigments in their coats. They found that extracts from these animals' skins could act upon tyrosin and produce pigmented substances, with black substances formed from animals with black pigment and yellow substances from those with orange pigment. These colored substances are soluble in alkalis but insoluble in acids.
