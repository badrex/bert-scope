tldr: The article discusses the observations and analysis of Russian artificial earth satellites conducted at the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory in Cambridge. The observations aimed to provide approximate information on the orbit to assist in accurate visual and radar tracking and to investigate ionospheric effects. The authors describe the methods used, including interferometers, Doppler recorders, direction-finding equipment, and radio telescopes, and present the results of their observations, which contributed to the understanding of the satellites' orbits and the study of the atmosphere.
