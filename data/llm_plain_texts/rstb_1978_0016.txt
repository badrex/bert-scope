tldr: This study examines the rhabdomere organization and adaptation in nocturnal spiders of the Pisaurid genus Dolomedes. The retinae of these spiders have unique features, such as large receptors and swollen receptor axons. The researchers found that prolonged illumination causes the rhabdomeres to lose membrane, which is restored in darkness. The supportive cell system plays a crucial role in recycling the products of rhabdomere breakdown. This study provides insights into the adaptation strategies of spiders and their photoreceptor membrane manipulation.
