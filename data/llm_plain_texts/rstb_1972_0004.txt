tldr: This article discusses the geological and paleontological findings on Chiloe Island, southern Chile, during the Royal Society expedition in 1958. The island is composed of schist, Tertiary sediments, fluvioglacial deposits, and volcanics. The authors describe the various geological features and formations, as well as the fossil invertebrates collected from the deposits, which are attributed to the Lower Pliocene. The findings contribute to the understanding of the geology and paleontology of the region.
