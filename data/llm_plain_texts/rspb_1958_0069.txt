tldr: The authors discovered that feeding plays a crucial role in the hatching process of barnacles. They found that a substance produced by barnacle tissue, called the hatching substance, is secreted into the mantle cavity when the adult barnacles feed. This substance stimulates the embryos within the egg cases to hatch, ensuring the release of larvae when food is available. The study also investigated the effects of physical factors, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide tension, on the hatching process, and found that these factors do not play a significant role in initiating hatching.
