tldr: This article discusses the evolution of the eukaryotic cell cycle, focusing on the differences between bacterial and eukaryotic cell cycles. It explains how eukaryotic cells evolved from bacterial ancestors, with the development of the endo- or cytoskeleton enabling the evolution of the mitotic spindle and a new means of segregating sister chromatids. The article also highlights the role of cyclin-dependent kinases in regulating the cell cycle and the importance of surveillance mechanisms to ensure proper cell division.
