tldr: The authors studied the interaction of oxygen and hydrogen sulphide with Pb(100) and Pb(110) single crystal surfaces using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and low-energy electron diffraction. They found that oxygen interaction with both crystal planes resulted in the growth of orthorhombic oxide on both Pb(100) and Pb(110), while hydrogen sulphide dissociated on pre-oxidized surfaces, leading to surface sulphidation. The study provides insights into the structural aspects of surface reactions and the role of oxygen-hydrogen interaction in the sulphidation process.
