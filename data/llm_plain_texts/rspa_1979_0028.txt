tldr: The author decouples the equations governing the perturbations of the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole using the Newman-Penrose formalism. They transform these equations into one-dimensional wave equations for odd and even parity perturbations, showing a simple relation between solutions of opposite parities. This work provides a better understanding of the conversion of gravitational and electromagnetic energy in spacetimes described by the Einstein-Maxwell equations.
