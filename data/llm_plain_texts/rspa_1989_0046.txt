tldr: The article discusses recent advances in the study of diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA), a model that helps understand various growth and morphogenesis processes. The authors describe different algorithms and techniques used to simulate DLA in two-dimensional and three-dimensional spaces, focusing on the structure and properties of the resulting clusters. They also present results on the fractal dimensionality and growth of DLA clusters, highlighting the importance of this model in understanding complex natural phenomena.
