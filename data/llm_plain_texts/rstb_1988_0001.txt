tldr: This article discusses the history and current state of biological control, which uses living organisms as pest control agents. It examines challenges and opportunities in the field, including conflicts of interest, debates over the ecological and genetic basis of successful control, and the role of biological control in integrated pest management. The article also highlights the different techniques used in biological control, such as introduction, inoculation, augmentation, and inundation, and their respective successes. It concludes that despite the dominance of chemical pesticides, biological control has a firm place in pest management and is not likely to be dislodged.
