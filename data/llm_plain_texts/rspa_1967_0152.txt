tldr: The authors developed a general theory for quasi-static crack propagation in materials, focusing on the stability of crack propagation and the local specific work of crack spreading, or fracture toughness. They described experiments in which cracks were spread quasi-statically, allowing for the determination of fracture toughness without calculating the elastic stress distribution or measuring the test piece's shape. The study also explored scale effects and provided insights into crack propagation in various scenarios, such as rods embedded in a medium and bending cases.
