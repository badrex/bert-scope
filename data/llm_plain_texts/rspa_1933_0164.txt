tldr: The authors reevaluate the internal conversion coefficient of beta-rays, providing a new method for calculating the probability of beta-ray emission by considering the whole system of the nucleus and electron. They also discuss the electromagnetic field radiated by the system and its effect on the outgoing beta-ray wave.
