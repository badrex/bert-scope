tldr: The author discusses a spherical vortex and its properties, focusing on the motion of fluid with rotational and irrotational components. They explore the conditions for a limiting surface containing the same fluid particles and the relationship between the rotational motion inside and outside the sphere. The study involves mathematical expressions and the use of ellipsoids to understand the fluid dynamics.
