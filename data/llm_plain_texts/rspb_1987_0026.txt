tldr: The author discusses the molecular control of normal and leukemic granulocytes and macrophages, focusing on the discovery of colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) that regulate their proliferation and functional activity. CSFs have potential applications in treating infections and managing some types of leukemia. The author also describes the development of semisolid culture methods that enabled the study of these cells and the identification of specific humoral regulators.
