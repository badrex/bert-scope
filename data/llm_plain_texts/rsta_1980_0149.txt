tldr: This article presents experimental and computational evidence for the coexistence of multiple-chain silicates within an amphibole host in nephrite. The authors used various techniques, including electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction, to analyze the internal structure of nephrite and understand the relationship between different types of silicates and their host structure.
