tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the formation of ice in plant tissues and protoplasm. They observed that the cell membrane can act as a barrier delaying or preventing ice from invading the cell. The study provides insights into the effects of freezing on plant cells and the mechanisms of freezing injury.
