tldr: The authors propose a unified field theory in a curvature-free five-dimensional manifold, where fields are identified with the properties of the observer and their measuring system. They show that the inverse square law of force holds for both electromagnetic and gravitational fields, and explain the connection between these two forces through the gravitomagnetic effect.
