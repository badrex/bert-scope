tldr: 'The author, M. Faraday, discovered a method to convert chlorine into a liquid state by exposing the solid hydrate of chlorine to a temperature of about 100 degrees Celsius. The liquid chlorine has a bright yellow color and a specific gravity of about 1.33. Sir Humphry Davy also announced his success in obtaining muriatic acid in a liquid form by causing sulfuric acid and muriate of ammonia to act upon each other in a sealed tube. He suggests that other gases may be condensed into a liquid form using a similar method.'
