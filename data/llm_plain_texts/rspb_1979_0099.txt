tldr: The authors studied the oncofoetal antigens of human trophoblasts, which are proteins found in the cells that make up the placenta. They discovered that these antigens are present in some transformed human cells, suggesting a possible role in the host-parasite relationship of human pregnancy and cancer. The selective localization of these antigens at the interface of the mother and fetus indicates that they may play a biological role in maintaining the successful relationship between the mother and the developing fetus.
