tldr: This article explores the dynamics of rigid bodies using screw theory, a mathematical framework for studying the motion and force of rigid bodies. The author discusses the energy required to twist a body, the concept of virtual coefficients, and the use of coreciprocal screws. The article also covers the sexiant function, the relationship between impulsive and instantaneous screws, and the determination of principal screws of kinetic energy. The author applies these principles to various scenarios, including two and three degrees of freedom.
