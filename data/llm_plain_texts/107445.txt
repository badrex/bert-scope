tldr: The author conducted a series of observations on the natural production of saltpetre in various buildings, focusing on the Ashmole Museum's laboratory. They discovered that the presence of limestone and specific atmospheric conditions, such as temperature and humidity, are crucial for the formation of saltpetre. The author also found that the presence of lime in building materials is necessary for the natural production of saltpetre.
