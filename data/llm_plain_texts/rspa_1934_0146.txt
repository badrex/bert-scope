tldr: The authors explore the internal conversion of gamma-rays and introduce the possibility of magnetic multipole radiation in addition to electric multipole radiation. They calculate the internal conversion coefficients for magnetic multipole radiations and find them to be much larger than those for electric multipole radiation. However, they conclude that the proportion of magnetic radiation in actual nuclei is likely too small to significantly affect the calculated internal conversion coefficients.
