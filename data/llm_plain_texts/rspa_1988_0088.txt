tldr: This article investigates the behavior of autocatalytic reaction-diffusion equations, focusing on the effects of coupling reaction with diffusion across a boundary. The study explores multiple stationary states, sustained oscillations, and transient behavior in these equations, providing insights into the complex patterns and responses of chemical reactions in various systems. The findings have implications for understanding and modeling chemical processes in both open and closed systems.
