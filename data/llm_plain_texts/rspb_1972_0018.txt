tldr: The article discusses the excavation of a freshwater deposit at Derryvree, Maguiresbridge, County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland, revealing a Middle Midlandian freshwater series. The study provides insights into the glacial and paleoenvironmental conditions of the area during the full glacial period, with a 14C date of 30,500 years BP. The findings indicate open tundra vegetation and a periglacial climatic regime in the region at that time.
