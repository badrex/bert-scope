tldr: The author conducted experiments on the effects of temperature on glass and its impact on polarized light. They discovered that when glass is heated and then cooled, it forms two images and polarizes them in an opposite manner, similar to double-refracting crystals. This phenomenon can be observed in glass tears or Rupert's drops, which exhibit alternating prismatic colors when exposed to polarized light. These findings have implications for understanding the structure of crystallized bodies and the nature of double refraction.
