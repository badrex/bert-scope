tldr: This article presents a general expression for the induced electromotive force in an electromagnetic flowmeter for poorly conducting fluids with dielectric and magnetic properties. The theory is a generalization of the one known for conducting fluids and can be used to measure the flow of insulating fluids or fluids of very low conductivity, which has applications in industries, medicine, waterways, and ship's logs.
