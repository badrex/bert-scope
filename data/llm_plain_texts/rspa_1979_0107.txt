revised_title: 'Sources of Gravitational Waves in General Relativity'

  - Gravitational Waves

  - Neutron Stars
tldr: The authors discuss various violent cosmic events, such as supernova explosions, pulsations of black holes, rapid rotation of neutron stars, and collisions between neutron stars and black holes, which should produce copious amounts of gravitational radiation. These gravitational waves can pass through surrounding matter unimpeded and provide detailed information about the dynamics of matter and space-time curvature in these events.
