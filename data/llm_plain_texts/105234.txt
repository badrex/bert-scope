tldr: The author, William Borlase, discovered submerged trees on the shore at Mount's Bay in Cornwall. The trees, including oak, hazel, and willow, were found buried under the sand and submerged in water. Borlase used this discovery to support the local tradition that St. Michael's Mount once stood in a wooded area. He also discussed the implications of earthquake subsidence and its relationship to the preservation of the trees and the potential for future earthquakes.
