tldr: The Kew Committee at Kew Observatory, Richmond, Surrey, conducted various observations and experiments in 1891, including magnetography, meteorology, atmospheric electricity, and sunspot studies. They reported increased terrestrial magnetic activity and provided data to various institutions. They also tested new wind and weather instruments and made cloud photographs. The electrograph experienced reduced sensitivity due to battery charge loss, leading to further investigation by Professor J. J. Thomson.
