tldr: The authors conducted a study on the autoionizing resonances of the helium isoelectronic sequence using a perturbation expansion method. They found that the positions and widths of the 2s2p and 2p2s autoionizing resonances can be determined by optimizing the screening parameter and using a finite, correlated basis set. This method helps identify specific autoionizing states and provides accurate results for resonance positions and widths.
