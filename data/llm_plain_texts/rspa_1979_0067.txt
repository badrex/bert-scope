  - Hadamard Strain-Energy Function
tldr: This article examines the Barnett-Lothe theory of elastic surface waves in a pre-stressed body. It explores the properties of surface waves in anisotropic elastic materials and provides a complete account of the existence of surface waves in a pre-stressed body composed of a restricted Hadamard material. The article also discusses the implications of surface wave analysis for the surface stability of the equilibrium configuration.
