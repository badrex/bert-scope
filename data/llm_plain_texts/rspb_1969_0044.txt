tldr: The author examines the motor apparatus of the baboon's hand through electrical stimulation of the cortex. They investigate the actions of cortical stimulation on corticospinal pyramidal neurons and the differences in surface-anodal and surface-cathodal thresholds. The study provides insights into motor control and the role of the motor cortex in primates.
