revised_title: 'Exploring the Connection between Luminosity and Radioactivity'
semantic_tags:
  - Radioactivity
  - Luminosity
  - Molecular changes
  - Isomeric change
  - Triboluminescence
tldr: The authors investigate the connection between luminous manifestations and radioactivity, suggesting that both may be outcomes of oscillatory changes in molecular structure. They explore the phenomenon of triboluminescence and its correlation with isomeric changes, and discuss the nature of changes involved in the production of luminous flashes. The authors also consider the possibility of fluorescence being a "flash phenomenon" rather than a form of color, and the connection between phosphorescence and chemical changes.
