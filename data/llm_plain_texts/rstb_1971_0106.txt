tldr: The authors summarize recent findings on the afferent and efferent connections of the striatum and globus pallidus. They describe the striatum's connections with the cerebral cortex, intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus, and midbrain, as well as its efferent connections with the globus pallidus and substantia nigra. The study highlights the similarities between the structure and connections of the basal ganglia and the cerebellum, suggesting that further investigation may reveal more about their functions.
