tldr: This article investigates the stability of membrane potential and ion concentration in cells with a restricted extracellular space. The authors find that the presence of a restricted extracellular space can cause instability of the resting potential, even if the membrane slope conductance is positive. They also discover that concentration changes in the restricted space play an important role in the heart and other cells.
