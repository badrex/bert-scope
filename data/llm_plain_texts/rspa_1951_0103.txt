tldr: The authors discuss the limitations and refinements of molecular orbital theory when applied to conjugated hydrocarbons and heteropolar systems. They propose the self-consistent LCAO method to improve the accuracy of bond lengths and electronegativity predictions. The method is applied to various molecules, showing promising results, but remains challenging for large conjugated systems.
