tldr: The authors develop a statistical method to calculate nuclear energies and stability using the Hartree approximation. They consider four different types of nuclear forces and a linear combination of meson and exponential interaction potentials. The results are applied to calculate nuclear energies and radii, and the stability of nuclei is investigated. The study provides satisfactory agreement with experimental data for odd nuclei but indicates that the statistical model does not emphasize the difference between even and odd nuclei sufficiently.
