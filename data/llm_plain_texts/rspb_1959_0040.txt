tldr: The authors conducted a chemical and histological study on the pigments of the polychaete worm Chaetopterus variopedatus. They discovered that the green coloration in the gut is due to a pigment called 'chaetopterin,' which is a mixture of phaeophorbides a and b. Other pigments found in the gut include chlorophyll derivatives, carotenoids, and melanin. The study used chromatography techniques to separate and identify these pigments, providing insights into their roles in the worm's biology.
