tldr: This article presents a case study of a boy with hair that has alternating bands of brown and white. The white segments are found to be imperfect in structure and are linked to a weak constitution. The author also observes that the growth rate of the hair is much faster than normal. The cause of the alternation in hair structure remains unknown, but the author suggests that similar pathological processes may be responsible for "dead" and faded hair in other cases of illness or debilitated health.
