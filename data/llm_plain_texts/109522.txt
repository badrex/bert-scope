tldr: Richard Walker's experiments with muriate of lime, a neutral salt, produced artificial cold. He mixed the salt with snow and achieved a refrigeration that lowered the temperature to -55 degrees Celsius. Walker also experimented with different strengths of the salt and shared a method to obtain transparent ice for optical purposes.
