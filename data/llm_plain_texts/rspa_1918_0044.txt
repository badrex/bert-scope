tldr: The author investigates the Cesaro convergence of restricted Fourier series, showing that they share the convergence properties of Fourier series. The study focuses on the upper and lower functions of these series and their independence from the values of the associated function outside a small neighborhood of the considered point. This research contributes to the understanding of the behavior of series of functions and their convergence properties.
