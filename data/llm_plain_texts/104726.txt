tldr: 'The author, Michael Russel, shares his experience of being awakened by a violent percussion at his home. He describes the shaking and the unusual turning of two china figures on a cabinet. He also mentions two other people who experienced a similar blast and were nearly turned around by the shock. Russel suggests that these events might be worthy of the Royal Society's attention.'
