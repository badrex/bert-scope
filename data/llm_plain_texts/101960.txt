tldr: Francis Roberts presents an arithmetic paradox about the chances of two lotteries. Despite one lottery offering better odds (3:1) than the other (2:1), the gamester faces the same disadvantage in both. The author explains this through a mathematical analysis of the odds and values of the lots, demonstrating the importance of careful reasoning in arithmetic.
