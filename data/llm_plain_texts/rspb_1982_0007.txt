tldr: This study investigates the statistical properties of miniature endplate potentials (mEPPs) and how they change when exposed to 4-aminopyridine. The author demonstrates that series with a high proportion of giant mEPPs have different statistical structures than those with a low proportion. The effects of 4-aminopyridine on the distribution of mEPP amplitudes and the intervals between mEPPs are analyzed, revealing an increase in the relative magnitude of a specific population of mEPPs and changes in the time course of mEPPs.
