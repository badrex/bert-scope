tldr: The author examines lung growth in humans and other vertebrates, focusing on the relationship between structural complexity and tension in elastic fibers. They find that the structural complexity of lungs at term is the same across different species, and that lung growth is responsible for the physical forces acting on elastic fibers. The study also provides evidence that the range of growth is the same in humans and rabbits.
