tldr: This article discusses the role of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (Rubisco) in photosynthesis. The enzyme plays a crucial part in the carbon assimilation process, and its characteristics, such as amount, activation state, and regulation of catalysis, are analyzed. The authors explore how changes in Rubisco's activity can affect photosynthesis and how environmental factors, like light intensity and carbon dioxide concentration, can influence the enzyme's function. They also consider the potential impact of genetic manipulation of Rubisco on photosynthesis and plant adaptation.
