tldr: 'This article explores the concept of mutational order and its impact on evolutionary divergence between populations. It demonstrates that mutational order can be more important than random genetic drift in certain circumstances, such as large populations or strong selection. The study also highlights the role of epistasis in intensifying the effects of mutational order and genetic drift on divergence between populations.'
