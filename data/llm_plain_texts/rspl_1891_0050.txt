tldr: The author examines the effects of high temperatures on rock specimens, specifically quartz-felsite of St. John's Yale. They observe changes in the rock's structure, such as the development of vacuoles and the presence of brown glass. The study has implications for understanding natural processes and the behavior of rocks under extreme conditions.
