tldr: This article discusses the primary photoprocesses of chlorophyll and related molecules in photosynthesis. It explains how light absorption by photosynthetic pigments in plants is converted into chemical energy, which is represented by NADPH2 and ATP, and accompanied by the liberation of oxygen. The article also covers the physical processes that follow light absorption by a polyatomic molecule in solution, focusing on chlorophyll a, and the role of solvent molecules in affecting the photoprocesses.
