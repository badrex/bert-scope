tldr: The authors conducted an experimental test of the deterministic mutation hypothesis, which suggests that the elimination rate of deleterious mutations may be higher in a sexual population in mutation-selection equilibrium. They studied the effect of sex on offspring fitness in two strains of the unicellular alga Chlamydomonas moewusii. The results showed a significant negative effect of sex on fitness after crossing strains treated with ultraviolet radiation, supporting the deterministic mutation hypothesis.
