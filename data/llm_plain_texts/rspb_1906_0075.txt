tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the relationship between blood-vessels and liver cells. They injected carmine gelatine into the blood-vessels and found that the liver cells contain intracellular channels that communicate with the blood-vessels. This discovery challenges the generally accepted views on the relationship between blood-vessels and lymphatics in liver cells.
