tldr: This article explores the history of the Royal Society Club and its pre-history through the diaries of John Byrom. It discusses the club's origins, its members, and the connection between the club and the Royal Society. The diaries provide valuable insights into the social and scientific interactions of the time, but do not significantly extend the known history of the club before 1743.
