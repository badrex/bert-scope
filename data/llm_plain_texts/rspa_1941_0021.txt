tldr: This article discusses the thermal decomposition of fully deuterated diethyl ether and the specific heats of solids and liquids. The authors found that the kinetics of the thermal decomposition of fully deuterated diethyl ether are different from those of the non-deuterated version. They also studied the specific heats of various solid and liquid materials, providing insights into their thermal properties.
