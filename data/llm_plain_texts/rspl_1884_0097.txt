revised_title: Fibrin-yielding Constituents and Coagulation of Blood Plasma
semantic_tags:

tldr: The author investigates the fibrin-yielding constituents of blood plasma and their behavior in coagulation. They discover that the majority of coagulable matter in plasma is not directly coagulable with serum, but can be altered to clot with serum or ferment. The author also examines the effects of heating and salt solutions on plasma coagulation and discusses the presence of a special substance that aids in the conversion of the precursor of fibrinogen into fibrinogen.
