tldr: This article discusses the unique fossil biotas found in the Vendian period, focusing on three major groups of fossils: trace fossils of worm-like organisms, benthic coelenterates, and Vendozoa. The author proposes that these fossils represent a distinct evolutionary period with different ecological conditions, and suggests that further research into Precambrian palaeontology can help us better understand this time in Earth's history.
