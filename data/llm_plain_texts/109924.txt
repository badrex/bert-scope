tldr: This article discusses the anomalies in magnetic observations on ship-board and suggests that the iron used in the construction of the ship is the probable source of these anomalies. The author, Mr. Scoresby, presents a table of his selected observations conducted on the coast of Spitzbergen in 1815 and 1817, and deduces that the anomaly of attraction is greatest in men-of-war and ships containing large quantities of iron.
