tldr: The authors used neutron diffraction to study the structure of α-resorcinol, an aromatic molecule. They found that the hydrogen bonds linking neighboring molecules consist of "long bonds" with the proton closer to one oxygen atom than the other. The study provides a more accurate location of hydrogen atoms in the molecule compared to X-ray diffraction methods.
