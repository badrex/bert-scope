tldr: This study investigates the water-binding capacity and phase equilibria in protein systems, specifically egg albumin and muscle. The researchers found that the bound water in egg albumin at 20°C is approximately 0.35 grams per gram of solid, and the water content in both thick and thin egg white is nearly the same at different freezing temperatures. The findings have implications for understanding the properties of proteins and their interactions with water.
