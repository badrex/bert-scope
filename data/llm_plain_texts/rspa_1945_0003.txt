tldr: The author introduces a new concept of 'expansors' in the context of the Lorentz group, which are like tensors in space-time with an infinite number of components. The author demonstrates how these expansors can be used to create unitary representations of the Lorentz group, which have potential applications in quantum mechanics and tensor analysis.
