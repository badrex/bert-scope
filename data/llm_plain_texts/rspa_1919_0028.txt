tldr: The author presents a new apparatus for directly measuring accelerations caused by seismic phenomena, oscillations, and movements in structures. The apparatus uses a cast-iron platform and a heavy mass suspended by a rod, which applies pressure to a plate proportional to the acceleration. The pressure is measured using Luts-Edelmann's string electrometer, allowing for the determination of instantaneous acceleration values. This method provides a practical solution for measuring accelerations in seismological areas and other structures subjected to vibrations or sudden shocks.
