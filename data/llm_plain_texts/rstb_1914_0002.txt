tldr: The author examines the structure and anatomy of Onychaster, a rare brittle-star from the Carboniferous period. They describe the unique features of its vertebrae, such as the radial canal and the adambulacral plates, and discuss the implications for understanding the evolution of the Ophiuroidea group. The study provides valuable insights into the morphology and classification of ancient marine life.
