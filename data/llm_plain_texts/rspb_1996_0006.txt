tldr: This study examines the relationship between population density and selection on two genetic polymorphisms of coat color and horn type in a fluctuating population of Soay sheep in Scotland. The research shows that the effects of these polymorphisms on survival are independent, and the level of overcompensatory mortality, responsible for population instability, is higher after accounting for genetic variation in coat and horn traits. This emphasizes the importance of understanding the interaction between selection and population demography for both genetic and ecological studies of natural populations.
