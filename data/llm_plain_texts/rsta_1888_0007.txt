tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the changes in dimensions of iron rings and rods when magnetized. They discovered that the elongation of the iron decreases when the magnetizing force is increased beyond a certain limit. The author also developed a new method to create a uniform magnetic field using iron rings, which helped overcome some limitations of previous experiments.
