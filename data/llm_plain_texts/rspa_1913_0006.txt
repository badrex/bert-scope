tldr: The authors describe their experimental setup and methods for investigating the crystallographic properties of solidified hydrogen and oxygen. They discovered that hydrogen crystallizes in the regular system, forming needle-shaped crystals, while the solidification of oxygen is a more complex process involving a viscous liquid phase and slow crystal growth. The authors also observed a transformation of oxygen into a fine-grained crystal mass with strong double refraction.
