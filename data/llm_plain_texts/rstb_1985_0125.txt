tldr: This study investigates the distribution and activities of bacteria and zooplankton in the vicinity of a shallow-sea tidal mixing front in the western Irish Sea. The research focuses on the physical and chemical background, including temperature, salinity, and nutrient concentrations, to understand the impact of the front on the biological features and interactions between different trophic levels.
