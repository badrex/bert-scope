tldr: The authors analyze the potential energy of atoms and ions and its dependence on interatomic distance. They propose a new approach to understanding the repulsive force between ions in crystal lattices, which can be used to calculate the elastic constants and other properties of crystals. The study focuses on the relationship between the potential energy, density, compressibility, and the frequencies and amplitudes of infra-red vibrations in crystals.
