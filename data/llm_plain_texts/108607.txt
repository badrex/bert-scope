tldr: Edward Sabine examines the existence of the decennial inequality in solar-diurnal and lunar-diurnal magnetic variations using observations from the Hobarton Observatory. He finds that the solar-diurnal variations exhibit a decennial period, while the lunar-diurnal variations do not. This study is important for understanding the theoretical implications of magnetic variations.
