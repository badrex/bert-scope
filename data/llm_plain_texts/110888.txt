tldr: The author, William Addison, observed peculiar modifications of the force of cohesion while studying tubercles in the lungs and human secretions. He found that transparent liquid streams become visible when vapors or fluids mix, and opaque deposits resembling clouds form on these streams. This phenomenon helps explain various cloud, film, and membranous formations resulting from different cohesive forces acting on liquid or gaseous bodies.
