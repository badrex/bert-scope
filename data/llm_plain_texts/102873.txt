tldr: The author discusses the influence of respiration on the heart's motion, specifically the role of intercostal muscles and the diaphragm in aiding the heart's contraction. They argue that the expansion and contraction of the lungs during respiration facilitate the heart's systole and diastole by allowing blood to pass through the lungs and preventing opposing forces within the heart.
