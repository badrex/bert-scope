tldr: This article explores the electrodynamic self-energy of the electron using quantum field theory. The authors consider the wave equation for a stationary electron at rest and in interaction with only its own electromagnetic field. They derive expressions for the wave motion and the self-energy of the electron using a method that avoids the limitations of perturbation theory. The study provides insights into the convergence of the self-energy for large values of the electron's charge and the limitations of previous calculations based on perturbation theory.
