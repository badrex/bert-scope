tldr: Researchers discovered a new species of fossil plants, belonging to the Characeae family, in the Purbeck beds. The plants have a unique structure with club-like nodes, utricles enclosing oogonia, and clusters of clavate processes called rosettes. The researchers also found four other types of fruits and their corresponding vegetative parts, providing a wealth of material for further study.
