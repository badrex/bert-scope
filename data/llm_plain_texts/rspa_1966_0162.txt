tldr: This article presents experimental and theoretical work on the hyperfine structure and nuclear moments of samarium isotopes. The authors used the atomic beam method to measure the frequencies of various transitions in the levels of the odd isotopes of samarium. They also conducted high-field measurements using the triple resonance method to evaluate the nuclear magnetic dipole moments. The results provide a precise determination of the nuclear magnetic moment of one isotope and a ratio of the dipole interaction constants for both isotopes. The study also discusses the breakdown of coupling and second-order corrections in the hyperfine structure and the application of these corrections to evaluate the nuclear moments and parameters for samarium.
