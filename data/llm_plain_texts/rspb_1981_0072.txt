tldr: This study investigates the effects of monocular deprivation, reverse suturing, and reopening of the deprived eye on the physiological organization of the primary visual cortex in monkeys. The results show that reverse suturing promotes the'recapture' of the cortex by the initially deprived eye, while reopening the eye alone does not cause significant changes. The recovery process depends on the establishment of a competitive advantage through the right eye being made more active than the left.
