tldr: The authors conducted site-directed mutagenesis experiments on the lipoate acyltransferase of Escherichia coli to study its catalytic mechanism. They found that a specific serine residue, Ser550, is essential for the enzyme's function, supporting the proposed similarity between lipoate acyltransferases and chloramphenicol acetyltransferases in their catalytic mechanisms. This research provides insights into the structure and function of lipoate acyltransferases and their role in 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complexes.
