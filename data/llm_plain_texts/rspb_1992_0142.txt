tldr: This study examines the relationship between sexual dimorphism in size and color and adult mortality rates in 28 North American passerine bird species. The research finds that sex-biased mortality is positively correlated with sexual size dimorphism and male plumage brightness. The findings suggest that the evolution of sexual dimorphism in birds is influenced by the opposing forces of sexual selection and adult mortality rates, which may explain differences in the expression of ornamental traits across species.
