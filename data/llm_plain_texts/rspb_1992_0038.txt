tldr: Researchers examined the morphology of neurons in layer 1 of the cat visual cortex by injecting them with lucifer yellow in lightly fixed brain slices. They discovered various types of neurons, including smooth, sparsely spiny, and spiny neurons resembling pyramidal cells. The density of neurons in layer 1 is sufficient to sample the entire representation of the visual field in area 17, providing new insights into the neuronal composition of the adult cat visual cortex.
