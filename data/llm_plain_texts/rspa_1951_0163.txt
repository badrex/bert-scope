tldr: The authors re-investigated the infra-red absorption of nitrous oxide gas near 4-5 cm^-1 using high resolving power. They found two vibrational transitions and analyzed them theoretically, obtaining rotational constants. The results emphasize the importance of using precise wavelength standards for infra-red measurements to achieve accuracy comparable to microwave measurements. The study provides information about vibrational and rotational interactions in nitrous oxide and helps determine molecular moments of inertia in different vibrational levels.
