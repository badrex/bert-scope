tldr: This article is a biographical memoir of Donald Devereux Woods, a renowned biochemist and microbiologist who made significant contributions to the field of bacterial chemistry. Woods studied under Marjory Stephenson at Cambridge, where he investigated the breakdown of amino acids by bacteria and the use of the Warburg manometer in enzyme systems. He later worked with Sir Paul Fildes in London, focusing on bacterial growth factors and the potential of antibacterial agents. Woods was a key figure in the Medical Research Council's Unit for Bacterial Chemistry and made important discoveries in bacterial metabolism and enzymology.
