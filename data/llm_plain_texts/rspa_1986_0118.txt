tldr: The authors propose a new spectroscopic technique called Zeeman modulated radiometer for the remote detection and measurement of nitric oxide in the atmosphere. The technique uses a magnetic field to modulate radiation emitted or absorbed by the gas, providing high sensitivity and selectivity in detecting nitric oxide. The performance of the laboratory instrument is compared with theoretical predictions, showing its potential for observing nitric oxide in the atmosphere.
