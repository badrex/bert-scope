tldr: The authors discovered that the electrophoretic mobility of human blood platelets increases when they undergo a shape change induced by ADP. This increase in mobility is associated with an increase in sialic acids on the platelet surface, which determines their electrophoretic mobility. The findings suggest that the rapid shape change of platelets is linked to an increase in the net negative charge excess of the mobility-determining surface of the cells.
