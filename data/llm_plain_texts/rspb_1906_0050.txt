tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of electrical discharges of high potential and rapid frequency on bacteria. They found that these discharges could rapidly destroy bacteria and cause a significant change in the fluid's pH due to the formation of nitrous and nitric acids. This research contributed to the understanding of the potential use of electrical discharges in disinfection and sterilization processes.
