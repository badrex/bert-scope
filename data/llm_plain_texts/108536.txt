tldr: The author, W.R. Grove, investigates the electrochemical polarity of gases and the differences in electrolytic discharges at positive and negative terminals. He conducts experiments with nitric acid batteries and various gases, observing oxidation and the formation of different colored stains on silver plates. Grove's findings suggest a new mode of electricity transmission that combines electrolytic and disruptive discharges.
