tldr: This article evaluates the fifth virial coefficients for Lennard-Jones molecules in two dimensions by directly calculating the relevant cluster integrals. The results are compared with recent approximate calculations, and some applications are discussed. The study provides a comprehensive understanding of the two-dimensional Lennard-Jones system, which is useful for discussing physisorbed systems and understanding phase transitions.
