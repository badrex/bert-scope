tldr: The article presents a study on the scattering properties of particle assemblies, specifically spheres, using the Rayleigh approximation. A system of linear simultaneous equations is derived to calculate the scattering properties of the assemblies, and numerical calculations are performed to illustrate the properties of the scattered light. The results are compared with previous work, and a diagnostic technique is proposed to determine the size, complex refractive index, and number of particles in a long chain agglomerate.
