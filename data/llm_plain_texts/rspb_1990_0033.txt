tldr: The authors analyzed the light-harvesting peridinin-chlorophyll a-proteins (PCP) in various dinoflagellate species using immunoblotting techniques and affinity-purified antibodies. They found that the antibodies cross-reacted with PCP from all dinoflagellates tested, and the PCP apoprotein occurred as monomeric or dimeric molecules of different sizes in different algae. This study helps to understand the immunological characteristics of pigment-protein complexes in dinoflagellates and their evolution.
