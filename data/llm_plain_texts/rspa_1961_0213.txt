tldr: The authors describe a method for calculating the zeros of Hecke zeta functions in the Gaussian field. They used the Mercury computer at Manchester University to compute the functions and their zeros, finding that they satisfy the extended Riemann hypothesis. The results provide valuable insights into the distribution of complex zeros and the behavior of these functions.
