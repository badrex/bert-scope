tldr: The authors developed a new method for measuring the relative illuminating intensities of different parts of the spectrum, which can be used to compare the visual intensity of one ray with another of different color. They used this method to create a "luminosity curve" that shows the intensity of different parts of the spectrum, which can be useful in practical photometry.
