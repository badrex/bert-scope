tldr: The author explores the partial differential equation of curvature and orthogonal surfaces, establishing a connection between the parameter of a family of surfaces and the conditions required for them to form an orthogonal system. The study focuses on the mathematical transformations and the metrical theory of curvature, providing insights into the relationships between surfaces, tangents, and normal lines.
