tldr: This paper examines the magnetic properties of armour-plated ships and their impact on compass readings. The authors discuss the effects of iron and steel used in ship construction, such as the deviation of compass readings and the heeling error. They also explore the importance of the position of iron in a ship and the changes in magnetic properties over time. The paper provides practical recommendations for ship construction to minimize the impact of these magnetic effects on compass readings.
