tldr: This study investigates the accumulation of noradrenaline in constricted sympathetic nerves using fluorescence and electron microscopy. The results show a close correlation between the accumulation of fluorescent material, attributable to noradrenaline, and the presence of granular vesicles in the nerves. The accumulation of noradrenaline increases rapidly after constriction and reaches a maximum after approximately 2 days. Reserpine reduces the accumulation, suggesting that the constriction blocks the normal transport of noradrenaline in sympathetic axons.
