tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the production of pressure marks on dodecahedral and cubic faces of diamonds using a diamond ball. They observed that the cracks were specifically oriented according to crystallographic expectations of easy cleavage directions. The surface distortions that accompanied the cracks were studied using multiple-beam interference methods, revealing permanent distortions and providing evidence for the existence of plastic flow in diamonds at room temperature.
