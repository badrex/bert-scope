tldr: The authors describe the synthesis and properties of an electron-ion plasma in a steady state, created by injecting opposing beams of charges into a field-free region. They study the electric neutrality, electric test fields, and interactions between the moving charges in the plasma. The results show resonance absorption in an electron-ion plasma and demonstrate the effect of a magnetic field on the plasma's transmission and absorption.
