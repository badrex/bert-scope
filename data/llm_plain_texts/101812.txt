tldr: The author, Monsieur de Gennes, presents a new loom design that can weave linen cloth without the help of an artificer. The innovative machine uses a serpent-shaped handle, a shuttle, and a series of arms to automate the weaving process. This design allows for broader cloth production, fewer knots, and faster work with less cost, as it only requires one boy to operate multiple looms.
