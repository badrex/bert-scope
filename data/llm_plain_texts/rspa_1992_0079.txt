  - Copper material model
  - Constitutive equations
tldr: The authors developed a viscoplastic damage model for copper, which can predict deformation history and lifetime under complex mechanical and cyclic thermal loading conditions. They created constitutive equations for creep and cyclic plasticity damage, and a creep-cyclic plasticity interaction law. The model was validated through various experimental tests, showing good agreement with the results. This model can be used in engineering design for materials subject to cyclic plasticity and creep at elevated temperatures.
