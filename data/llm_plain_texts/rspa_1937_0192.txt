tldr: The authors investigated the infra-red absorption spectra of hydroxy compounds, focusing on the effect of molecular structure on the absorption bands. They found that the intensity of the bands is influenced by the concentration and structure of the molecules, and that the association band diminishes on dilution in a non-polar solvent or by raising the temperature. The study provides insights into the behavior of hydroxy compounds and their applications in various solvents.
