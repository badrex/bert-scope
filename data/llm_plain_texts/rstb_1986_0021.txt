tldr: This article discusses the growth and form of modular organisms, which grow by the repeated iteration of multicellular parts called modules. It explores the differences between modular and unitary organisms, the various forms and structures of modular organisms, and how their growth patterns affect their interactions with their environment and other organisms. The article also touches upon the potential for somatic mutation in modular organisms and the implications for evolutionary processes.
