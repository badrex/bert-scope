tldr: The study investigates the stress relaxation process from doubly-periodic arrays of slit-like cracks in an infinite elastic solid under plane and anti-plane strain conditions. The research uses a numerical method to solve the singular integral equations and presents results for the extent of plasticity spread and crack-tip opening displacement. The findings show that the presence of multiple cracks can have a beneficial or adverse effect on the fracture characteristics of solids, depending on the far-field state of stress.
