tldr: This article explores the relationship between the coefficient of the Thomson effect and certain physical properties of metals, such as specific heat, specific electrical resistance, and coefficient of expansion. The author found a close connection between these properties and the coefficient of the Thomson effect, which could help in understanding the behavior of metals under different conditions.
