tldr: This article discusses the structural analysis of coal extracts, focusing on the methods used to study their chemical and physical properties. Techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (n.m.r.) spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and chromatography are employed to analyze coal extracts and distillates. The authors present average structures to represent these complex materials and describe the processes occurring during coal liquefaction.
