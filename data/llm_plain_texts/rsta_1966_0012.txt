tldr: The authors conducted a study on heat flow measurements in the northwest Indian Ocean and the Red Sea. They found a high heat flow value in the Gulf of Aden, suggesting a region of unusually high temperature below the ocean floor. The study also showed a constant heat flow across the continental margin between the African coast and the Seychelles. The authors analyzed the effects of fluctuations in bottom-water temperature on the geothermal gradient and concluded that these fluctuations do not invalidate the heat flow measurements.
