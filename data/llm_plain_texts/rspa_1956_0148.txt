tldr: This study investigates the competitive removal of hydrogen atoms by ethylene and propylene in atomic hydrogen interactions with olefines. The authors developed a new method to analyze the gaseous components of the system using mass spectrometry, allowing them to determine the rate of olefine concentration fall and check for unexpected products. The study provides insights into the collision efficiencies and radical reactions involved in these processes.
