tldr: The authors analyze the mechanism of oxidation-reduction potential and demonstrate that Wieland's hydrogen transfer theory can explain reduction-potential phenomena, contrary to the claims made by Clark. They show that both theories lead to the same results, and Clark's objections to Wieland's theory are unfounded.
