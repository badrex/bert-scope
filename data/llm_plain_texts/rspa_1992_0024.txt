tldr: The authors calculate the vacuum field fluctuations and spontaneous emission rates in dielectric slabs, providing a quantum theory for these phenomena. They identify and analyze the spatial modes of the system, including traveling and trapped modes, and evaluate the electric field fluctuations in the vacuum state. This research has implications for understanding and controlling spontaneous emission rates in practical devices, such as semiconductors.
