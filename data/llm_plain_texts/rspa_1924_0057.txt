tldr: The authors investigate the destruction of rennin by agitation and find that it is due to a chemical surface reaction at the air-liquid interface. They propose that the reaction involves rennin and a reactant similar to a fatty acid. The study provides insights into the role of surface chemistry in the degradation of enzymes and the potential applications of this knowledge in various fields.
