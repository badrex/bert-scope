tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the interchange of pulmonary gases during human respiration. They found that nitrogen takes no appreciable part in the respiratory process, and the method of determining the volume of air inspired can be trusted as correct. This research contributes to the understanding of gas exchange in the human body.
