revised_title: 'Investigation of Heat Conduction Through Gases and the Effect of Accommodation'
semantic_tags:
  - Heat conduction
  - Gas properties
  - Thermal conductivity
  - Accommodation coefficient
  - Temperature discontinuity
tldr: 'This article investigates the effect of accommodation on heat conduction through gases. The authors develop a modified Fourier equation to account for temperature discontinuity and accommodation, which can be used to determine the thermal conductivity of gases. They also describe their experimental setup and methodology for measuring heat conduction through gases, which allows them to eliminate important errors in the determination of thermal conductivity.'
