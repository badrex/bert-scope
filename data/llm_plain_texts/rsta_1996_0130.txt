tldr: This article reviews the understanding of the structural phase transition of strontium titanate, focusing on the role of elastic interactions and the discrepancies between experimental results and classical scaling theory. The author discusses the development of Landau's phenomenological theory and the influence of critical fluctuations on phase transitions, emphasizing the need for further theoretical and experimental work to clarify the results.
