tldr: The author investigates the effects of glucosone, an oxidation product of glucose, on normal mice. They find that glucosone is utilized by diabetics and has potential significance in carbohydrate metabolism. The study suggests that glucosone may play a role in the transformation of glucose in the animal body, and further research is needed to understand its full implications.
