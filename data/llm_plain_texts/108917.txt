tldr: This article discusses the completion of the Magnetic Survey of the South Polar Regions by the Erebus and Terror ships during the epoch of 1840-1845. The expedition aimed to study the Earth's magnetic force and its variations at different points on the surface. The ships sailed from the Thames, passing through the Cape of Good Hope, Kerguelen Island, and Tasmania, before reaching the Antarctic region. The team observed the Magnetic Declination, Dip, and Force, and collected data that would help in constructing a rigorous theory of terrestrial magnetism. The findings were communicated to the Royal Society and formed the basis for further studies in the field.
