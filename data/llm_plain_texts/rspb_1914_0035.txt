tldr: The authors studied the genetics of tetraploid plants in Primula sinensis and discovered that these plants have a double set of factors compared to diploid plants. They found that tetraploid plants produce peculiar intermediate forms and that some recessive traits can throw the dominant traits. This research provides insights into the factorial constitution of tetraploid plants and the processes of segregation in them.
