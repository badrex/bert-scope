tldr: Researchers studied the energy expenditure and foraging behavior of free-ranging black-browed albatrosses using heart rate data loggers, salt water switches, and satellite transmitters. They found that the birds' energy expenditure during incubation and brooding was lower than during the chick-rearing phase, with foraging levels maintained almost continuously. The study provides valuable insights into the energy costs of flight and the birds' behavior while on the water or at sea.
