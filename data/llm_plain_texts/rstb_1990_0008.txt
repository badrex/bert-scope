tldr: The article discusses the process of demethylation in animal cells, specifically focusing on tissue-specific gene demethylation. The authors demonstrate that B lymphocytes can recognize and demethylate the Ig K gene, while other cell types cannot. They also analyze the rat insulin gene and show that it undergoes tissue-specific demethylation in beta-islet cells. These findings suggest that demethylation is a crucial process in gene regulation and development.
