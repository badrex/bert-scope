tldr: 'Stephen Gray invented a double microscope with a micrometer to measure the height of mercury in a barometer more accurately. The instrument allows for precise readings down to the thousandth part of an inch. Gray also suggests a similar improvement for thermometers, requiring a longer microscope and a longer tube to avoid the influence of the thermometer's warm effluvia on the observer's judgment.'
