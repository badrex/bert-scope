tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the behavior of argon and helium when exposed to electric discharge. They discovered that the length of the spark in helium is significantly greater than in other gases, and they observed a ribbon-like discharge in various gases at specific pressures. The authors also discussed the purity of the gas samples and the possible reasons for the unique behavior of helium.
