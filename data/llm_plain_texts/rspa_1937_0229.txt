tldr: This article discusses the viscosity of liquids and how it is affected by temperature, particle properties, and the presence of solutes. The authors explore the behavior of fluids with anomalous viscosity, such as those containing colloids, and the role of temperature in increasing or decreasing viscosity. They also touch upon the connection between viscosity and other thermodynamic properties, emphasizing the need for collaboration between theoretical physicists and experimentalists in the study of liquids.
