tldr: 'J. Clerk Maxwell conducted experiments to study color vision in color-blind observers. He used a prism instrument to analyze the spectrum and found that color-blind individuals see colors differently than those with normal vision. Maxwell's findings supported the theory of dichromic vision, where two color elements are responsible for color perception. He also determined the relationship between the defective color element in color-blind vision and the three primary colors in normal vision.'
