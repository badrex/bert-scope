tldr: The authors argue that simple neural network models used to explain animal signaling evolution may be misleading due to their simplistic nature and inability to capture essential properties of real biological recognition systems. They challenge the claims of these models in explaining the evolution of exaggerated and symmetrical signals and suggest that more sophisticated models should be used to better understand perception and signal evolution.
