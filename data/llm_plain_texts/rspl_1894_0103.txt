tldr: The authors describe a new instrument for measuring the phase difference between electrical voltage and current in alternating current systems. The device uses a rotating cylinder with a metal wire embedded in its surface, connected to a dial and an index. By adjusting the brushes that make contact with the wire, the instrument can accurately determine the phase difference, providing valuable information for electrical engineering applications.
