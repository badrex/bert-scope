tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the decay of molecular beams of sodium and potassium in a mercury vapor stream. They measured the decay of the beams' intensity as a function of the angular aperture of the beam system, and their findings support the collision theory of Massey and Mohr. This research provides a method to determine decay constants (or mean free paths) independent of the apparatus geometry and contributes to a better understanding of chemical reaction processes.
