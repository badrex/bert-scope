tldr: The authors discuss the biology and adaptations of the Nothofagus genus in the southern cold temperature zones. They explore the species' preferences for warmer or colder conditions, their center of origin, and the impact of climate change and human activities on their habitats. The authors also mention the presence of unique fungal genera associated with Nothofagus, supporting the idea that the genus originated in the southern temperate zone.
