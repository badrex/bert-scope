tldr: This article discusses the threshold behaviour of electron excitation and polarization functions in helium. The authors describe their experimental setup and data-logging system, which enables long integration times to be combined with rapid coverage of a suitable range of electron energy. The results show that the polarization falls rapidly above the threshold, and light from the 2p to 1s transitions is unpolarized at all energies.
