tldr: The author investigates the neurovenous tissues in cephalopods, which are irregular strands of cells and nerve fibers connecting the nervous system with the venous system. These tissues are found in various cephalopods, including octopods, Sepia, and Loligo. The author suggests that these tissues may be involved in regulating the quantity and composition of body fluids through some modification of nervous activities. The granules within these tissues indicate neurosecretion, but they may also function through ionic pumps.
