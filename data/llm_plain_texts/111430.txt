tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the duration of vital properties in motor and sensitive nerves compared to muscles when deprived of blood. The results showed that the essential vital properties of sensitive and motor nerves can last longer than muscular irritability after a complete or almost complete deprivation of blood. This discovery challenges the previously accepted doctrine that the vital properties of motor and sensitive nerves disappear much sooner than those of muscles after death or when they are deprived of blood.
