tldr: The authors studied the development of three kiwi embryos, providing new insights into their anatomy, particularly the skull, shoulder-girdle, and limbs. They discovered a ligamentous pro-coracoid in A. australis and an intermedium in the carpus. The study also highlights the development of the kiwi's brain, with the cerebellum fully developed and the optic lobes at their maximum size.
