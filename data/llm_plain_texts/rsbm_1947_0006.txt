tldr: 'Charles Spearman was a pioneering psychologist who made significant contributions to the field of experimental psychology. He developed the theory of two factors, which states that every test has one common factor (general intelligence) and one specific factor. Spearman's work laid the foundation for modern psychological testing and the use of statistical methods in understanding human abilities and intelligence.'
