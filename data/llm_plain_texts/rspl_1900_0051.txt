tldr: The author discovered the specific micro-organism responsible for distemper in dogs and developed a vaccine to prevent the deadly disease. The vaccine works similarly to those created for plague and enteric fever, offering protection to dogs and potentially other animals as well. Further research is needed to determine the exact duration of protection provided by the vaccine.
