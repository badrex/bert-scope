tldr: This review lecture discusses recent advancements in understanding the internal structures and dynamics of the Earth, the Moon, and planets. It highlights the knowledge gained from seismology, the behavior of materials at high pressures, and the study of planetary orbits. The lecture emphasizes the importance of Bullen's hypothesis in constructing models of planetary interiors and the need to consider factors such as temperature and composition in understanding the Earth's interior.
