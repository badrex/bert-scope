tldr: The authors studied the EPR spectrum of vibrationally excited hydroxyl radicals in gas phase. They observed the spectrum in levels 2, 3, and 4 of the ground state, generated through the reaction between hydrogen atoms and ozone. The results provide information on the dependence of electronic structure and angular momentum coupling on internuclear distance, which can help identify the emission mechanism in radio astronomy.
