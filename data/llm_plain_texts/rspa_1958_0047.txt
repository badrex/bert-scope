tldr: The authors present a rigorous derivation of dispersion relations for inelastic meson scattering, following the method of Bogolyubov, Medvedev, and Polivanov. They focus on the case of two outgoing mesons and discuss the causality condition, radiation operators, and kinematical description of the process. The dispersion relations are derived for negative values of a parameter related to the square of the meson mass and are then analytically continued to real positive values.
