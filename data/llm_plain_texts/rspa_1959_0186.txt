tldr: The authors develop a method to calculate the binding energies of atomic nuclei using a self-consistent approach and the definition of the t-matrix. They extend the Brueckner theory to finite nuclei, considering self-consistency and tensor forces. The method uses an independent particle model with a harmonic oscillator potential and allows for state-dependent potentials to improve accuracy.
