tldr: This article explores the possibility of insects using pressure cycles to control water transfer between their body fluids and the environment. The tracheal system of terrestrial insects is proposed as a site for this mechanism, which could help maintain water balance in insects living in various environments. The author suggests that pressure changes can affect evaporation and condensation rates, allowing insects to regulate their water economy.
