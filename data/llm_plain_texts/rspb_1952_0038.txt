tldr: This study investigates the early changes in degenerating mammalian nerves, focusing on the physical properties of myelin and axoplasm, the course of the earliest structural changes in nerve fibers, and the properties of flow within the axons of mammalian nerves. The researchers observed that when a peripheral nerve is crushed, myelin and axoplasm behave like liquids and can be displaced along the nerve. They also found that the ends of nerve fibers proximal to the crushed point become larger than those at the distal ends within 24 to 48 hours after the crush.
