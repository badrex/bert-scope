tldr: The author investigates the development of striated muscular fibers in various organisms, including tadpoles, chicks, sheep, and humans. They observe that the process begins with oval cells that elongate and multiply their nuclei, eventually leading to the formation of striated fibers. The author also discusses the role of the sarcolemma and the similarities between their findings and other researchers' theories.
