tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the energy and angular distributions of charged particles from disintegrations caused by cosmic rays in silver and bromine nuclei. They used photographic emulsions to measure the energy and track the particles, finding that the energy distribution of protons can be explained by simple evaporation theory. The observations also revealed a high-energy tail consisting of direct knock-on protons and slow mesons. The authors discuss the implications of their findings and the methods used in their research.
