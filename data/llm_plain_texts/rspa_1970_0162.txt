tldr: This article discusses the differences between whiskers and filaments in terms of their properties and technological applications in fiber-reinforced materials. Whiskers, despite their high mechanical strength, have several technological drawbacks, such as their shortness, large scatter of strength, and high price. Filaments, on the other hand, have more advantageous properties, such as their continuous production, relatively low price, and good processing qualities. The article also explores the development of processes for producing microwires using the Taylor method, which have advantages over whiskers in terms of their constant diameter, smooth surface, and ability to be produced in long lengths.
