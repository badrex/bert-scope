tldr: The author compares the Momentum Transport and Vorticity Transport theories to explain the distribution of velocity in pipe flow and between parallel planes. The study finds that the Vorticity Transport theory is in better agreement with observations for pipe flow, while both theories show similar results for flow between parallel planes.
