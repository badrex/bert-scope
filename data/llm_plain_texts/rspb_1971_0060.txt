revised_title: 'Ultrastructural Integrity of Isolated Heterocysts in Blue-Green Algae'
semantic_tags:
  - Blue-green algae
  - Heterocysts
  - Ultrastructure
  - Isolation techniques
  - Nitrogen fixation
tldr: The authors investigate the ultrastructure of heterocysts in blue-green algae after isolation using various techniques. They find that the lysozyme method yields intact heterocysts, suggesting that previous studies using other methods may require re-examination. The study is important for understanding the physiological and biochemical aspects of heterocysts and their role in nitrogen fixation.
