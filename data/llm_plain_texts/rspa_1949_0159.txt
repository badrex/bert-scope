tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the change of electrical resistivity in superconductors when transitioning between the superconductive and normal state in a longitudinal magnetic field. They found that the resistance transition is continuous, contrary to the accepted belief of a discontinuous transition. The results also showed a relationship between the geometrical form of the conductor and hysteresis phenomena.
