tldr: The author conducted a series of experiments to determine the atomic weight of aluminium more accurately. They used different methods and processes to obtain precise results and minimize errors. The general mean of all the experiments resulted in an atomic weight of aluminium of 27.032, with a probable error of +0.045. This research adds aluminium to the limited list of elements with atomic weights determined with high precision.
