tldr: This article investigates the transition to Taylor vortices in a closed rapidly rotating cylindrical annulus. The effects of end walls on the flow are considered, and the linearized solution is derived. The study shows that for certain parameter ranges, nonlinearities are confined to the Ekman layers, allowing for a smooth transition to a Taylor vortex regime. The critical value for the onset of this transition is determined.
