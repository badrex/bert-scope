tldr: This article explores the dynamics of double convection, focusing on the competition between stabilizing and destabilizing mechanisms in fluid mechanics. The study examines the behavior of double-diffusive convection, including oscillatory convection, bifurcation structures, and the transition to temporal and spatiotemporal chaos. The research provides insights into the underlying physics and mathematical constraints of the problem, using numerical experiments and low-order model systems.
