tldr: The authors studied the crystal structures of the 1:1 pyrene-pyromellitic dianhydride molecular compound at 110 and 300 Kelvin using X-ray diffraction methods. They found that the component molecules are arranged in alternating arrays in mixed stacks, with an order-disorder transformation occurring near 300 Kelvin. The transformation results in positional disorder of the molecules, which may explain the widespread reports of high degrees of thermal vibration in crystals of molecular compounds.
