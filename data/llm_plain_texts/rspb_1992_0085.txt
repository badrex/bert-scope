tldr: Researchers discovered a slow voltage-activated potassium current in rat vagal neurons, specifically in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus. This current is different from the fast transient current called A-current and is not blocked by 4-aminopyridine, catechol, or tetraethylammonium. The slow current is associated with an increase in membrane conductance and has a reversal potential close to the potassium equilibrium potential.
