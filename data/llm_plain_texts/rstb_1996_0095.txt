tldr: This article examines the energy flow and life processes of individual cephalopods, focusing on their energy budgets, growth rates, and the costs of maintenance and reproduction. It discusses the challenges of studying cephalopods in the wild and the importance of understanding their energy allocation to various physiological processes, such as respiration, growth, and locomotion. The article also highlights the differences in energy efficiency between octopods and squids and the unique case of Nautilus, which has a slower growth rate and longer lifespan compared to other cephalopods.
