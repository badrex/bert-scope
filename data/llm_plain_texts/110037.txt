tldr: Sir Humphry Davy discovered a new phenomenon of electro-magnetism when he experimented with mercury connected in an electric circuit. He observed waves flowing off in all directions from the surface of the mercury, which were affected by the presence of a magnet. This phenomenon could not be attributed to electric repulsion or temperature changes, suggesting the existence of forces producing motions in right lines or undulations from the surfaces of the wires as a center. This finding challenged the idea of electro-magnetic results being produced by the motion of a single imponderable fluid.
