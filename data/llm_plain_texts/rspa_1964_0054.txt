tldr: The authors conducted experiments on spark discharges in various gases, measuring the formative time lags and overvoltage. They discovered a transition from Townsend to streamer discharges in air and oxygen, but not in hydrogen, nitrogen, or pure argon. The study provides insights into the mechanisms of spark discharges and their applications in various fields.
