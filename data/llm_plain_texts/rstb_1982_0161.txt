tldr: This article discusses the topological and regulatory aspects of dolichyl phosphate-mediated glycosylation of proteins. It explains how the synthesis of oligosaccharide chains of glycoproteins occurs within the intracellular membrane system and how dolichyl phosphate plays a role in regulating this process. The article also provides evidence for the asymmetric synthesis of chitobiosyl phosphate at the luminal face of the rough endoplasmic reticulum.
