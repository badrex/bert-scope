tldr: 'This study investigates the impact of electric light on the sexual cycles of ferrets. By altering the daily light ration, researchers were able to modify sexual activity in both male and female ferrets. This discovery suggests that light plays a significant role in conditioning sexual cycles in mammals, similar to its effects on birds.'
