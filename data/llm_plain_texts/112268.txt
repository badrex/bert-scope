tldr: The author investigates the immunity of the stomach from being digested by its own secretion during life. They propose that the stomach's resistance to digestion is due to the acidity of its contents being neutralized by the alkaline blood circulating through its walls. Experiments show that when the stomach's circulation is stopped and an acid is introduced, the stomach is susceptible to digestion. This research provides insight into the complex relationship between acidity and alkalinity in the digestive process.
