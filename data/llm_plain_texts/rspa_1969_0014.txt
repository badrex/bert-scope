tldr: This article explores the behavior of long waves on oceanic ridges, using a uniform rectangular ridge as a model. It demonstrates that an infinite number of modes of propagation along the ridge are possible and provides actual dispersion curves for numerical examples based on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The effect of the Earth's rotation is considered, and it is shown that it is very small in the numerical examples presented.
