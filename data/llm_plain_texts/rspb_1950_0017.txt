tldr: This article discusses the X-ray studies of muscle fibers and the underlying mechanisms of muscular contraction and relaxation. The author explores the role of myosin and actin in muscle fibers and their complex structure. X-ray diffraction patterns reveal the folding and unfolding of polypeptide chains in muscle fibers, which is crucial for understanding muscle contraction and relaxation. The author also highlights the importance of actomyosin, the complex formed by myosin and actin, in the structure and function of muscle fibers.
