tldr: This study investigates the relationship between body temperature and the surrounding air in terrestrial annelids and molluscs, specifically focusing on oligochaetes and pulmonates. The research finds that snails can maintain a body temperature well below the surrounding air when fully extended, while earthworms have a relatively low upper thermal death-point, making them unsuitable for long-term survival in direct sunlight. The findings suggest that terrestrial annelids and molluscs have unique ways of adapting to land environments, with snails being more resistant to heat than native frogs.
