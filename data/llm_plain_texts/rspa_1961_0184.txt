tldr: The authors conducted experiments on potassium and its alloys to study the thermoelectric properties and electron and phonon scattering. They found that the thermoelectric power is influenced by the specific nature of the scattering process and the electronic structure of the metal. The results showed that phonon drag, the direct momentum transfer from excited lattice waves to conduction electrons, still plays a significant role even at low temperatures. The authors also discovered that the addition of impurities can partially dampen the phonon-drag effect.
