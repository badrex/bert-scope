tldr: This study investigates the effects of insulin on the metabolism of glucose in the brain. It shows that insulin causes the brain cells to use more glucose, not only for glycogen formation but also for synthesizing other substances, likely non-essential amino acids. Insulin helps maintain a sustained increase in cerebral glucose gain during periods of hyperglycaemia, and it does not act by blocking the efflux of glucose from the brain or by indirectly stimulating glucose metabolism through reducing ketone body supply to the brain.
