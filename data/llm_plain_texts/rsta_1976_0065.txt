tldr: This article presents a strong interaction theory for the coaxial settling of three or more spheres at low Reynolds numbers. The authors focus on unsteady forces, particularly the Basset force, which is the most important force in gravitational flows. They provide experimental and theoretical results for the axial settling of three identical spheres, confirming the presence of the Basset force effect. The study shows that the Basset force is crucial for understanding multiparticle gravitational motions at low but non-zero Reynolds numbers.
