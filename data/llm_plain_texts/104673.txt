tldr: The author, John Starr, describes the Morbus Strangulatorius, a contagious and deadly disease that affects the respiratory system. He discusses various symptoms, such as gangrenous sloughs, petechiae, and strangulating respiration, and provides a detailed case study of a young girl who died suddenly from the disease. Starr also examines the role of putrid dispositions of juices and lodgments in the throat in the progression of the disease and suggests that early diagnosis and treatment may help in managing the disorder.
