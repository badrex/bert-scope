tldr: The authors studied the crystal structures of two polyiodide salts, phenacetin and theobromine. They found that both structures consist of alternating organic cations and anionic polyiodide layers. The crystal structure of phenacetin features the shortest distance between oxygen atoms, which is too short for a van der Waals contact but suitable for a symmetrical hydrogen bond. The crystal structure of theobromine is based on linear polyiodide ions. The authors discuss the differences in the structures and the possible explanations for these differences, such as the lengths of secondary bonds between the organic cations and iodide ions.
