tldr: The authors conducted an X-ray investigation of normal paraffins to study their crystal structures and thermal expansion near their melting points. They found that the length of the chain axis depends less on temperature than the length of the other two axes. The crystal structure changes into hexagonal close packing as the temperature approaches the melting point. The study provides insights into the behavior of paraffin crystals and their applications in various industries.
