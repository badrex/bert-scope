tldr: Edmund Halley presents a theory on the variation of the magnetic compass, explaining the deflection of the compass needle from the true meridian. He proposes that the Earth acts as a giant magnet with four magnetic poles, influencing the compass needle's direction. This theory helps to understand compass variations observed in different parts of the world.
