tldr: The study investigates the functional organization of the cuttlefish brain, Sepia officinalis, through electrical stimulation. The research reveals new divisions in the brain and classifies the suboesophageal centers as lower and intermediate motor centers. The supraoesophageal lobes contain higher motor centers and silent areas. The findings are discussed in terms of Sanders & Young's physiological classification of the brain.
