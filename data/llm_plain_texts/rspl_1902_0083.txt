tldr: The author, Augustus D. Waller, conducted experiments on incubated hen's eggs to study the electrical activity within them. He discovered "blaze-currents," which are electrical reactions that can be used to determine if an egg has a living embryo. The presence of these currents indicates the progress of development within the egg. Waller's findings have implications for understanding the relationship between electrical activity and life processes in living organisms.
