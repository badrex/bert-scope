tldr: The authors determined the structure of hen egg-white lysozyme using X-ray crystallography. They found that the molecule has an ellipsoidal shape with a marked cleft and a mix of alpha-helix and irregular conformations. The structure and active site of the enzyme were analyzed, providing insights into its function as an antimicrobial agent.
