tldr: Researchers examined the behavior of sunspots over a ten-year period and found a connection between the spots' growth and waning and the position of Venus in the solar system. They concluded that the behavior of sunspots appears to be influenced by the position of Venus, with spots dissolving as they approach the planet and breaking out and increasing as they move away. This discovery does not suggest that Venus is the cause of the sunspot cycle, but it does indicate a relationship between the two.
