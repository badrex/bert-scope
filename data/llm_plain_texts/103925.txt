tldr: A man's arm was torn off in a mill accident, but surprisingly, he did not experience significant blood loss. The surgeon, Mr. John Belchier, successfully treated the injury and the patient eventually recovered. This case is unique due to the lack of blood loss and the successful healing despite the severity of the injury.
