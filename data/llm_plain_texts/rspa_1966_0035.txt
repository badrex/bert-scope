tldr: The authors conducted experiments on superfluid helium films and discovered two types of films: normal and thick. They found that the thick film exhibits an enhanced transfer rate, which can be affected by disturbances such as bath surface agitation and mechanical vibrations. The study provides insights into the behavior of superfluid helium films and their response to external disturbances.
