tldr: The author discusses the decomposition of nitrotoluylic acid and the properties of its products. They describe the preparation and analysis of nitrotoluylamide and its reaction with reducing agents. The study of its properties led to the discovery of a new acid, which may be an analogue of carbanilic acid or anthranilic acid. This research has implications for the potential introduction of new substances related to salicylic acid and its derivatives.
