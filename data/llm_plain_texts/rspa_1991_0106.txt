tldr: The author explores the asymptotic behavior of the gamma function and discovers that infinitely many subdominant exponentials appear when crossing the Stokes lines. By using Borel summation and a series of subtractions, the smooth switching-on of these exponentials can be revealed and analyzed. This research provides a deeper understanding of the gamma function and its behavior in the complex plane.
