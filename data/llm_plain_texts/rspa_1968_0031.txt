tldr: The authors investigate the coupling problem for ladder representations of the group U(p, q). They explore the local and global properties of ladder representations and present the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for ladder representations in the tensor product of two ladder representations. The study focuses on the structure of ladder representations, their realization in different Hilbert spaces, and the existence of global unitary representations of the universal covering group.
