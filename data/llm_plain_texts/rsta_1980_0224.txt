tldr: The authors conducted a lead isotopic study of young volcanic rocks from different tectonic environments, such as mid-ocean ridges, ocean islands, and island arcs. They found that ocean island leads are more radiogenic than mid-ocean ridge basalt leads and that their differences can be explained by mantle differentiation and mixing. The observed chemical and isotopic heterogeneity in young volcanic rocks is considered to be a result of long-term as well as short-term mantle differentiation and mixing.
