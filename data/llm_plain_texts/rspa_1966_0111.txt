tldr: The authors studied the influence of surface active compounds on lubrication using a slow-running four-ball machine. They found that the oil film was significantly affected by the additive, with a peak in scuffing load when the additive and carrier had the same chain length and shape. These results support the existence of long-range forces and provide an explanation for lubrication failure using the Langmuir isotherm. The authors also investigated the effect of various long-chain polar compounds, such as acids, amines, and alcohols, on the lubrication process.
