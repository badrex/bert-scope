revised_title: 'Geomagnetic and Gravitational Evidence for Bumps on the Earth's Core-Mantle Boundary'
semantic_tags:

  - Core-Mantle Boundary
  - Gravitational Anomalies
  - Earth's Interior
  - Deep Mantle Convection
tldr: The authors investigate the correlation between the Earth's gravitational and magnetic fields, finding a high correlation that supports the presence of bumps on the core-mantle boundary. These bumps contribute to the broad features of the gravitational field and have implications for the structure and dynamics of the Earth's deep interior.
