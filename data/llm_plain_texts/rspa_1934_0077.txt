tldr: The authors conducted experiments using heavy hydrogen (deuterium) and observed a significant reaction when bombarding deuterium with deuterons (diplons). This reaction resulted in the emission of charged particles, specifically protons. The authors concluded that the process involved the formation of a helium nucleus, which then broke up rapidly, releasing protons and a hydrogen isotope with a mass of 3. This discovery provided evidence for the existence of a stable isotope of hydrogen with a mass of 3, known as tritium.
