revised_title: 'Vibratory Movements and Explosive Waves in Gaseous Mixtures'
semantic_tags:
  - Explosives

  - Detonation
tldr: The author studied the connection between vibratory movements and explosive waves in gaseous mixtures, specifically coal gas and air. They discovered that the detonating stage (explosive wave) is always preceded by vibratory movements. The author also found that the whole column of unignited gas in the tube, adjacent or distant from the flame, is induced into a more receptive condition by the vibrating flame, allowing the chemical reaction to proceed at a faster rate.
