tldr: This article discusses the calibration methods for area-detector diffractometers, focusing on the ENRAF-NONIUS FAST system. The author explores various techniques for determining the overall response of electronic area-detectors and addresses the challenges of using different calibration wavelengths and the tails of the point-spread functions. The article provides insights into the integral response of area-detector diffractometers and the effects of illumination on calibration accuracy.
