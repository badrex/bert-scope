tldr: The article investigates the inward rectifying currents in rat olfactory receptor neurons using patch-clamp techniques. The researchers found that these neurons express a hyperpolarization-activated current, which is consistent with inward rectification in various other tissues. This current may play a role in controlling cell excitability during the response to some odorants.
