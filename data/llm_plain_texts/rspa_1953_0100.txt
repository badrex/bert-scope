tldr: The authors conducted a quantitative theoretical investigation of the role of photo-ionization in the development of ionization currents in gases under uniform electric fields. They applied the calculation to the case of air and compared the results with experimental data. The study supports the view that photo-ionization does not play a predominant role as a secondary ionization process leading to the electrical breakdown of air at values of the spark parameter em mm Hg in uniform fields.
