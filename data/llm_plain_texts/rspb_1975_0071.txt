tldr: This study examines the evolution of British and American Middle and Upper Jurassic Gryphaea, focusing on their biometric characteristics. The research reveals phyletic trends in Gryphaea, such as increased size, reduced shell height, and weaker sulci. The findings also show that Gryphaea did not arise repeatedly from a normal oyster stock and that their ecology differs from that of ostreids throughout their history.
