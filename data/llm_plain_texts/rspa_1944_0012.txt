tldr: The authors conducted an X-ray analysis of an alloy of copper, iron, and nickel, which dissociates into face-centered cubic phases at lower temperatures. They discovered that extinction effects significantly influence the intensities of the diffraction lines, and developed an analytical treatment to correct for extinction, allowing them to better understand the alloy's dissociation process.
