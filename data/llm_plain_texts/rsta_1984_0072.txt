tldr: The article discusses the role of predicates in proving the correctness of programs, particularly in non-deterministic systems. It highlights the importance of invariance and non-determinacy in programming languages and the use of the predicate calculus for program derivation. The author also touches upon the challenges of using formal techniques and the need for careful choice of extra-logical primitives and notation.
