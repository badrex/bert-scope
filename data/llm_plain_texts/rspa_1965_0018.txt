tldr: This article explores the connection between hypervirial theorems and perturbation theory in quantum mechanics. It demonstrates that if the first-order perturbation correction to the expectation value of an operator is zero, the wave function satisfies a hypervirial theorem. Conversely, if a hypervirial theorem is satisfied, the expectation values of certain operators have vanishing first-order corrections. The article also discusses the implications of these findings for improving approximate quantum-mechanical wave functions and provides examples of their application, such as the ground state of the helium atom.
