tldr: 'The author shares observations made in mines and at sea, leading to a conjecture about the origin of wind. John Gill, experienced in mineral affairs, notes that air is present when water is found underground but not when it is absent. Additionally, the author reports on unusually large hailstones that fell in Suffolk, weighing up to 12 shillings and 6 pence.'
