tldr: This obituary highlights the life and work of James Cossar Ewart, a Scottish zoologist and geneticist. Ewart made significant contributions to the fields of zoology, marine biology, and genetics. He conducted research on the electric organ in skates, the development of the horse's skeleton, and the study of equine evolution through experimental breeding. Ewart's work on Telegony and his research on the ancestry and evolution of horses using crossbreeding methods provided valuable insights into the origins of modern horses and ponies.
