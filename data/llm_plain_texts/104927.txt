tldr: The Charr-Fish, also known as the torgoch, is a unique species found in North Wales. This article describes its appearance, habitat, and seasonal behavior. The fish is similar to a trout but has a slimy texture and is found in lakes and pools at the foot of Snowden. They appear during winter and are in short supply, making them a delicacy. The author also mentions a pool in his parish called Quellyn, where the Charr-Fish can be found after Christmas and sometimes even in midsummer.
