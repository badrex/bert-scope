tldr: The authors conducted an X-ray diffraction study to investigate the existence of zero-point energy in the Rock-Salt Lattice. They applied the laws of scattering to the distribution of charge in sodium and chlorine atoms and calculated the coherent atomic scattering for X-radiation. The results tested the agreement between the observed scattering power and the calculated atomic model, and provided insights into the presence or absence of zero-point energy in the crystal lattice.
