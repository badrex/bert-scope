tldr: 'This study examines the development and biology of the larva of Saccoglossus horsti, a species of Enteropneusta. The research focuses on the external and internal morphology of the larvae, as well as their cleavage patterns, growth, and behavior. The findings contribute to the understanding of the life history and development of the Harrimanidae family, which has similarities to the indirect development of some Ptychoderidae members.'
