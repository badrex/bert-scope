tldr: This article explores the form of divergencies in quantum electrodynamics using functional equations and mathematical analysis. The author demonstrates that the cut-off cannot be made arbitrarily large without the 'bare-particle' charge becoming imaginary. The study provides insights into the properties of renormalized quantum electrodynamics and the limitations of the cut-off value in maintaining the Hermitian nature of the 'bare-particle' Hamiltonian.
