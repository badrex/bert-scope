tldr: 'This article presents a dynamic model for estimating the day-to-day response of crops to nitrogen fertilizer. The model combines theories on plant processes, such as the demand for nitrogen, percentage nitrogen in plant material, and root development in soil. Simulation studies indicate that failure to account for variations in subsoil nitrate and rooting depth is a major cause of uncertainty in forecasting fertilizer requirements.'
