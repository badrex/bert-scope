tldr: The authors conducted experiments to produce single crystals of aluminium and studied their tensile properties. They found that the largest crystals form at the minimum stress required for growth, and the ultimate stress is lowest for the largest crystals. The experiments also showed that the tensile properties of aluminium can be improved by producing larger single crystals.
