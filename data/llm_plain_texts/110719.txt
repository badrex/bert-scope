revised_title: Further Observations on Embryology and Cell Development
semantic_tags:

tldr: The author provides additional insights into embryonic development, specifically the formation of the chorion and the role of cells in its development. They observe that a layer of cells remains surrounding the "zona" after the thinner membrane has formed, and these cells contribute to the thickening of the chorion. The author also notes the presence of pellucid globules and discoid objects in the fluid space between the "zona" and the thinner membrane, which may play a role in cell growth and development.
