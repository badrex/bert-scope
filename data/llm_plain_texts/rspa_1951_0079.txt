tldr: This study investigates the existence and properties of second-order pressure variations in standing water waves. Experiments were conducted in a tank to verify the theoretical predictions and demonstrate how these pressure variations can be used to determine the amount of wave reflection from different types of obstacles. The findings have implications for understanding ocean waves and their potential role in causing small oscillations of the Earth's crust, known as microseisms.
