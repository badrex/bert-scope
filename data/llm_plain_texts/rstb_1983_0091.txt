revised_title: Immunopathological Mechanisms in Bacterial-Host Interactions: A Focus on Group A Streptococcus
semantic_tags:
  - Immunopathology

  - Cross-reactive antigens
  - Immune response suppression
tldr: This article discusses the various immunopathological mechanisms employed by bacteria, particularly the group A streptococcus, to cause damage to the host. The author groups these mechanisms into three categories: microbial mimicry, immune response suppression, and release of substances with specific biological properties. The article highlights the role of cross-reactive antigens in inducing immunopathological damage in diseases like rheumatic fever and chorea, as well as the suppression of the host's immune response in post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis.
