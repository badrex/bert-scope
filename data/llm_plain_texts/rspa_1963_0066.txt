tldr: The authors studied the effects of isotopes on the transfer of vibrational energy in gaseous collisions. They found that even after accounting for mass differences, a residual preference for hydrogen over deuterium was observed as a catalyst in some cases. This could be due to rotational effects during the collision or the origin of intermolecular repulsions. The study highlights the importance of understanding molecular interactions and the need for more accurate information about intermolecular repulsions to advance knowledge about energy transfer.
