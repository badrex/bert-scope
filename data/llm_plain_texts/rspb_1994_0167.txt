tldr: The article investigates the role of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) in generating osmo-dependent slow inward membrane currents (Sin) in follicle-enclosed oocytes of Xenopus laevis. The study finds that cAMP activates Sin currents that may play a role in regulating the volume of the follicular cells-oocyte complex. The mechanisms underlying the ACh responses remain unknown.
