tldr: The author, William Brakenridge, analyzes the number of inhabitants in London and Westminster using the yearly bills of mortality from 1704 to 1753. He observes that the population increased until around 1728, remained stable until 1743, and then started to decrease. He also discusses factors affecting the population, such as the number of dissenters, people living unmarried, and the impact of new buildings in Westminster. Additionally, he compares mortality rates in London and the country, finding that people in London have a higher mortality rate due to factors like air quality.
