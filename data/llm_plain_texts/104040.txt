tldr: In October 1734, an earthquake was felt in Sussex, causing shaking and vibrations in many houses. The author collected accounts from various locations and analyzed the event, noting that the shock was more felt towards the seaside and that it extended more from east to west than north to south. This information was shared with the Royal Society, providing valuable insights into the nature of earthquakes at the time.
