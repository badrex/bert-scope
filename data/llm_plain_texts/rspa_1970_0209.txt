tldr: This article studies time sequences of axially symmetric static configurations in general relativity and identifies the restrictions that characterize physically allowable time sequences. The authors find that these restrictions can be expressed as a limitation on the time dependence of the multipole moments, which are defined by the Weyl and Levi-Civita solutions. This work clarifies the concepts of mass and energy transfer in the near field and provides a deeper understanding of energy transfer in strong gravitational fields.
