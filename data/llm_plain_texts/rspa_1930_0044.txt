revised_title: 'Quantitative Corrections for Photographic Measurements of X-ray Intensities in Crystal Analysis'

  - Photographic measurements
  - Intensity corrections
  - Geometrical correction factor
  - Film factor
tldr: The authors discuss two corrections necessary for accurate measurement of X-ray intensities in crystal analysis. The Geometrical Correction Factor accounts for the effect of crystal orientation on the intensity measurement, while the Film Factor corrects for the obliquity of incidence on the photographic film. These corrections help improve the accuracy of intensity ratios in X-ray crystallography.
