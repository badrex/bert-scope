tldr: This article discusses the development of a non-linear field theory, focusing on the quantization and Lorentz invariance. The author suggests that this theory may be used to describe the moment of inertia and could be a step forward in the analysis of operators that create or destroy particles. The article also mentions the dimensional model and the source field, which are essential for understanding the natural behavior of particles.
