tldr: The author conducted experiments on the change of form in wrought iron and other metals when heated and then cooled by partial immersion in water. They observed that metals like wrought iron, cast iron, and steel undergo significant changes in form, while metals like tin, brass, gun-metal, and zinc show slight expansion. The results provide insights into the behavior of metals during heat treatment and contribute to the understanding of material science and metallurgy.
