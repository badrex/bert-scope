tldr: The authors studied the rejection of weakly antigenic skin grafts in rats and found that the rejection process involved the proliferation of donor-type epidermal cells and dermal fibroblasts. This hyperplasia was not related to surgical trauma and was a consequence of the immune response. The findings have implications for understanding the relationship between weak histoincompatibility and tumor-host interactions.
