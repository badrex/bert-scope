tldr: In this letter, Mr. Newton discusses the advantages of using reflecting telescopes, which have better reflectivity than glass lenses. He also provides tips on preserving the metal surfaces of these telescopes, such as keeping them dry and using certain liquids to protect them. He believes that with further research, even better materials for reflecting telescopes may be discovered.
