revised_title: 'Crown Ether Templates in the Formation of Zeolite Polymorphs'
semantic_tags:
  - Zeolite Y
  - Crown ether templates
  - Hexagonal and cubic polymorphs
  - Crystal growth
  - High-resolution electron microscopy
tldr: The authors synthesized hexagonal and cubic polymorphs of zeolite Y using crown ether templates and studied their intergrowth mechanism using high-resolution electron microscopy. They identified double-six ring units as the key unit for crystal growth and observed oscillatory growth in syntheses with multiple crown ether preparations. The structure-directing role of crown ethers is also discussed.
