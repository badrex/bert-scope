semantic_tags:
  - Vibrating Systems
  - Inverse Problems
  - Stiffness Matrix
  - Mass Matrix
  - Block Jacobi Matrix
tldr: This article presents a theory for reconstructing a symmetric block tridiagonal matrix, or block Jacobi matrix, from a spectral function. The theory is applied to inverse vibration problems, enabling the reconstruction and separation of stiffness and mass matrices in multidimensional vibrating systems.
