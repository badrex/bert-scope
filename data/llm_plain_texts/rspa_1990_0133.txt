tldr: The author presents a laminar flamelet model for pre-mixed turbulent combustion, where a characteristic length scale controls the flamelet surface-to-volume ratio. The model is compared with experimental data, leading to an experimental determination of the ratio of effective to true laminar burning velocities as a function of Karlovitz number. This study helps in understanding turbulent flame propagation and assessing the accuracy of theoretical models of turbulent combustion.
