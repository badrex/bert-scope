tldr: The authors investigate the luminescence and phosphorescence of solid nitrogen when bombarded by cathode rays. They discover that the green and red bands in the phosphorescent spectrum are composed of multiple components, and that phosphorescence occurs only below a certain temperature. The intense luminescence and phosphorescence observed in this study could have implications for understanding the behavior of solid materials under high-energy particle bombardment.
