tldr: The authors introduce a method called the "difference-periodogram" for quickly identifying short periodicities in data. This method involves dividing a dataset into sections, calculating the mean values, and plotting these means on a time scale. By analyzing the resulting curve, one can identify periodic variations and determine their periods and amplitudes. This technique is useful for studying various types of data, such as monthly rainfall amounts.
