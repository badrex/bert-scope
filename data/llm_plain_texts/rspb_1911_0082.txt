tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of chloroform anaesthesia on lung ventilation and gas exchange in animals. They used a plethysmograph to measure pulmonary ventilation and found that the decrease in oxy-hemoglobin levels during chloroform narcosis was not due to a slowing of respiration but rather to the direct interference of chloroform with the oxygen transport function of red blood cells.
