tldr: The article discusses the eddy-current losses in cylindrical conductors and their impact on the alternating current resistances of short coils. It explores the effects of stranding and provides formulae for the effective resistance of coils, considering factors such as coil length, frequency, and wire section. The study aims to determine the conditions that minimize eddy-current losses and improve coil performance in high-frequency currents.
