tldr: This article explores the dynamical aspects of the Jahn-Teller effect in doubly degenerate electronic states. It focuses on the interaction between electronic and nuclear motions in a symmetrical non-linear molecule and provides a mathematical model to explain the vibronic energy levels and their classification. The study also discusses the selection rules for transitions between vibronic levels and the oscillator strengths of absorption or emission bands involving Jahn-Teller distorted states.
