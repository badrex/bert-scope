tldr: The authors present a physico-chemical model of element separation in the differentiation of mantle material. They discuss the role of incongruent melting of metasilicates and the concentration of silica and lithophilic elements in the liquid phase. The study also investigates the phase equilibria of silicate systems at high pressures and the separation of elements during zone melting of the silicate phase of chondrites.
