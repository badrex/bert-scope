tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments on various plant varieties to study the effects of root-treatment with trichloroacetate on external leaf waxes. They found that the treatment led to significant changes in the composition of leaf waxes, particularly in Brassica oleracea varieties. This research contributes to our understanding of plant biochemistry and physiology.'
