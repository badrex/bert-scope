tldr: The study investigates the longitudinal coordination of motor output during swimming in Xenopus embryos. It reports a re-evaluation of rostro-caudal delays and their distribution along the embryo during swimming. The authors also examine the effects of pharmacological manipulations and lesions on the nature and balance of longitudinal coupling by affecting local levels of neuronal excitability. The results suggest that the central pattern generator of Xenopus behaves as a series of coupled oscillators, contributing to the observed rostro-caudal delay.
