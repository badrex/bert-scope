tldr: The author conducted simultaneous thermometric and hygrometric observations at heights of 4 and 170 feet to study the effects of height on temperature and humidity. The results showed that the daily temperature range was reduced at higher altitudes, and the mean temperature at 170 feet was slightly lower than at 4 feet. These findings provided valuable information on the form of the daily temperature curve at considerable heights above the ground.
