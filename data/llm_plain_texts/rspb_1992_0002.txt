tldr: The author discovered that the Adh locus in Drosophila melanogaster has synergistic effects on the quantities of several other enzymes. This study found that the Adh-Fast (F) and Adh-Slow (S) alleles affect the levels of six out of seven enzymes in the fruit fly, suggesting a complex interaction between genes and their multiple phenotypic consequences.
