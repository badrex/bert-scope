revised_title: Formation of Magnetic Singularities by Time-Dependent Collapse of an X-Type Magnetic Field
semantic_tags:
  - Magnetohydrodynamics
  - Plasma physics
  - Magnetic reconnection
  - Solar physics
  - Astrophysics
tldr: The authors study the formation of magnetic singularities in an X-type magnetic field through time-dependent collapse. They analyze the behavior of plasma and magnetic fields in this process, which is relevant to understanding magnetic reconnection in solar and astrophysical contexts.
