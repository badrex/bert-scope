tldr: The authors detected and measured the ground state rotational spectrum of a hydrogen-bonded heterodimer formed from water and hydrogen cyanide using pulsed-nozzle, Fourier-transform microwave spectroscopy. They determined rotational constants, centrifugal distortion constants, and nuclear quadrupole coupling constants for various isotopic species. The analysis indicates that the heterodimer is effectively planar, with water acting as the proton acceptor and hydrogen cyanide as the proton donor in the hydrogen bond.
