tldr: This article discusses the problem of explaining central excitation and inhibition through chemical transmission, focusing on acetylcholine at neuromuscular junctions and synapses in autonomic ganglia. The author explores different mechanisms, such as over-depolarization, release at different parts of the same cell, and different synapses having opposite effects. The possibility of different chemical transmitters for excitation and inhibition is also considered, but the distribution of cholinergic and non-cholinergic neurons does not clearly support this idea.
