tldr: 'Sir Norman Lockyer was a prominent scientific figure who made significant contributions to the field of solar physics. He discovered the method of observing solar prominences, which had previously only been observed during total solar eclipses. Lockyer also identified the presence of helium in the sun, named the solar chromosphere, and played a key role in the development of solar physics as a scientific discipline.'
