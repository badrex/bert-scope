tldr: The author discusses the problem of diffuse spots found in X-ray crystallography and proposes an alternative analysis where atoms are assumed to stick together in small, nearly rigid groups. This approach could provide a different perspective on crystal structure and might be useful for understanding phenomena like elasticity and plasticity in metals.
