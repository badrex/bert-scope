tldr: The author critically examines Meldrum's rules for handling ships during hurricanes in the Southern Indian Ocean, using published observations and unpublished records from the Observatory of Mauritius. The study confirms the value of Meldrum's rules and provides additional explanations and modifications for handling ships in hurricanes. The author also discusses the nature of hurricanes, their relation to the south-east trade, and the belt of intensified trade wind, which poses challenges for ship handling.
