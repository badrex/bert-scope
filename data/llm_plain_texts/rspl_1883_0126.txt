tldr: This article presents experimental research on cerebral physiology, focusing on the effects of electrical stimulation on the cerebral cortex and its connection with the rest of the nervous system. The authors, Victor Horsley and Edward Albert Schäfer, conducted experiments on monkeys, observing the resulting movements and muscle contractions. They discovered that stimulating specific parts of the cortex led to coordinated movements of the trunk and limbs, providing insights into the localization of motor functions in the brain.
