tldr: The author reviews various methods for calculating fluid flow through constrictions, focusing on Hugoniot's method, which is shown to be more informative and versatile than other methods. The study covers gas flow through nozzles, liquid flow over broad-crested weirs, and liquid flow through Venturi flumes with various shapes. The author also demonstrates that the throat velocity in liquid flow is equal to the local velocity of a long wave.
