tldr: This study investigates the flow of viscous fluids through orifices, using a heavy engine oil with a wide range of viscosities. The researchers found that the coefficient of discharge (Cd) varies depending on the head and viscosity of the fluid, and that the flow behavior can be explained by the balance between viscosity and inertia forces. The results provide insights into the design of orifices and the behavior of fluids in various applications.
