tldr: The study investigates the spatial arrangement of chromosomes in root-tip metaphase cells of Aegilops umbellulata, a diploid grass species. Using electron micrographs and computer analysis, the researchers found evidence suggesting that centromeres are not randomly arranged on the metaphase plate but are ordered in two haploid sets, following a model based on spatial association of corresponding arms of similar size on heterologous chromosomes.
