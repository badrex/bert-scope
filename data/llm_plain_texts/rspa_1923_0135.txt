tldr: This article investigates the magnetic properties of paramagnetic double sulphates at low temperatures, focusing on cobalt compounds. The study finds that all members of the series of cobalt compounds follow the same type of law regarding the dependence of susceptibility on temperature. The results confirm that the magnetic properties of these compounds are influenced by their crystalline structure and the direct connection between dilution and the A in a paramagnetic substance.
