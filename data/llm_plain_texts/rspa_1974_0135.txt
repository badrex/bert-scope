tldr: This article explores the theoretical study of simultaneous correction of third-order aperture aberration and axial chromatic aberration in high-voltage electron microscopy. The authors investigate the use of quadrupole-octopole lenses to compensate for aberrations in a round objective lens, considering factors such as lens stability, electrostatic fields, and chromatic aberration of magnification. They conclude that chromatic correction is feasible for accelerating voltages up to a certain limit, and provide tabular results for systems designed for various resolutions.
