tldr: In 1771, Captain Wallis observed a solar eclipse at George's Island and reported the event to George Witchell. Witchell calculated the difference in meridians between George's Island and Greenwich using the observation data. The article also includes other astronomical observations made at the Royal Academy in Portsmouth, such as the transit of Venus and the occultation of stars by the Moon.
