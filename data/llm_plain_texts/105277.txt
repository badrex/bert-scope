tldr: In 1757, James Bradley, the Astronomer Royal, observed and recorded the path and movements of a comet. He determined that the comet's trajectory was parabolic and calculated its position and elements, which could be used to predict its future appearances. Bradley's observations and calculations were made using various instruments, including a seven-foot telescope and a sector constructed by George Graham.
