tldr: The author, Edmund Barrell, observed and documented two instances of the Northern Lights, or Aurora Borealis, in 1716 and 1717 from Sutton at Hone in Kent. He described the appearance, location, and behavior of the phenomena, including the shooting of bright rays and a long streak extending across the sky. Barrell also mentioned the presence of the moon during one of the events, which affected the visibility of the aurora.
