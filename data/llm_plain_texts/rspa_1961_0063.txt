revised_title: Exact Spherical Gravitational Waves in General Relativity

tldr: The author presents an exact solution of Einstein's empty space-time field equations representing an axially symmetric pulse wave with a spherical wave front. The solution confirms the presence of radiation through the Riemann tensor's asymptotic behavior. The wave permanently distorts the space-time, indicating that it carries energy, but the specific source of this energy remains unknown until background terms can be built into the metric.
