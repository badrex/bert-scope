tldr: This article examines the changing environmental conditions in Great Britain and Ireland during the Devensian (Last) cold stage, focusing on the vertebrates of that period. The author discusses the faunal history, the occurrence of fossil vertebrates, and the differences between the Ipswichian stage and the Devensian. The article also provides insights into the Early and Middle Devensian faunas, their associated vegetation, and the impact of climate change on the vertebrate fauna.
