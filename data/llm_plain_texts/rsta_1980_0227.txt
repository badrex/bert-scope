  - Ablation droplets
tldr: The authors conducted studies on cosmic spherules found in deep-sea sediments and provided evidence that they are not ablation droplets from meteorites or comets. They support this by analyzing the size distribution, examining the spherules with scanning electron microscopy, and comparing them to grindwheel sparks. The authors estimate the influx of cosmic spherules at about 14 tonnes per day, making it unlikely that meteorites or comets could account for the majority of these particles.
