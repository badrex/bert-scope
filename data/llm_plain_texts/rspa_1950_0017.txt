tldr: The authors improve the valence-bond theory for conjugated molecules by adding polar structures, which show two electrons on one center and none on another, making these centers carry negative and positive charges. They apply this new method to ethylene, assigning long-wave-length bands in its spectrum and evaluating new parameters. This work helps in understanding the -electron states in aromatic and conjugated molecules and their reactivity.
