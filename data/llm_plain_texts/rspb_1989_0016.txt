tldr: Researchers developed an algorithm to predict and observe ligand point positions at hydrogen-bonding regions on protein surfaces. They tested the algorithm using three examples: water molecule positions in myoglobin and plastocyanin, and hydrogen-bonded atoms in methotrexate and NADPH co-crystallized with dihydrofolate reductase, and amidinophenyl-pyruvate co-crystallized with trypsin. The algorithm's predictions were in agreement with experimental data, demonstrating its potential for automated site-directed drug design.
