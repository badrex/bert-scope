tldr: The authors conducted optical excitation spectroscopy on the Luna 24 sample 24125 and discovered the presence of Fe3+ ions in the plagioclase component. The spectrum closely resembles that of Fe3+ in plagioclase-rich Apollo samples and terrestrial calcic plagioclases. The study provides insights into the concentration of Fe3+ in the plagioclase structure and its relation to the lunar regolith's reducing environment.
