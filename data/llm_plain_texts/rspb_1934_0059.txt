tldr: This study investigates the relationship between the parathyroid glands and the effects of irradiated ergosterol (a precursor to vitamin D). The authors found that both substances cause similar effects, such as increased calcium levels in the blood and urine, and vascular changes in the gastrointestinal tract. They concluded that there is an intimate physiological relationship between the parathyroid hormone and the action of irradiated ergosterol, possibly through direct stimulation of parathyroid tissue by the sterol.
