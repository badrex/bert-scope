tldr: The authors studied the elastic and inelastic scattering of 9.5 MeV protons by He, C, N, O, F, Ne, A, Kr, and Xe nuclei using a nuclear emulsion method. They measured differential cross-sections for elastic scattering and discussed the results in terms of the optical model. The inelastic scattering was also analyzed, providing insights into the absorption processes in the complex part of the nuclear potential.
