tldr: The authors estimate the degree of lithification and structure densities compatible with lunar in situ seismic profiles in the top 30 km of the Moon. They find that the upper 1 km consists of highly fractured lithic units, while the deeper layers have only moderate fracture. The steep thermal gradient in the upper 1 km and possible temperature rise at 1 km depth suggest widespread annealing of near-surface material.
