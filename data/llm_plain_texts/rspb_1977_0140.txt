tldr: This study calculates the electronic charge distribution in various biologically active amines, including acetylcholine, dopamine, histamine, and -aminobutyric acid, using ab initio molecular orbital techniques. The findings suggest that the traditional pictures of electronic structure in these molecules may be inaccurate, which could impact our understanding of neurotransmitter receptor binding sites.
