revised_title: 'Chemical Electron Emission Theory and Its Application to Haloid Reactions'
semantic_tags:
  - Chemical electron emission
  - Haloid reactions
  - Electron de-excitation
  - Excitation functions
  - Temperature effects
tldr: The authors develop a theory of chemical electron emission and apply it to certain reactions involving haloids. They discuss the energy distribution function, electron de-excitation, and the effects of temperature on the process. The effective maximum energy of emitted electrons is determined, which can be used for theoretical analysis.
