tldr: The article examines the tropinone synthesis of Sir Robert Robinson and its impact on his career and the field of organic chemistry. Robinson's synthesis was a pioneering example of a calculated biomimetic synthesis, which influenced chemists' attitudes towards natural product structures and biosynthesis. Despite some of his early biogenetic suggestions being incorrect, his principles were valid and contributed to the development of the field.
