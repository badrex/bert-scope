tldr: The authors studied the thermal decomposition and polymerization of ethane and ethylene by heating the reactants to 600Â°C for short time intervals and measuring the products of reaction by chemical analysis. They found that the first products of ethane decomposition are ethylene, hydrogen, and a small amount of methane. The subsequent reactions involve both ethane and ethylene, resulting in the formation of methane, propylene, a compound of the formula C4H8, and higher hydrocarbons. The kinetics of the proposed mechanism hold good over a wide range of ethane-ethylene mixtures, and values for the velocity constants of all these reactions are given.
