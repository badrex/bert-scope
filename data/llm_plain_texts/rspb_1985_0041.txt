tldr: The study investigates the lung morphology and gas exchange apparatus of the African lungfish (Protopterus aethiopicus) using morphometric techniques. The lung's volume and exchange tissue composition are analyzed, and the results are compared with other vertebrates to understand the lung's evolution and its role in air-breathing vertebrates.
