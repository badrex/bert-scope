tldr: The article investigates the ionic and charge-displacement currents evoked by temperature jumps in Xenopus oocytes. The temperature jump responses were found to have two distinct components: a slow maintained current and a fast transient current. The slow current is likely due to temperature-dependent changes in the 'leakage' current of the oocyte, while the fast component may arise from the displacement of charges across the plasma membrane.
