tldr: This article investigates the influence of lateral variations in geological structure on stress patterns in a transcurrent interplate deformation boundary. The authors construct an effective anisotropic model to study the consequences of the Transverse Ranges' east-west fault orientation on the overall stress and strain field in the southern California region. The model predicts enhanced seismic energy release and clockwise rigid rotation, which is supported by palaeomagnetic studies.
