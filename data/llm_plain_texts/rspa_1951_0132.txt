tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the spontaneous magnetization of cobalt in its hexagonal and face-centred cubic forms. They found that the face-centred cubic form had greater magnetization and that the materials' magnetization followed different reduced equations of state. The results showed that the reduced magnetic equation of state is structure-dependent.
