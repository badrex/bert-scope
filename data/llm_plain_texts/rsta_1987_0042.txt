tldr: The article discusses the behavior of electrons in a tokamak, a device used for controlled nuclear fusion. It explores the concept of plasma magnetic insulation and the phenomenon of profile consistency, which is the insensitivity of temperature profiles to power profile deposition. The authors propose a model of a relaxed state with minimal total energy, which explains the self-organization of temperature and current density profiles in tokamaks.
