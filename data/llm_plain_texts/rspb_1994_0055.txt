tldr: This study investigates the relationship between tail length, asymmetry, and flight performance in red-billed streamertails. The researchers found that birds with elongated tails and increased asymmetry had a harder time maneuvering through a maze, demonstrating that there is a cost to having a longer and more asymmetrical tail. This suggests that birds with high quality may produce more symmetrical ornaments to minimize these costs.
