tldr: 'A letter from Mr. Clark to Mr. Ludlow describes the discovery of Roman antiquities and ancient coins found near the Devizes in Wiltshire. The coins were found in a pot buried under the ground and contained various figures and devices. The letter also mentions the discovery of unique pottery and a pot containing a whitish powder, which was initially thought to be the ashes of human bones but later proved to be a different substance.'
