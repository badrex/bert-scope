tldr: The article investigates the polarization state of light scattered by fluids in electric and magnetic fields using spatial symmetry operations and reciprocity relations. The study establishes constraints on the forms of the Mueller matrices describing Rayleigh scattering by fluids and assesses the response of various scattering systems to different input polarization states. This approach provides systematic insight into a wide range of possible differential light-scattering experiments on fluids.
