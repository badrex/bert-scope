tldr: 'In 1727, Robert Nesbitt observed a subterranean fire in a marshy field near Canterbury, Kent. The fire consumed about three acres of ground and emitted a great smoke and strong smell, similar to a brick kiln. The soil in the area was found to be moist and hot, with the heat increasing when exposed to air. Nesbitt believed the fire could be explained as a natural phenomenon similar to fires that occur in hayricks.'
