tldr: The author, A. W. Hofmann, investigates the properties and reactions of carbanilide and sulphocarbanilide, two compounds derived from ammonia. He discovers cyanate of phenyl and sulphocyanide of phenyl through various chemical reactions and examines their characteristics and reactions with other substances. This research contributes to the understanding of diamides and their applications in organic chemistry.
