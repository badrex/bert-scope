tldr: The article discusses the development of a malaria vaccine using sporozoite antigens. The authors explain the rationale behind this approach and describe the characteristics of protective immunity. They identify the circumsporozoite proteins as the main antigens involved in protective immunity and discuss their role in the process of penetration of the parasite into the host's cells. The article also highlights the immunogenicity of these proteins and their potential as target antigens for a vaccine.
