tldr: The author conducted experiments in a heated room to study the effects of heated air on the human body and the albumen ovi. They found that the human body can easily tolerate high temperatures, and the albumen ovi remains fluid even in high heat. The author discusses possible explanations for these phenomena, such as latent heat, fixed and quiescent fire, or different conducting powers of materials. The author also mentions Dr. Priestley's discovery of a new type of air that preserves animal life longer than atmospheric air.
