tldr: The author investigates the properties of dynamo-electric machinery and develops a method to calculate the characteristic curve of a dynamo based on the laws of electromagnetism and the properties of iron. The study also examines factors affecting the performance of dynamo machines, such as the distribution of magnetic induction and the magnetizing force required to produce the field.
