tldr: The authors determined the thermionic constants of graphite by measuring the saturation vapor pressure of the electron gas at different temperatures using Knudsen's effusion method. They found that graphite's work function and effusion constant were insensitive to surface contamination, making this method advantageous for determining thermionic constants. Additionally, the study clarified the relationship between the constants that determine the saturation vapor pressure of electrons and those that determine electron emission from the surface.
