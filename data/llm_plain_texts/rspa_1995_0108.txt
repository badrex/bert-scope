  - Differential Operators
tldr: The authors present a spacetime calculus that is invariant under null rotations, using totally symmetric spinors and four new differential operators. This formalism is useful in studying the geometry of spacelike 2-surfaces and type spacetimes, and it can simplify calculations in general relativity.
