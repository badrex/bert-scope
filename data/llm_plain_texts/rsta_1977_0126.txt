tldr: The article discusses two major igneous events in the evolution of the Moon, which are crucial for understanding its composition and origin. The first event involved large-scale melting and fractionation into crust and mantle, while the second event was a partial melting of the uppermost mantle. The study of lunar basalts provides insights into the Moon's interior and the events that led to its differentiation into a crust, mantle, and possible core. This research is essential for explaining the differences in bulk composition between the Moon and Earth and understanding the origin of the Moon in relation to Earth.
