tldr: The authors investigated the effects of intracellular ionic injections on inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in cat motoneurons. They found that injecting cations and anions into the cells caused a depolarizing shift in the membrane potential, while injecting anions alone caused a slight hyperpolarizing shift. These findings suggest that both cation and anion movements play a role in the generation of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials.
