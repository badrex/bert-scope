tldr: 'After a violent earthquake in Sumatra in 1797, J. Griffiths discovered a rare species of worm shells on the island of Battoo. These shells were found protruding from the mud and coral reefs and were described as being up to 5 feet long. The shells had unique features, such as a double tube structure and a smooth internal surface. The discovery of these shells provided valuable information about the effects of the earthquake on the local marine life and the morphology of these unique creatures.'
