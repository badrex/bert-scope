tldr: The study estimates outcrossing rates and correlated matings in a natural population of the hermaphroditic freshwater snail Ancylus fluviatilis. Using progeny arrays and polymorphic allozyme markers, the researchers found a minimum population-level outcrossing of 10.3%. The results reveal important heterogeneity in the mating system of an animal hermaphrodite and indicate the potential for evolutionary change in the breeding system.
