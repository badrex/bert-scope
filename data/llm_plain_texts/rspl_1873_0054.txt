tldr: 'The author, Robert Mallet, calculates the volume of crushed rock needed for volcanic energy based on the heat generated by the Earth's contraction. He estimates the amount of crushed and extruded rock necessary for the heat to support existing volcanic action and the volume of material heated or molten annually from volcanic cones. Mallet also calculates the actual amount of annual contraction of the Earth, which is responsible for volcanic action, and its effects on the Earth's radius and the length of the day.'
