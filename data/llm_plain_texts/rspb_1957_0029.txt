tldr: The study investigates the collagen and elastin content in the arterial walls of dogs. It found that in all arteries, except the smallest, collagen and elastin together formed about 50% of the dry weight. The study also discovered that the arterial tree can be divided into two regions based on the ratio of elastin to collagen, with the intrathoracic aorta having about twice as much elastin as collagen, and all other vessels having the opposite ratio.
