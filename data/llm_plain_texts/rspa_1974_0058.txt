tldr: This article discusses the scattering of sound waves by irregular surfaces, focusing on near-grazing angles of incidence. The author proposes a theory of multiple surface scattering, which takes into account the effects of multiple interactions of scattered waves with surface irregularities. The theory is valid for small surface roughness and provides a more accurate description of the scattering processes compared to single scattering and Kirchoff diffraction theory.
