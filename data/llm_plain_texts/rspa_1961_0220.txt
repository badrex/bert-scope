tldr: Researchers used a combination of heavy-atom derivatives and crystallography techniques to determine the phase angles of haemoglobin, leading to a three-dimensional Fourier synthesis at 5.5 Ã… resolution. This work provided insights into the structure and function of haemoglobin, a crucial protein for oxygen transport in the blood.
