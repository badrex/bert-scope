tldr: Researchers studied the activity of precentral neurones in conscious monkeys during active and passive movements. They found that 176 neurones showed modulation of their discharge frequency related to specific voluntary movements. The responses of these neurones were examined with natural stimulation of the skin, joints, and muscles of the arm. The study aimed to understand the relationship between peripheral input and the behavior of these neurones during active and passive movements, providing insights into the organization and function of the motor cortex.
