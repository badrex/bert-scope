tldr: This article investigates the influence of turbulence intensity, scale, and vorticity on burning velocity and flame structure using premixed propane-air mixtures in a combustion chamber. The authors identify three distinct regions with different characteristics and propose a mechanism of turbulent flame propagation for each region. The study also examines the similarities between turbulent flames and laminar flames subjected to pressure and velocity fluctuations.
