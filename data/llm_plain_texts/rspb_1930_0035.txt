tldr: The authors investigated the histological structure and reactions of marsupial enamel, comparing it to human enamel. They used staining techniques to analyze the permeability and structure of enamel from young and old marsupial teeth, finding that the enamel's permeability decreases with age and wear. The study provides evidence of the exchange of calcium salts in enamel and dentine, which is essential for tooth development and repair.
