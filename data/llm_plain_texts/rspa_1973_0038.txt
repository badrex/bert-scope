tldr: The author investigates the process of bed-load transport in water, focusing on saltation and the effect of flow depth. They found that an increase in flow depth leads to a decrease in the bed-load transport rate due to the increase in the mean flow velocity. The study provides a consistent and comprehensive set of data on bed-load transport and associated flow quantities, allowing for a better understanding of the phenomenon and its implications in river engineering and geomorphology.
