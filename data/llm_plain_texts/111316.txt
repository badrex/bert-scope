tldr: The author presents a mathematical theory for the stability of loose earth based on the laws of friction. The theory considers the equilibrium of a mass of earth under its own weight and provides methods for determining the pressure of earth against walls and the power of earth to support buildings. The weight of a building that a horizontal bed of earth can support is found to exceed the weight of the earth displaced by the foundation, with the ratio depending on the angle of repose.
