tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the dry wear of steels and found that the transition from severe wear to mild wear is governed by the hardness and state of oxidation of the surfaces. Surface hardening and oxidation play a dual role in this process, with surface hardening providing the substrate hardness required to support the oxide film. The findings have important implications for understanding the behavior of materials under friction and wear.
