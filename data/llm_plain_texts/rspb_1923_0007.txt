tldr: The authors developed a method to accurately measure the wavelength of absorption bands using a spectroscope with two reversed spectra. This method was applied to estimate the percentage saturation of blood with CO gas by measuring the wavelength of the a-absorption band, with an accuracy of approximately 0.6 A.U.
