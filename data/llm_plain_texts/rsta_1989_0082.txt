tldr: This article discusses the search for higher symmetry in string theory, focusing on the "unbroken phase" where symmetries are most likely to be uncovered. The author explores the role of conformal field theory and the potential for breakthroughs in understanding the expansion of string theory. The article also touches on the concept of the "unbroken phase" in string theory and its connection to the deconfinement transition and the restoration of local general covariance.
