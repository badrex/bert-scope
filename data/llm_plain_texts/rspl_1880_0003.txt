tldr: The authors conducted research on the color pigments found in human urine, specifically urobilin and urolutein. They successfully isolated urobilin and studied its properties, while also discovering that urolutein is another pigment present in urine. The research methods included spectroscopic observations and chemical reactions, leading to a better understanding of these pigments and their behavior in urine.
