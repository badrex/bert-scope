tldr: The authors studied the crystal structures of two polyamides, 66 and 6.10 polymers, using X-ray diffraction methods. They found that the structures of these two substances are completely analogous. The chains are planar or very nearly so, and the molecules are linked by hydrogen bonds to form sheets. The optical properties of the fibers are consistent with the structure determined by X-ray methods. The study shows striking similarities between the crystallography of polyamides and that of fibrous proteins.
