tldr: This publication announcement highlights recent research in electromagnetism and light. It discusses Mr. Heaviside's attempt at the rotational aether theory, Professor J. J. Thomson's method of representing electric fields, and Professor Oliver Lodge's search for a magnetic field's effect on light velocity. Additionally, it mentions William Gannon's research on copper electrolysis in vacuo and Arthur Schuster's related work, both communicated by C. B. Clarke.
