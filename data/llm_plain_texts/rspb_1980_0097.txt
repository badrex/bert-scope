tldr: The authors studied the visual sensitivity of the conger eel retina using electroretinogram and whole nerve responses. They found that the spectral sensitivity of the retina closely corresponds to the density spectrum of the conger visual pigment. The retina's high pigment density suggests that only the innermost tier of rod photoreceptors contributes to vision, making the conger eel retina unique among fish species.
