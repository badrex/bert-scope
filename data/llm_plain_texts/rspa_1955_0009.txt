tldr: The authors analyze the growth of spherical blast from a particular charge using numerical integration of equations of motion along characteristics. They calculate the complete field of disturbance and motion of boundaries during the early stages of development, revealing a rapid decline in pressure along both shocks. The study confirms a property of the second blast wave, which turns towards the center of the explosion after initial outward movement.
