tldr: This study investigates the effects of adrenaline on blood lactic acid and muscular exercise. The researchers found that adrenaline causes a rapid increase in lactic acid concentration and a temporary rise in the respiratory quotient during exercise. The study also shows that the removal of excess lactic acid can be as fast during moderate muscular work as during rest. The results suggest that the blood flow through the active muscles and liver may play a role in the removal of glucose and lactic acid.
