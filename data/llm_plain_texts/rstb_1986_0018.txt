tldr: This study analyzes the pursuit behavior of male and female houseflies using high-speed film recordings. Males and females exhibit different chasing and tracking behaviors, with males attacking targets in the air from below and females following targets in a more controlled manner. Both sexes increase their turning rate during pursuit, and male control systems operate more precisely than those of females. The research focuses on understanding the control systems and comparing them to data from optical and electrophysiological measurements.
