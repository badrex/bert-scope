tldr: In this paper, J.C. Maxwell presents a dynamical theory of the electromagnetic field, proposing that magnetic and electric effects occur through the interaction between the medium and electrified or magnetic bodies. He introduces the concept of electromagnetic waves and explains the relationship between electric and magnetic fields, laying the foundation for modern electromagnetism and the understanding of light as an electromagnetic wave.
