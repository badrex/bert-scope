tldr: The authors describe a technique for hypophysectomy, the removal of the pituitary gland, in ferrets. This procedure allows for the study of the effects of the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland on the reproductive organs. The ferret is an ideal animal for this type of research due to its easily accessible reproductive processes and the ease of performing the operation. The authors provide detailed steps for the surgery and discuss the post-operative care of the animals.
