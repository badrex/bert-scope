  - Low-temperature combustion
tldr: This article investigates the influence of molecular structure on hydrocarbon combustion, focusing on the role of intermediates, reaction kinetics, and low-temperature combustion. The authors discuss various factors affecting combustion, such as fuel/oxygen ratio, surface area, and temperature, and propose a mechanism for the combustion of longer chain hydrocarbons.
