tldr: This study used one-dimensional models to analyze the impact of nitrogen oxide emissions from aircraft on stratospheric ozone. The research found that the effects of subsonic and supersonic aircraft emissions were not linearly additive, and the optimum latitude for operating a one-dimensional model was recommended for the Northern Hemisphere.
