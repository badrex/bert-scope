tldr: This study investigates proton ionization in the energy range of 100 to 450 keV, focusing on its importance in understanding auroral and upper-atmospheric collision processes and the design of high-energy injection systems for thermonuclear devices. The authors present experimental results and discuss the ionization cross-section for protons in hydrogen and krypton, comparing their findings with previous research and theoretical predictions.
