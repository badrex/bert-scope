  - Antimicrobial compounds
  - Diaminoacridine compounds
tldr: The authors investigated the relationship between the antiseptic action and chemical constitution of various compounds, including pyridine, quinoline, acridine, and phenazine series. They found that diaminoacridine compounds, such as acriflavine and proflavine, were highly antiseptic and effective in restraining bacterial infections. The study also examined the antiseptic properties of other compounds, like quinoline and naphthoquine derivatives, and their behavior in different mediums like peptone water and serum.
