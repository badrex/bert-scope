tldr: The authors calculate the lattice energy of a paraffin crystal by considering the van der Waals forces between the molecules. They divide the molecules into smaller parts and use point centers of attraction or repulsion to calculate the potential energy. The authors find that the lattice energy depends on the structure elements of the paraffin crystal, such as the distance between carbon atoms, the distance between hydrogen atoms, and the angle between the carbon bonds.
