tldr: The author conducted extensive experiments on rabbits to study ovulation and the degeneration of ova. They discovered that ovulation in rabbits occurs approximately 10 hours after copulation and is influenced by factors such as the presence of sperm and a sufficient blood supply to the ovaries. The author also found that if a doe rabbit does not mate during oestrus, the ripe ova in the ovary will degenerate. This research sheds light on the complex process of ovulation and its relation to fertility in rabbits.
