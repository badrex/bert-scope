tldr: 'Karl Jordan was a renowned entomologist and taxonomist who made significant contributions to the study of insects, particularly butterflies, moths, beetles, and fleas. He emphasized the importance of proper classification and the need for extensive collections and series to understand the relationships between species. Jordan's work laid the foundation for modern systematics and his concepts are still relevant today.'
