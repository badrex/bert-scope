tldr: This article discusses the unique properties of molecular composites, specifically organic-inorganic layer compounds. It explores the physical and chemical properties of layer perovskite halide salts, focusing on their magnetic properties, structural phase transitions, and potential for solid-state polymerization. The article highlights the potential of these compounds as models for two-dimensional cooperative magnetism and as templates for holding organic moieties in regular arrays for topochemical reactions.
