tldr: The authors investigated the surface micromorphology and ultrastructure of silicas extracted from different regions of the horsetail plant, Equisetum arvense. They found complex and varied ultrastructural motifs of silica, which varied with the anatomical region studied. The study discusses the importance of structure-function relationships, cell wall composition, and transpiration in the development of specific silicified structures in the plant.
