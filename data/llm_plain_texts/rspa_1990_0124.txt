tldr: The author presents an analytical method for the spiral Green function in acoustics and electromagnetism, which is useful in the theory of transonic acoustics and radiation. The study involves the field produced by a point source moving in a circle and reveals the geometry of surfaces of constant field strength, including the Mach surface for infinite field strength. The research has applications in supersonic generation of sound in acoustics and Cherenkov radiation in electromagnetism.
