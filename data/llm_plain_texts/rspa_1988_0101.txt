tldr: This study examines the effect of g-jitter, a fluctuating gravitational field, on heat transfer in a fluid medium in microgravity environments. The research focuses on a heated sphere and explores how the induced fluid flow affects heat transfer due to the fluctuating buoyancy force. The findings suggest that g-jitter can significantly modify the time-averaged heat transfer from the sphere, with implications for materials processing and solidification processes in space.
