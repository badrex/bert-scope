tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the conditions in which helium and associated gases exist in minerals. They found that certain minerals, like cleveite, can absorb and release helium under varying pressures. The study also showed that helium is absorbed less readily than hydrogen by metals like iron and palladium.
