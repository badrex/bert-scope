tldr: The authors developed a new method to study the use of chromatic signals in human vision by controlling luminance contrast. They found that chromatic signals are virtually unaffected by ongoing luminance contrast changes and are either processed independently or can be separated from luminance contrast components. The results suggest that chromatic signals are processed independently to generate perceived object color or construct spatially structured objects, involving different neural substrates. This helps explain why cerebral achromatopsia is a heterogeneous disorder and why there can be significant differences in the effective use of chromatic signals in affected individuals.
