tldr: This study investigates the relationship between stratigraphy and pollen content of lake deposits in the Lake District to reconstruct the history of deposition in relation to late- and post-glacial changes in climate and soil and vegetation in the drainage basins. Pollen analysis of six tarns highlights the contrast between regional changes due to climatic change and local changes due to topography and human history. The research aims to build a continuous ecological history of the lakes and their drainage basins by integrating data from pollen diagrams, soil changes, and chemical analyses.
