tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the influence of temperature on the pitch of harmonium reeds and tuning forks. They found that the pitch of harmonium reeds is affected in the same direction as tuning forks, with a very nearly twice the amount, that is, by about 1 in 10,000 vibrations for each degree Fahrenheit. This discovery is important for understanding and adjusting musical instruments in different temperature environments.
