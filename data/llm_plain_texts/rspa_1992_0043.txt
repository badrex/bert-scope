tldr: The authors study a special case of the fourth Painlevé equation and its solutions satisfying a boundary condition. They express these solutions in terms of solutions of linear integral equations from the inverse scattering formalism for the nonlinear Schrödinger equation. The authors obtain exact "bound state" solutions for positive integer values of a parameter, which decay exponentially and are the first example of such solutions for the Painlevé equations. They also derive a nonlinear recurrence relation for the equation relating two parameters.
