tldr: The article discusses electron paramagnetic resonance and optical studies of terbium in lanthanide nicotinate dihydrates. The ground state of terbium is found to be an almost degenerate doublet, and the optical absorption spectrum of terbium near 485 nm is analyzed. The temperature-independent magnetic susceptibility and the quadratic Zeeman effect in the low field limit are also studied, confirming a non-magnetic (singlet) ground state for terbium in this material.
