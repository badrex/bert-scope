tldr: The authors studied the crystalline fluorescence of 41 organic compounds, including 29 known carcinogens, when excited by 254 radiation. They observed different types of spectral patterns, ranging from type A with a vibrational structure similar to the parent compound to type D with a single broad, diffuse band and a major bathochromic shift. The authors attribute these differences to molecular interactions within the crystal. They also reported the molecular photofluorescence decay times of 32 of the compounds.
