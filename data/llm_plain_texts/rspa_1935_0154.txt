tldr: The authors studied the crystal structures of various alum compounds, discovering at least three different structures they named the a, p, and y structures. They found that the structure of a particular alum is dependent on the size of the monovalent ion. The research involved determining the electron density of the projections on (001) and analyzing oscillation photographs to estimate atomic positions and intensities.
