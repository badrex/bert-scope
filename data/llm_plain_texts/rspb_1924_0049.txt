revised_title: 'Anatomy and Function of Blood Glands in Pheretima Earthworms'
semantic_tags:
  - Earthworm anatomy
  - Blood-gland development
  - Oligochaeta
  - Earthworm physiology
  - Nephridial structures
tldr: The author examines the blood-glands in three species of Pheretima earthworms and describes their structure, location, and connection to blood vessels. The glands are found in the anterior part of the alimentary tube and are connected to the blood vessels, suggesting a possible role in the formation of blood corpuscles or waste extraction. The author also discusses the development of these glands and their relationship to other structures, such as nephridial tubules.
