tldr: This article explores the quantization of coupled orbits in metals, specifically focusing on a two-dimensional network and its application to the properties of zinc. The author develops a model to analyze the behavior of electrons in a magnetic field and investigates the consequences of magnetic breakdown. The results of the theory are applied to the observations of oscillatory behavior in zinc, providing a better understanding of its electronic structure, de Haas-van Alphen effect, and magneto-resistance.
