tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the properties of gastrotoxic serum, a serum that can cause damage to the stomach's tissues. They discovered that the serum contains multiple precipitins, each targeting specific proteins, and that these precipitins can cause necrotic patches and ulcers in the stomach. The author also found that repeated exposure to gastrotoxic serum can lead to immunity in animals, as their blood serum can protect against the toxic effects of the serum. This research sheds light on the complex nature of the gastrotoxic serum and its potential applications in understanding stomach ulcers and immunity.
