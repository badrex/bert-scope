tldr: This study examines the angular acceleration receptor system in 59 genera of cephalopods, focusing on the dimensions and volumes of their statocysts. The statocyst's size and structure vary among cephalopods, providing a range of sensitivity appropriate to their speed of locomotion. The research also discusses the importance of the cupula-kinociliary system in detecting angular velocity and the differences between cupulae in cephalopods and decapods.
