tldr: This study investigates the role of serum in the process of phagocytosis, which is the process by which cells called phagocytes engulf and destroy foreign substances such as bacteria. The author examines various theories and experiments conducted by other researchers, including the role of immune serum in stimulating or acting on phagocytes and microbes. The study concludes that there is a substance in the serum called "opsonin" that enhances the ability of phagocytes to engulf and destroy bacteria. This discovery has significant implications for understanding the immune system and developing treatments for infections.
