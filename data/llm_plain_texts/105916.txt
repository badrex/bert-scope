tldr: John Ellis describes a new genus of evergreen tree, Gordonia, which he discovered in America. He explains its unique characteristics, such as its flower structure and the way its petals and stamens are arranged. Ellis also discusses the differences between this new genus and other related plants, like Hibiscus and Hypericum, and proposes the name Gordonia in honor of his friend and fellow gardener, James Gordon.
