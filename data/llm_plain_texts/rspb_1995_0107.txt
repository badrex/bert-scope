tldr: This article corrects errors in a previous study about the effects of testosterone on red grouse breeding density, breeding success, and survival. The main conclusion that testosterone treatment affected population density remains unchanged, but some other findings are revised, such as the effect of year and the relationship between the probability of a cock leaving the study site and the number of implanted neighbors.
