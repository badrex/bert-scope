  - Metal Auger intensity ratios
tldr: The authors used Auger electron spectroscopy to study the surface oxidation states of transition metals, specifically nickel, iron, and copper. They found that the metal Auger intensity ratios can be used as a probe to determine the oxidation state of a metal, with the ratio decreasing as the oxidation state increases. This technique can be applied to investigate the surface oxidation of various metals.
