tldr: This study presents a model explaining the patterns of sandstone burial diagenesis in certain oil reservoirs, where petroleum migration and burial cementation occurred simultaneously. The rapid decline of porosity and permeability with depth in the Magnus Sandstone Member of the Magnus Oilfield, northern North Sea, is used as a type example of such a reservoir. The authors argue that burial cementation takes place at or below the oil-water contact, with little change to the bulk chemistry of the reservoir formation waters through time.
