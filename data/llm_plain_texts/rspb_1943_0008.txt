tldr: The article investigates the nervous system of the earthworm's alimentary canal and its control over gut movements. It discovers that the gut exhibits autonomous rhythmic movements, which are indirectly controlled by extrinsic nerves from the central nervous system. The study compares the earthworm's gut control with that of vertebrates and provides insights into the mechanisms of indirect control in annelids.
