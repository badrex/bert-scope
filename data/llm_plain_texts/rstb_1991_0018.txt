tldr: This article discusses the formation of the blastema, a growth zone responsible for limb regeneration in urodele amphibians. It explores the origin of blastemal cells and their positional identity along the proximodistal axis. The article also highlights the role of retinoic acid in resetting axial specification and its potential as an endogenous morphogen in limb regeneration.
