tldr: The article describes the isolation and characterization of a replication-competent holoenzyme form of mammalian DNA polymerase α from calf thymus. This holoenzyme consists of a polymerase-primase core and at least six other polypeptides, and can efficiently replicate several naturally occurring templates, including porcine circovirus DNA. The study provides insights into the replication mechanisms of eukaryotic chromosomes and the role of DNA polymerase α in the process.
