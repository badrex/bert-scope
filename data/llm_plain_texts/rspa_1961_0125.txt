tldr: The authors studied electron energy distributions in the cathode regions of helium, neon, and argon plasmas. They discovered two distinct groups of electrons in the striated column: primary electrons with higher energy and secondary electrons with lower energy. The concentration of both groups decreases towards the anode end of the striation. The authors found that a uniform electric field cannot maintain the discharge when primary electrons are exhausted, and a striated column will exist until a mechanism for modifying the energy distribution is present. Measurements in argon showed different characteristics, with a stronger but decreasing electric field and a higher ratio of primary electron concentration to total electron concentration.
