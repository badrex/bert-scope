tldr: This article presents measurements of the penetration of magnetic fields into superconducting tin and mercury using the Casimir method. The results show that the penetration depth is sensitive to surface conditions, and the anisotropy in the penetration depth for current flow in different crystal directions is found to be minimal. The study also finds no significant dependence of the penetration depth on a steady magnetic field.
