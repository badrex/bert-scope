tldr: The article discusses the challenges of purifying proteins in large-scale biochemical processing. It examines the effects of mechanical forces on proteins and their complexes, the order of isolation procedures, and the selective removal of non-proteinaceous materials. The paper also explores the use of recombinant DNA techniques for large-scale synthesis of human proteins and the importance of on-line process optimization during pilot plant trials.
