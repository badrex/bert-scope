tldr: The author conducted a series of observations on the motions of gaseous nebulae using a spectroscope. They found that none of the observed nebulae showed a motion of translation greater than 25 miles per second, including the Earth's motion. The study suggests that gaseous nebulae as a class do not have proper motions as great as bright stars. The observations also provide insights into the possible types of motion within nebulae and their relation to the Milky Way and the sidereal system.
