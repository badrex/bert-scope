tldr: The authors develop a general theory for mean first-passage times of Brownian motion and related problems. They show that for specific boundaries, mean first-passage times can be derived easily and have a close analytical relationship to the well-known formulae for average intervals. The authors also provide new formulae for translational Brownian motion and discuss special cases with external forces.
