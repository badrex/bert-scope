tldr: 'The author conducted a genetic and taxonomic investigation of the genus Oenothera, focusing on the Onagra section. They collected seeds from various locations in North America and grew them in a laboratory. By studying the variations and mutations in these plants, the author discovered the importance of chromosome catenation in the evolution of the genus Oenothera. This research also revealed the potential impact of human activities on the distribution and spread of these plants.'
