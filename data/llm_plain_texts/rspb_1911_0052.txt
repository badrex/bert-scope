tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the initial stages of photosynthesis, specifically the formation of primary photolytic products from carbon dioxide and the evolution of oxygen. They found that aqueous carbon dioxide can be decomposed by light, producing hydrogen peroxide and formaldehyde. These findings support the belief that both formaldehyde and hydrogen peroxide are formed in green leaves during photosynthesis.
