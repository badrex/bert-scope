tldr: This article discusses the use of genetics to analyze bacterial virulence and understand the roles of specific microbial products in disease production. The author covers various areas, including the use of mutations, extrachromosomal elements, and high-frequency variations in cell-surface structure. Genetic approaches have improved our understanding of bacterial pathogens and contributed to the development of new vaccines.
