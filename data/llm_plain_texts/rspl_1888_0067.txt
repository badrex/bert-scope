revised_title: Reconciling Meteoric and Nebular Theories of Cosmogony
semantic_tags:
  - Cosmogony
  - Meteorites
  - Nebular Hypothesis
  - Fluid Pressure
  - Kinetic Theory
tldr: This article suggests that the fluid pressure in the nebular hypothesis can be explained as the result of countless impacts of meteorites. The author proposes that the kinetic theory of gases can be applied to meteorites, allowing for a better understanding of their behavior and the formation of planetary systems.
