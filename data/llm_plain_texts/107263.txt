tldr: The author presents a method for examining and measuring the divisions of astronomical instruments to ensure their accuracy. The process involves comparing the intervals between different arcs on the instrument and noting down any differences. This method allows for the determination of the absolute length of the arcs and helps in minimizing errors in measurements.
