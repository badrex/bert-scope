tldr: This article presents a formalism for calculating high coefficients of the Weyl expansion for the trace of the resolvent of the Laplace operator in a domain with smooth boundaries. The authors test conjectures related to the resurgence of periodic orbits and the Stokes phenomenon in quantum billiards, using examples such as the harmonic oscillator, particle on a ring, and billiards on a compact surface with constant negative curvature. The results confirm the divergence of the Weyl series and the role of periodic orbits in the behavior of quantum systems.
