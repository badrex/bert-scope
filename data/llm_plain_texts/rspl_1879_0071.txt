tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the thermo-electric behavior of aqueous solutions using mercurial electrodes. They found that the solutions exhibited different behaviors and currents when heated or cooled, and the direction of the current was influenced by the temperature. The results showed that the cause of the currents and their direction were similar in both the present research and a previous study on thermo-electric properties of liquids.
