tldr: This article discusses the impact of the terrane hypothesis on geological thinking and its geophysically testable predictions. It highlights the importance of palaeomagnetic studies and the role of strike-slip movements in the British Caledonides. The authors also mention the need for further research to better understand the rotation of terranes and their implications.
