tldr: The authors used an atmospheric general circulation model to simulate the Southern Oscillation, a key component of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon. The model was forced with observed sea surface temperature patterns from 1970 to 1985. The study found that the model successfully reproduced the warm events of 1972-73 and 1982-83 and the cold event of 1970-71, but failed to capture the cold events of 1973-74 and 1975-76 and the warm event of 1976-77. The study highlights the need for more accurate modeling to better understand and predict ENSO events.
