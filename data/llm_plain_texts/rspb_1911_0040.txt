tldr: This study investigates the phenomenon of gametic coupling in peas, specifically the relationship between tendrilled plants and round seed varieties. The researchers found a unique gametic system of 63:1, which affects the zygotic ratio of the plants. This discovery sheds light on the understanding of heredity and plant breeding in peas.
