tldr: 'The author conducted experiments on thermal transpiration of gases through porous plates, studying the laws of transpiration and impulsion. The research extends the dynamical theory of gases, considering the stresses and tangential forces caused by varying gas conditions, and provides an explanation for the phenomena of transpiration and impulsion.'
