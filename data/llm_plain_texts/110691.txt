tldr: Luke Howard's study of the lunar apsides' influence on atmospheric conditions in London reveals that the moon's perigee brings a southern atmosphere, lowering air density, raising temperature, and increasing precipitation. In contrast, the apogee allows a freer influx of air from the north, resulting in higher barometer readings, lower temperatures, and less rain. However, there are exceptions with increased rain during specific apsides.
