tldr: Arthur Cayley's research focuses on the partition of numbers, specifically finding ways to represent a number 'q' using elements 'a', 'b', 'c', etc., with no limit on their repetition. He uses algebraic fractions and prime circulators to express the analytical form of the number of partitions and determine the coefficients.
