tldr: 'Lieutenant Henry Foster conducted a series of observations on the daily variation of the magnetic needle at the Whale Fish Islands. Although the brass work of the instrument was later found to be magnetic, these observations indicated the possible agency of the sun in producing the daily variation. Further, more extended and exact observations were made at Port Bowen by Captain Parry and others.'
