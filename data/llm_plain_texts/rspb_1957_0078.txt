tldr: The authors discuss the use of diathermy apparatus for rapidly rewarming whole animals from 0°C and below. They describe an oscillator-based method that uses induced currents to heat the animal, and explain the challenges of applying this method to larger animals. The authors also acknowledge the help of colleagues in the design and construction of the apparatus.
