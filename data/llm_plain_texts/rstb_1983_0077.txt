tldr: This study investigates the role of airborne contamination in sepsis after total hip or knee joint replacement surgeries. The research found that over 90% of bacterial contamination of the wound comes from the air, and cleaner air results in a lower risk of sepsis. The majority of infections are associated with bacterial species commonly found on the skin, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus albus. The study suggests that reducing airborne contamination in the operating room can help prevent infection in these types of surgeries.
