tldr: This study investigates the complexity and chaos in measles dynamics, analyzing transmission patterns and exploring the impact of various factors on the disease's spread. The authors use mathematical models, including the SEIR model, to generate data and compare it with observed measles time series. They find that demographic noise and other factors can affect the dynamics, but the underlying mechanisms behind longer-term cycles remain unclear.
