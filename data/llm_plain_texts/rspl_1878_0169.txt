tldr: The author investigates the phenomenon of dynamic electricity produced by immersing unequally-heated metals in liquids. They find that an upward or downward current of electricity is generated depending on the liquid's acidity or alkalinity. The author also notes that these currents do not appear to arise from heat or other forces within the liquid mass.
