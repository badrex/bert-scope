tldr: Researchers studied the process of carbon formation in diffusion flames using various hydrocarbon fuels. They found that although acetylene was present in the flames, it was unlikely to be the essential intermediate in carbon formation. The study aimed to understand the mechanisms behind carbon deposits in engines and gas turbines, as well as the manufacturing of carbon black.
