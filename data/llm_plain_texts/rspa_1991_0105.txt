tldr: This article investigates the resonant oscillations produced in a gas contained in a vibrating spherical shell. The approach used is different from the one for plane waves, resulting in three major differences: larger amplitude oscillations, non-unique solutions, and the absence of shock waves. The study assumes a solution for the gas pressure in the form of a small factor and uses a perturbation of the linear approximation to analyze the problem. The results show non-uniqueness and a significant increase in amplitude for oscillations near resonance.
