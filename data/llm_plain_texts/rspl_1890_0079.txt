tldr: The author conducted experiments on animals to study the effects of asphyxia and the anaesthetic action of pure nitrogen on the pulmonary circulation. They found that the immediate cause of death in cases of asphyxia is the arrest of the pulmonary circulation, which is influenced by the contraction of pulmonary arterioles. The author also discovered that the arrest of circulation is not due to paralysis of the heart's walls but rather the inability of the right heart cavities to empty themselves. This research provides additional evidence supporting the theory that the arrest of the pulmonary circulation is the primary cause of death in asphyxia cases.
