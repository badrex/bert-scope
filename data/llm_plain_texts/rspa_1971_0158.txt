tldr: This study investigates the formation and reactions of radicals in frozen aqueous glasses containing thymidine, using electron spin resonance spectroscopy. The results show that electron reactions with thymidine produce anions, which protonate to form 6-thymyl radicals during thermal or ultraviolet bleaching. The findings support the proposed mechanism of 6-thymyl radical formation through protonation of an intermediate anionic species, the thymine anion.
