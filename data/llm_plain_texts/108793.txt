tldr: The author investigates the reason behind the stomach's immunity from being digested by its own secretion during life. They refute the theories of the "living principle" and the protective role of the epithelial lining. Instead, they propose that the circulation of alkaline blood within the stomach walls neutralizes the acidity of the gastric juice, preventing the stomach from being digested.
