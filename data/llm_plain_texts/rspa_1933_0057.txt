tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the photosynthesis of hydrogen chloride in oxygen-free mixtures. They discovered that the reaction's rate is proportional to the square root of the light intensity and is inhibited by chlorine and hydrogen chloride. The results support the mechanism of the reaction proposed by Christiansen, Polanyi, and Herzfeld, which is similar to the hydrogen-bromine reaction.
