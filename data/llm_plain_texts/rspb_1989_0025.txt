tldr: 'This study investigates the effect of external nutrient resources, such as ammonium and phosphate, on the population dynamics of zooxanthellae in the reef coral Stylophora pistillata. The results show that corals treated with ammonium had a significant increase in zooxanthellae density, suggesting that the growth of zooxanthellae in these corals is nitrogen-limited.'
