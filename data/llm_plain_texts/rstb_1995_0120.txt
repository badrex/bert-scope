tldr: The article discusses the hypothesis that the evolution of sexual differentiation is a result of selection on nuclear genes to coordinate the inheritance of cytoplasmic genomes and limit competition between unrelated cytoplasmic genomes. Selfish genetic elements, such as ultracompetitive alleles and their suppressors, play a significant role in this process. The article presents evidence supporting this hypothesis and its implications for the evolution of mating types and sexual reproduction.
