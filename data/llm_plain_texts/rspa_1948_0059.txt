tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the reaction zone of a Bunsen flame using a low-pressure flame, which allowed them to make direct measurements in the reaction zone. They studied the behavior of an acetylene-oxygen and acetylene-air flame at low pressure and found that the separation between the Schlieren image and the luminous cone is a property common to all hydrocarbon flames, indicating that a rapid temperature rise begins before luminosity arises. The authors also measured the temperature gradient in the low-pressure flame and discussed the influence of the thermocouple on the flame's shape.
