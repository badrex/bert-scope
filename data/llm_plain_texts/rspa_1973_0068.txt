tldr: The authors analyzed the intermolecular mode dispersion curves of deuterated hexamethylenetetramine (DHMT) using a new interatomic lattice dynamical model. They found that the dominant bond in DHMT is the shortest D bond, and the 'rigid molecule' approximation is indicated to be of doubtful validity for most molecules. The study suggests an approximate procedure to retain this approximation in analyzing external mode dispersion curves.
