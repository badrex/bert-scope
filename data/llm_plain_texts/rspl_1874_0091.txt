tldr: The author conducted experiments on severed brains of humans and higher vertebrates to study the proportions of the lobes and the causes of asymmetry in the cerebral convolutions. They found that the increase in brain weight is not proportional to the increase in stature, and that shorter individuals have a larger amount of brain relative to their height. The author also observed stronger evidence of essential asymmetry in the neighborhood of the left fissure of Rolando and the right parietal lobule.
