tldr: The authors present a method for inferring single ion channel data using Poisson sampling. They demonstrate that the Poisson sampling-based estimates converge to maximum-likelihood estimates from actual sojourn times. The method can be applied to various ion channel data and is useful for understanding channel gating mechanisms.
