tldr: The authors present a method for measuring the internal resistance of a multiple battery by adjusting the galvanometer to zero. The method involves connecting a shunt to the battery poles and adjusting the resistance until the galvanometer reading is zero. This technique is useful for testing several cells in a battery.
