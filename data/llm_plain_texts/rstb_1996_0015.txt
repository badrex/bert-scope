tldr: 'The article discusses the importance of IRS-proteins in the insulin and cytokine signalling pathways. These proteins act as an interface between receptors and signalling proteins containing Src homology-2 domains, providing signal amplification and dissociating the intracellular signalling complex from the endocytic pathways of the activated receptor. The shared use of IRS-proteins by multiple receptors reveals connections between various hormones and cytokines, leading to a better understanding of their roles in cellular processes.'
