tldr: The authors describe two morphologically distinct types of horizontal cells in the cat retina, referred to as A-type and B-type cells. They differ in their dendritic branching patterns, overall size, and the presence or absence of an axon. The study uses Golgi-stained whole mounts of the cat retina to provide a qualitative description of these cells, which serves as a foundation for subsequent quantitative studies.
