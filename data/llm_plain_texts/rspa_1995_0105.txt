tldr: The author presents fourth-order bounds on the effective bulk and shear moduli of two-component materials with well-ordered phases and homogeneous, isotropic elastic properties. The study focuses on random dispersions of penetrable spheres, a model with known three- and four-point correlation functions. The structural parameters entering the fourth-order bounds are expressed in terms of integrals over these correlation functions, allowing for numerical calculations and comparison with estimates from the differential effective medium theory.
