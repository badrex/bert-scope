tldr: In 1668, M. Jean Denis, a physician and professor of mathematics in Paris, wrote a letter addressing the controversies surrounding blood transfusion. He shared his experiences with the procedure, including the successful treatment of a madman using calf's blood transfusion. However, his work faced opposition from envious spirits and even the patient's wife, who accused Denis and his colleagues of causing the patient's death. Despite the challenges, Denis stood firm in his belief that blood transfusion could be a valuable medical tool when used appropriately.
