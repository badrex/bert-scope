tldr: The author, J. W. Hulke, examines the unique structure of the Chameleon's retina, specifically the fovea and pecten. He describes the arrangement of the fibres in the retina and their connection to the optic nerve. The Chameleon's retina is similar to the human eye's yellow spot in terms of the distribution of optic nerve fibres. This research provides insight into the Chameleon's vision and the function of its retina.
