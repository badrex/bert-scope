tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the refractive index and dispersion of gaseous heavy water, comparing it to normal water vapor. They found that the refractive index of heavy water is slightly lower than that of normal water, and its dispersion curve is flatter. This confirms previous findings in liquid form.
