tldr: This study presents a comprehensive monograph of the Chrysobalanaceae plant family, examining its rank, circumscription, and relationships to other families. The authors attempt to provide an objective and repeatable taxonomy and formulate evolutionary hypotheses consistent with the facts presented. They also evaluate the practical value of various taxonomic information sources, such as electron microscopy and phytochemical analysis. The monograph tests the application of numerical taxonomy, cladistics, and vicariance biogeography in a worldwide monograph for the first time. The study concludes that while some currently popular approaches to taxonomy may be of limited relevance, it is essential to develop objective methods of visual analysis and understand the central role of ecology in biology.
