tldr: This study investigates the microstructure and irradiation effects on a 12% Cr ferritic steel, analyzing its resistance to void swelling. Transmission electron microscopy is used to examine the microstructural features and dislocation loops in the steel after fast reactor irradiation. The results show that the steel's swelling resistance is due to the relative rates of nucleation and growth of interstitial dislocation loops, which suppress void nucleation and growth. The study also compares the microstructure of the steel to that of pure iron under similar irradiation conditions.
