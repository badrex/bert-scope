tldr: This study examines the Pleistocene stratigraphy and palaeobotany of the Isles of Scilly, providing a detailed chronology and palaeoenvironmental reconstruction. The researchers define eight lithostratigraphic units and two lithostratigraphic models for the northern and southern Scillies. Radiocarbon, optical, and thermoluminescence dating techniques are used to date the organic sequences and glacial events, revealing the glacial history of the region.
