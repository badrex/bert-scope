tldr: The authors study the geological evolution of the Tibetan Plateau, focusing on the Cenozoic uplift and deformation. They identify a widespread erosion surface, known as a pediplain, which has been cut across various rock types and folded layers. This surface provides constraints on the tectonic evolution of the plateau, suggesting that the crust beneath the plateau was thickened mainly before the pediplanation.
