tldr: The author conducted experiments on the elasticity of metal wires, specifically iron, to understand the effects of long-term stress on their strength. They discovered that slow and continuous stress application can actually strengthen the wire, which could help correct misconceptions about the dangers of applying heavy loads to iron structures like steam boilers. The study also found that wires broken slowly had less elongation than those broken quickly.
