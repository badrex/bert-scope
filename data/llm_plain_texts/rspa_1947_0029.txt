tldr: The authors explore the limitations of the Newtonian time scale in understanding non-equilibrium rheological states and introduce fractional differential equations to describe the behavior of complex materials. They test their theory on thirty-eight materials and find that introducing a term from the series equation significantly improves the fit for materials that do not follow Nutting's equation. The authors propose that the relative importance of the second term in the series equation may reveal the presence of undissipated stresses in materials.
