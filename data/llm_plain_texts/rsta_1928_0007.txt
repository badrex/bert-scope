tldr: The authors conducted a precise measurement to determine the ratio of the standard yard to the international prototype metre using a subsidiary line standard. They calibrated the main intervals and compared them with the Imperial Standard Yard and the International Prototype Metre. The result of their work provided a highly accurate ratio of 1 metre to 39.3701 inches.
