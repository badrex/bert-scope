tldr: The authors studied the enzyme action in Phaseolus lunatus and almond emulsin, discovering that the enzyme in Phaseolus lunatus seeds contains both emulsin-type and maltase-type enzymes. They found that the enzyme in Phaseolus lunatus seeds hydrolyzes a-glucosides, contrary to previous beliefs that it hydrolyzed b-glucosides. This research helps to clarify the understanding of enzyme action and the differences between various enzymes.
