tldr: This article investigates the pressure exerted on the poles of an electric arc, both in alternating and direct currents. The authors describe various experimental methods to measure this pressure and discuss its origin. They find that the pressure is greater for smaller arc lengths and that the anode pressure tends to be higher for longer arcs. The study provides valuable insights into the behavior of electric arcs and their applications.
