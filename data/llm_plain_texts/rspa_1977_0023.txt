reexpressed in the coordinate system containing the axis. The transformation of the nuclear spin operators is achieved by using the Wigner rotation matrix,, where is the Euler angle between the director and the magnetic field coordinate systems. The transformed hyperfine interaction is then given by, ( 15 ) where the transformed hyperfine tensor is defined by. ( 16 ) The transformed hyperfine interaction is now incorporated into the dynamic spin hamiltonian,, ( 17 ) where the transformed Zeeman interaction is given by. ( 18 ) The relaxation matrix is now calculated from the dynamic spin hamiltonian using Redfield's theory ( 1965 ). The resulting matrix elements are then used to calculate the linewidths of the spectrum. The angular dependence of the linewidths is determined by the orientation of the sample with respect to the magnetic field and is given by. ( 19 ) The linewidth theory needed to interpret this angular dependence for doublet-state spin probes has evolved ( Luckhurst \amp ; Sanson 1972 ; Hemminga \amp ; Berendsen 1972 ; Schindler \amp ; Seelig 1973 ; Luckhurst, Setaka \amp ; Zannoni 1974 ) since the pioneering work of McFarland \amp ; McConnell in 1971. These theories have then been used to determine rotational correlation times, as well as a novel order parameter, in nematics ( Luckhurst \amp ; Poupko 1974 ; Luckhurst \amp ; Yeates 1976 ) and membranes ( Hemminga 1974 ; Schindler \amp ; Seelig 1974 ). However, the various theories employed in these determinations all assume that both the electron and nuclear spins are quantized along the applied magnetic field, irrespective of the sample orientation. This is likely to be a good approximation for the electron spin but may not be appropriate for the nuclear spin because of the important pseudo-secular hyperfine terms in the static spin hamiltonian. The influence of spin quantization on line broadening was appreciated in the earliest theoretical development ( McFarland \amp ; McConnell 1971 ) but its effect on the parameters determined from linewidth studies has not been estimated. In this paper, we remove the common assumption concerning quantization of the nuclear spin and use the resulting theory to gauge the importance of this approximation. We begin, in the next section, with a brief derivation of the static spin hamiltonian and show how it is employed to determine the line positions.
