tldr: The author, A.W. Hofmann, investigates the formation and properties of diatomic ammonias through the reaction of dibromide of ethylene with ammonia. He discusses the controversy with M. Cloez regarding the correct formulae for these compounds and provides experimental evidence to support his diatomic theory. Hofmann's research contributes to the understanding of the chemical properties and reactions of nitrogen compounds.
