tldr: This study examines how children learning English and Korean express meanings related to directed motion according to language-specific principles of semantic and grammatical structuring from the earliest stages of word combination. It challenges the idea that children's initial step in grammar construction is to discover patterns for positioning words that instantiate relational concepts learned independently of language. Instead, it argues that meaning as it is expressed in children's early sentences is, from the beginning, organized on the basis of experience with the grammar and lexicon of a particular language.
