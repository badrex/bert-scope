revised_title: Laplace's Equation and Surfaces of Revolution
semantic_tags:
  - Partial Differential Equations
  - Laplace's Equation
  - Surfaces of Revolution
  - Inversion Theory
  - Potential Theory
tldr: The authors explore Laplace's equation and its applications to surfaces of revolution, focusing on the concept of inversion. They demonstrate how various types of surfaces, such as spheres, spheroids, and paraboloids, can be used to solve problems related to potential functions and partial differential equations.
