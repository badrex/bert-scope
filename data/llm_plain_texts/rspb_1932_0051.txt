revised_title: 'Comparing the Buffering Powers and Equivalent of Serum Albumin and Ovalbumin'
semantic_tags:
  - Protein chemistry
  - Buffering power
  - Acid-base titration
  - Serum albumin
  - Ovalbumin
tldr: This article compares the buffering powers and equivalent of serum albumin and ovalbumin. It discusses their acid-base titration, combination curves, and the effects of heat on their properties. The results show that serum albumin has a higher buffering power and a more stable structure in the presence of alkali, making it a more robust protein.
