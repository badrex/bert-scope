tldr: This article explores the relationship between incompressible and compressible boundary layers in fluid dynamics. The author transforms the boundary-layer equations for a compressible fluid, assuming certain conditions, and shows that results from incompressible boundary layer theory can be applied to compressible ones. The study also investigates the effects of compressibility and viscosity on boundary layers and provides methods for solving problems in compressible fluid dynamics using incompressible flow solutions.
