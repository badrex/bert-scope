tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand how the Actiniae, a type of sea anemone, kills its prey. They discovered that the sea anemone uses a potent, acrid irritant poison similar to that of wasps or snakes, which spreads through the prey's system, causing writhing, paralysis, and eventually death. The poison darts are not capable of penetrating deep into the prey's body, which explains the limited damage caused by the Actiniae.
