tldr: The authors analyze the spectrum of x Centauri and find that many of its bright lines closely correspond to the enhanced lines of iron in a Cygni stars. They also observe similarities between the bright lines in x Centauri's spectrum and those in the early stages of Novae. This study contributes to the understanding of the chemical composition of stars and their spectra.
