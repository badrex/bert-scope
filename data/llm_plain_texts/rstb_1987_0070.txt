tldr: The article discusses the replication of adenovirus and SV40 chromosomes in vitro, focusing on the proteins required for the initiation of DNA synthesis. The adenovirus origin of replication consists of three functionally distinct sequence domains, and cellular proteins that specifically recognize these domains were purified and characterized. In SV40 replication, the first step involves the specific binding of T antigen to the origin, followed by the local unwinding of the DNA template. This unwinding reaction requires ATP hydrolysis and a cellular factor that can be replaced by the single-stranded DNA binding protein of Escherichia coli. The study provides insights into the mechanisms involved in eukaryotic chromosome replication.
