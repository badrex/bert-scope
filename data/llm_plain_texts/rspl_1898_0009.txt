tldr: This article presents experiments conducted on the magnetic deformation of nickel under varying temperatures. The author found that the magnetic contraction of nickel is influenced by temperature, with an increase in contraction at low fields and a decrease at higher fields. The results also showed that the magnetic behavior of the nickel wire changes over time, with the magnetization and contraction curves differing between measurements taken in November and January.
