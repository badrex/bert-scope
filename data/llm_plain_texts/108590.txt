tldr: The author presents a detailed analysis of the larger magnetic disturbances observed at Toronto over five years. They describe the process of collecting and correcting hourly observations of the horizontal and vertical magnetic forces, and discuss the periodical laws that govern these disturbances. The study also includes an examination of the disturbances of the inclination and total force, and a revision of the analysis of the larger disturbances of the declination. This work contributes to the understanding of Earth's magnetic field and its variations.
