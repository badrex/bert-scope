tldr: The authors developed a new method called the porometer to measure the aperture of stomata in living plants. The porometer records the change in air velocity through the stomata, allowing for a more accurate estimation of stomatal aperture and its relationship with transpiration. This method provides a more precise and continuous measurement compared to previous methods, such as the cobalt test and horn hygroscope.
