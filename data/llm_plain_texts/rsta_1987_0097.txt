tldr: This article discusses the vast scientific campaign associated with the 1986 return of Halley's Comet, which greatly improved and expanded our knowledge of comets. It covers the large-scale structure, chemistry, and nucleus of the comet, confirming Biermann and Alfven's basic picture involving the interaction with the solar wind. The cometary environment is a rich plasma physics laboratory and the site of spectacular disconnection events. The chemical composition of the nucleus is largely water, and the breakup of the water molecule produces the large hydrogen cloud surrounding the comet. The composition of the dust generally resembles carbonaceous chondrites enriched in elements and O. The interest in cometary chemistry stems from the belief that cometary material is probably the best remnant of the solar nebula's original composition. The nucleus is monolithic, irregular, and peanut- or potato-shaped, with a very dark surface where gas and dust emission occurs in jets on the sunward side.
