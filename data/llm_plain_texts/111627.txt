tldr: The author conducted experiments on tendon repair after subcutaneous division and found that reunion is possible when the divided ends are held in apposition and the limb is kept at rest. The new material becomes organized and persists as a permanent structure when extension is made. This process is explained, and the appearances presented by the tendon in various stages of reunion are detailed and illustrated by colored drawings.
