tldr: Joule and Thomson conducted experiments to study the thermal effects of fluids in motion and the temperature of bodies moving in air. They found that the thermal effect is proportional to the square of the velocity and that fluid friction plays a significant role in the motion of bodies. Their work contributed to the understanding of the Joule-Thomson effect and the behavior of fluids in various conditions.
