tldr: The authors investigate the stability of forced steady solitary waves using the forced Korteweg-de Vries (fKdV) model. They analyze two primary flows and their stability, identifying three categories of evolution for infinitesimal disturbances. The study provides insights into the mechanism of periodical production of upstream-advancing waves and confirms the predictions obtained analytically for various regimes through numerical simulations.
