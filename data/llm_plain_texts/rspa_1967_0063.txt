tldr: This article investigates the optical properties of arsenic trisulphide crystals, including their absorption spectra, refractive indices, and birefringence. The authors determine the dispersion of the ordinary and extraordinary refractive indices and the optic axial angle, as well as the absorption bands and their corresponding wavelengths. Their findings contribute to the understanding of the material's optical properties and potential applications.
