tldr: This article argues that the lack of evolutionary change in most species may be due to a limited supply of genetic variation, rather than other factors. The author proposes the term "genostasis" to describe this condition and suggests that paying more attention to the mechanisms of supplying new genetic variation and understanding situations where evolution appears to be absent is crucial for a better understanding of the evolutionary process.
