tldr: This study investigates the specific heat and thermal properties of pure iron using an electrical method. The specific heat rises from 50°C to the magnetic point, with a peak at 755°C. The study also reveals an increased absorption of heat in the range of 120 to 280°C. The thermal capacity of pure iron is determined through a series of experiments, providing valuable insights into iron's properties and potential applications.
