tldr: Mons. Bonnet reports the success of smallpox inoculation in Geneva, mentioning that out of 70 people inoculated, none were in danger. He also mentions that Lausanne has adopted the practice and hopes it will spread for the good of mankind. However, he believes it may take time for the French to adopt the practice due to opposition from the clergy.
