tldr: The author discusses the effect of westerly winds on the level of the British Channel and the dangers it poses to navigation. He explains that during the prevalence of westerly winds, the height of the tides is greater in the southern parts of Great Britain, and a current overcomes the ebb-tide. This can lead to unexpected dangers for ships navigating the area, as demonstrated by the loss of the Britannia East Indiaman.
