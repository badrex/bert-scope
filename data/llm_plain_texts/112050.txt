tldr: The author investigates the isomerism between chinoline and leukoline series of alkaloids, focusing on the differences between lutidine and 3-lutidine. They compare their physical properties, reactions, and the formation of platinum salts to understand the isomeric relationship. The study contributes to the understanding of isomerism in organic chemistry, specifically in the context of alkaloids.
