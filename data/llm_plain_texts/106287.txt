tldr: In 1775, Tiberius Cavallo conducted an experiment using an electrical kite to study atmospheric electricity. He discovered that the electricity changed from positive to negative as a cloud approached, and received several shocks when connecting the kite string to a chair. This experiment demonstrated the connection between atmospheric conditions and electricity, and the potential dangers of accumulated electrical charge.
