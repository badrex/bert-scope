tldr: 'The author describes dynamic polarization work at A.E.R.E., Harwell, focusing on proton-proton scattering and target polarization. They explain how the Harwell synchrocyclotron provides two proton beams for energy measurements and discuss the process of obtaining polarization and spin-correlation parameters. The author also mentions the use of La2 (l%146Nd)Mg3 (N03)12.24H20 as a target and irradiation with microwaves to measure target polarization. They highlight the challenges of target heating and paramagnetic damage centers affecting the results.'
