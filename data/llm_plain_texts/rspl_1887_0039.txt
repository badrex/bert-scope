tldr: The author presents a new instrument called the "Radio-micrometer" for measuring feeble radiation. The instrument is more sensitive than the thermopile and bolometer, and it has potential applications in spectroscopic work. The author discusses the design, materials, and principles behind the Radio-micrometer, as well as its advantages and limitations.
