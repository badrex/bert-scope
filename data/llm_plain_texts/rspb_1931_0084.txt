tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the transmission of radiation through the horny layer of human skin. They used monochromators to obtain pure, monochromatic radiations and employed two methods to overcome the issue of scattering in the non-homogeneous medium. The results showed lower percentage transmissions and a sudden drop in transmission with decreasing wavelength, highlighting the importance of considering scattering effects in radiation measurements.
