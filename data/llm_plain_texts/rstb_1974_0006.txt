tldr: This study examines the late Quaternary history of vegetation and climate in the Rajasthan Desert, India, through the analysis of pollen and radiocarbon dating from four lake profiles and archaeological soil samples. The research reveals a series of environmental phases, with vegetation and climate changes influenced by natural and human factors. The results suggest that the Rajasthan desert is primarily a natural formation, with a history of humid periods during the Holocene.
