tldr: The authors conducted tensile tests on crystals of an aluminum-zinc alloy to study its mechanical properties. They found that the addition of 18% zinc to aluminum increases the material's hardness and reduces the amount of slip that can occur before fracture. The orientation of the crystal relative to the test piece affects the breaking stress and the type of fracture. Fracture occurs on planes nearly at 45 degrees to the axis, and the tenacity of single crystals appears to be higher than that of polycrystalline material.
