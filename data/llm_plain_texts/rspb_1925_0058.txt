tldr: The authors compared the antigenic properties of sensitised and raw pneumococcal vaccines to determine the influence of sensitisation. They found that sensitised vaccines have an immediate but brief immunising effect, while raw vaccines confer a more prolonged immunity. The study also showed that sensitised vaccines have reduced antigenic power compared to raw vaccines, and that a small fraction of antibodies in a sensitised pneumococcal vaccine remains firmly combined.
