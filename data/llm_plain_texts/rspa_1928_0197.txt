tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of adding various substances on the fluorescence of substances in aqueous solutions. They found that salts with more deformable ions were more effective at extinguishing fluorescence, suggesting that energy lost by excited fluorescent molecules is used to create a deformation or polarization in the ion. This study also explored the potential for non-fluorescent molecules to be more efficient photosensitizers than fluorescent ones.
