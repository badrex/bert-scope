tldr: This article presents a preliminary notice and theoretical analysis of dynamo-electric machines. The authors explore the relationship between magnetic fields, magnetizing forces, and electromotive force in dynamo machines. They also discuss the effects of current in the armature and the influence of brush lead on the machine's performance. The authors provide a formula for constructing the characteristic curve of a dynamo and demonstrate its application through experiments.
