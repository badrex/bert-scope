tldr: The authors present an analytical solution for steady, two-dimensional supersonic flow of a perfect gas. They reduce the equations of motion to linear hyperbolic differential equations and use Riemann's method and double power series to solve them. The solution is applicable to various boundary conditions, including those involving floating boundaries in the hodograph plane. This method can be extended to more complicated problems, such as steady supersonic axially symmetrical flow and spherical waves of finite amplitude.
