tldr: This article discusses the mechanism of complement cytolysis and the concept of channel-forming proteins, focusing on the C5b-9(m) complement complex. The authors explain how these proteins damage membranes by forming transmembrane pores and describe the self-association and amphiphilic transition of the proteins. They also compare the C5b-9(m) complex to other channel-forming proteins, such as Staphylococcus aureus a-toxin and streptolysin-O.
