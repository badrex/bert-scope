tldr: 'Dr. Herschel observed the celestial bodies Ceres and Pallas, discovered by Piazzi and Olbers. He determined their sizes, colors, and atmospheres, and investigated whether they were planets or comets. Based on his observations, Herschel concluded that these bodies did not fit the criteria for planets or comets and proposed a new term for them: "celestial bodies of a small or very small size."'
