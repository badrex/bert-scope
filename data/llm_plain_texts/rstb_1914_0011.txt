tldr: The author conducted experiments on nerve anastomosis in limb muscles, focusing on the restoration of paralyzed muscles by connecting different nerves. They found that recovery of function occurred in the crossed nerves, and discussed the factors affecting the date of recovery and the theories behind the restoration of coordinated movements.
