tldr: In 1702, Jonathan Kay shared the story of his father's rare cancer case. The cancer started as a small bruise on the Os Fugale and spread to various parts of the face, eventually leading to the exposure of the brain. Despite the efforts of several prominent surgeons, the father passed away due to the progression of the cancer. This case study provides insight into early modern medicine and cancer treatment.
