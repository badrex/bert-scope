tldr: This article explores the effects of covalent bonding on X-ray scattering in germanium, comparing it to silicon and diamond. The author predicts that the effects of covalent bonding in germanium will produce a peak at the midpoint of each bond. The study highlights the need for more precise measurements in the future to better understand the details of covalent bonding in germanium.
