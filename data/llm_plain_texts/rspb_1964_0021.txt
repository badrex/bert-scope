revised_title: 'The Prolongation of Active State in a Twitch due to Tension'

tldr: The author's experiments showed that when tension is maintained in a muscle during a twitch, the active state is prolonged, leading to extra energy production. This discovery helps to understand the relationship between tension and muscle activity, and has implications for muscle physiology and performance.
