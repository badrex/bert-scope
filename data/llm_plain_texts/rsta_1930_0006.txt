tldr: This article examines the problem of hydrodynamic stability in uniform shearing motion within a viscous fluid. The authors discuss previous work on the topic, analyze the possibility of inferring stability from an integral equation, and explore the method of normal coordinates. While the authors do not definitively answer the question of stability, they provide a critical review of existing research and present some preliminary results.
