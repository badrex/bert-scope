tldr: This lecture discusses the chemistry of nucleotides, focusing on the synthesis and structure of nucleic acids and nucleotide coenzymes. The author describes various methods for synthesizing nucleotides, including the use of dibenzyl phosphorochloridate as a phosphorylating agent. The lecture also covers the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and explains the structures of ribonucleic and deoxyribonucleic acids as 3'-linked polymers.
