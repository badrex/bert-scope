tldr: The author derives a theorem that generalizes the classical extinction theorem to cases where a rigid scatterer of arbitrary shape is located near a large compliant surface. This theorem relates the sound energy scattered from incident planar acoustic waves to the far field pressure in the specular reflection direction and that in the transmission direction, determined by the Snell's law. This approach simplifies the calculation of scattered energy and scattering cross-section for various applications, such as radar and sonar.
