revised_title: 'Precambrian Thermal Regimes: A Review of Archaean and Proterozoic Geothermal Gradients'
semantic_tags:
  - Geothermal gradients
  - Precambrian geology
  - Archaean geology
  - Proterozoic geology
  - Continental crust
tldr: This article discusses the thermal regimes of Precambrian eras, focusing on Archaean and Proterozoic complexes. It examines the geothermal gradients, crustal geotherms, and the conditions of magma-generation at depth. The author also explores the global context of heat flow and its potential impact on geological formations and tectonic systems. The study provides insights into the thermal conditions of the Earth's crust and mantle during these early periods of Earth's history.
