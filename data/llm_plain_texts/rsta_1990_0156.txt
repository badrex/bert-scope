tldr: The article discusses the development and demonstration of a new system, Atomizer, Source, Inductively Coupled Plasmas in Atomic Fluorescence Spectrometry (ASIA), which offers low detection limits, long linear dynamic range, and freedom from chemical and ionization effects. The system uses an inductively coupled plasma as both a light source and an atomizer, showing that it can effectively overcome spectral interferences and maintain the desirable features of Atomic Emission Spectrometry (AES). The article also highlights the potential applications of the ASIA system in various fields, including industrial and clinical samples.
