tldr: The author conducted experiments on spayed rhesus monkeys to study the role of oestrogenic hormone in the menstrual cycle. They discovered that fluctuations in oestrogenic stimulation, rather than ovulation, drive the menstrual rhythm. By injecting the monkeys with varying doses of oestrone, the author was able to induce uterine bleeding and create artificial menstrual cycles, providing insights into the hormonal regulation of the menstrual cycle.
