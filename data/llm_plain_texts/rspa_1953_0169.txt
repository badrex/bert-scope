tldr: The author investigates the pilot streamer in lightning and long sparks, providing a new explanation for the stepped process. They establish that the pilot streamer carries a similar current and charge per unit length as the leader behind it, and that the same mechanism is responsible for both lightning and long sparks. The study also invalidates pulsation theories of the stepped leader process.
