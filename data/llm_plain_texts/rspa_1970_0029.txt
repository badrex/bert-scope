tldr: The article investigates the unique determination of non-local potentials in two-body scattering, specifically focusing on the Wong class of potentials. The study uses the Lippmann-Schwinger form of the scattering equation and the analytic properties of the scattering amplitude to construct the potential from the scattering amplitude. The findings have implications for understanding forces in nuclear physics, particularly in nucleon-nucleon scattering.
