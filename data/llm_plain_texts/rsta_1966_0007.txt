tldr: The authors conducted a bathymetric, magnetic, and gravity survey of an area on the crest of the Carlsberg Ridge in the northwest Indian Ocean. They discovered a transcurrent fault with associated brecciation and metamorphism, which affected the rocks collected in the area. The magnetic survey revealed parallel anomalies with the trend of the ridge, suggesting uniform magnetization of the material represented by the bathymetry. The authors developed a model consistent with ocean floor spreading and periodic reversals in the Earth's magnetic field, which could have important implications for understanding the history of ocean basins.
