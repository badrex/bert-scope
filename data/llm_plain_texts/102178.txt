tldr: Dr. Wallis discusses the collection of secants and the true division of meridians in sea-charts. He explains the methods used by ancient mathematicians to partition figures and the importance of understanding the relationship between secants and radii in navigation. Wallis also mentions the work of Edward Wright and other mathematicians who contributed to the improvement of sea-chart representation.
