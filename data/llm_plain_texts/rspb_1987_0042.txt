tldr: The authors studied the effects of tightly-timed mossy-fibre arrival volleys in the cerebellar cortex. They identified presynaptic spike potentials, synaptic potentials, and granule-cell firing patterns. The research also revealed single glomerular potentials, which can sometimes be confused with cellular spike potentials. This work provides insights into the electrophysiology of the mossy-fibre pathway in the cerebellum.
