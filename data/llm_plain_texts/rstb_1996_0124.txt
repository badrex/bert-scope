tldr: This article discusses the possibility of fractionating the supervisory system of the prefrontal cortex into different subprocesses. The authors argue that novel situations require various types of processes, and they provide evidence of separability of these processes through neuropsychological dissociations and functional imaging. They also propose a theoretical framework for understanding the different processes involved in coping with novel situations, including strategy generation, implementation, monitoring, and assessment.
