tldr: The authors discovered an enzyme system in Escherichia coli that directly synthesizes phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) from pyruvate and ATP. This enzyme, called phosphoenolpyruvate synthase, plays a crucial role in anaplerotic reactions and biosynthetic pathways that enable the organism to grow on pyruvate as a sole carbon source.
