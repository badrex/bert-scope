tldr: This study investigates the temperature coefficients in the anion-catalyzed decomposition of nitramide. The authors found that the catalytic constant for anion catalysts varies with temperature, while the Arrhenius factor A remains nearly constant. The results provide insights into the theoretical basis of the Bronsted equation and the factors affecting reaction velocities.
