tldr: The authors conducted a detailed rotational analysis of the 0-0 band in the electronic transition of the phosphine molecule. They used a combination of experimental techniques and numerical calculations to determine the molecular parameters and rotational constants of the ground and excited states. The study provides insights into the structure and properties of phosphine and its electronic transitions.
