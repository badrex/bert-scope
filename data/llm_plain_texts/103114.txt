tldr: The author, F. Hauksbee, conducted experiments to study the effects of air passed through red hot metals and flames on living organisms and flames. He discovered that air passed through red hot metals could cause animals, like a cat, to convulse and appear dead, but they would eventually recover. Air passed through red hot charcoal had a similar effect. However, air passed through boiling water or flames of spirit of wine did not have a significant impact on living organisms or flames. These experiments provided insights into the properties of air and its effects on life and fire.
