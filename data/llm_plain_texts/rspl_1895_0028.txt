tldr: The author, J. Norman Lockyer, conducted experiments on gases obtained from minerals broggerite and euxenite. He discovered a new line in the infra-red spectrum, which he compared to the solar spectrum. This new line is coincident with a chromospheric line, and the author found three such lines in the spectra of the new gas obtained from minerals. This research contributes to the understanding of the chromosphere and the study of spectroscopy.
