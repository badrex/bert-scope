  - Solid-liquid phase transition
tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the heat capacity and heat of fusion of various substances to test Person's concept of absolute zero. They found that the temperature of no crystallization is not a constant for all bodies, and the heat capacities of solids and liquids should be determined at the same temperature, preferably the fusion point. This research provides a better understanding of the properties of substances and their phase transitions.
