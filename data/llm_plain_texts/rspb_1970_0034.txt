tldr: The study examines the autonomic nerve fibers and their vesicles in the frog's heart using electron microscopy. It compares the parasympathetic and sympathetic postganglionic nerve fibers, revealing differences in the types of vesicles and their contents. The research also discusses the absence of myelinated fibers in the ventricle and the various types of nerve bundles found in the frog's heart.
