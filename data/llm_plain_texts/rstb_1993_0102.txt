tldr: The Ecotron is a unique controlled environmental facility that allows researchers to study the population dynamics and ecosystem processes of entire communities under specified environmental conditions. It supports small, dynamic communities of up to 30 plant and metazoan species, making it one of the more biologically complex controlled environmental systems currently in use. The facility's artificial climate simulates natural environmental conditions within chambers, allowing experimental control over light, water, temperature, humidity, and UV-B radiation. Researchers can use the Ecotron to test various ecological theories and investigate issues such as leaf litter dynamics, spatial distributions, food web structure, and biodiversity.
