revised_title: 'Anatomy and Adaptation Mechanisms of the Retina in Ephestia Moths'

tldr: The authors studied the retina of the Ephestia moth, focusing on its unique adaptation mechanisms. They discovered that the moth's retina has ten retinula cells and a crystalline tract that changes during light and dark adaptation. This research helps to understand the neuropteran type of eye and its distinct optical arrangement.
