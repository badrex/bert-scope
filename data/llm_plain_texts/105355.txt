tldr: The author, Samuel Pullein, discovered a new species of cocoon or silk-pod from America, which he believed could produce silk superior to that of the common silk-worm in both quality and quantity. He described the appearance and characteristics of the cocoon, its silk, and the moth responsible for its production. Pullein also shared his experiments and findings, suggesting that the silk could be of great value and encouraged people in America to make use of this resource.
