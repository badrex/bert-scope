tldr: In 1665, William Ball observed a unique shape of Saturn's ring system. He shared his observation with other astronomers, asking them to examine the figure and compare it to their own observations. This sparked curiosity among the scientific community, leading them to investigate the appearance of Saturn's rings and the possibility of notches or hollow spaces within them.
