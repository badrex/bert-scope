semantic_tags:
  - Molecular chaperone
  - Chromatin structure
  - Nucleosome assembly
  - Sperm chromatin decondensation
  - Histone proteins
tldr: 'The article discusses the role of nucleoplasmin, a molecular chaperone, in chromatin assembly and disassembly. Nucleoplasmin helps in the formation of nucleosomes by binding histones H2A and H2B and transferring them to DNA. It also plays a role in sperm chromatin decondensation at fertilization by removing sperm basic proteins and replacing them with histones H2A and H2B, forming nucleosomes and resulting in decondensation of the compacted sperm chromatin.'
