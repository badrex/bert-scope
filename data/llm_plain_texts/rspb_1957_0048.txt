tldr: 'The authors discovered a new factor called "interferon" that is released from cells when they are exposed to heat-inactivated viruses. Interferon induces a defense mechanism in cells, preventing the growth of live viruses. This discovery led to a better understanding of the immune response against viral infections and the development of antiviral therapies.'
