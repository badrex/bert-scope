tldr: 'The author, A. W. Hofmann, explores the phosphorus-bases and their derivatives, specifically focusing on the reaction between disulphide of carbon and triethylphosphine. The study reveals the formation of various compounds, including the yellow crystals containing CS H7 P S3. The author also discusses the transformation of these compounds under different conditions and their potential applications in chemistry.'
