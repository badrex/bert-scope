tldr: The author investigates the effects of potassium, calcium, and sodium ions on the beating and micro-fibrillation of chick embryo hearts. They found that the presence of potassium or calcium in the medium causes fibrillation, while the absence of calcium leads to weakened or stopped beating. The study provides insights into the control of heart activity and the role of ions in cellular signaling.
