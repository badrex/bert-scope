tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate the chemical activity of helium under intense electronic bombardment. They discovered strong evidence of a tungsten helide (WHe2) formation, a black solid that decomposes at high temperatures. The authors also found that vapors of mercury, iodine, phosphorus, and sulfur unite with helium, forming stable substances at liquid-air temperatures.
