tldr: This article examines the foraging strategies and natural diet of monkeys, apes, and humans, focusing on hominid carnivory and its implications for early archaeological sites. The study analyzes the tissue types exploited by early hominids from carcasses, possibly acquired through scavenging, and evaluates the skeletal part profiles from two archaeological sites in Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania. The results suggest that hominids maximized marrow yields rather than flesh yields when processing carcasses, and the findings are combined with discussions of predation risk, feeding competition, and equipment needs to identify the socio-economic function of early archaeological sites.
