revised_title: 'The Effect of Temperature on Ciliary Movement and Oxygen Consumption'
semantic_tags:
  - Ciliary movement
  - Temperature effects
  - Oxygen consumption
  - Biological processes
  - Enzyme stability
tldr: This study investigates the impact of temperature on ciliary movement and oxygen consumption in Mytilus gills. The authors found that increasing temperature affects ciliary movement and cell stability, with a gradual reduction in the amplitude of the ciliary beat and a decrease in oxygen consumption. The results suggest that high temperatures may cause a loss of enzyme stability rather than a lack of oxygen.
