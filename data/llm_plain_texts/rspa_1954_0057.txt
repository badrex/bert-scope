tldr: The article presents Bhabha's equation for a particle with two mass states, formulated in Rarita-Schwinger form. The author demonstrates the equivalence of this theory with Bhabha's original equation and discusses the solutions of the equations of motion. The theory can be quantized in accordance with the Pauli principle, and the charge conjugate state is defined.
