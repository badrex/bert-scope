tldr: The authors improve upon the stability theory of solitary waves, focusing on the Korteweg-de Vries equation and an alternative model equation for the propagation of long waves in nonlinear dispersive media. They refine Benjamin's theory by removing assumptions, correcting errors, and providing a more robust proof, ensuring the stability of solitary waves in various scenarios.
