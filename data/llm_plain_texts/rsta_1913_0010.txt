tldr: The author investigates the effect of obstacles on electric waves, determining the distribution of electric and magnetic forces on the obstacle's surface. The study focuses on the conditions that must be met at the obstacle's surface and the principal parts of the electric and magnetic forces at various points. The findings contribute to understanding wave propagation and interference in the context of electromagnetic theory.
