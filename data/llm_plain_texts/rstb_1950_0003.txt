tldr: The article examines the reproductive processes and anatomy of the basking shark, a large and common yet little-studied species. The authors provide a detailed description of the male and female reproductive systems, including the testes, epididymis, and ampulla, as well as the breeding cycle and life history of the species. The study contributes to the understanding of elasmobranch biology and sheds light on the reproductive and anatomical features of the basking shark.
