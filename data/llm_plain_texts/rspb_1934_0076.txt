tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the development of the avian knee-joint in vitro using tissue culture techniques. They observed the early histological development of the knee-joint and found that the tissue at the site of the future articulation is chondrogenic in normal development. The study provides insights into the process of joint-formation and the role of extrinsic and intrinsic factors in shaping the articular surfaces of bones.
