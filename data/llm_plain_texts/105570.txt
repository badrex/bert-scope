tldr: 'Astronomer Nevil Maskelyne conducted observations at the Island of St. Helena using a reflecting telescope and an equal altitude instrument. He discovered issues with the suspension of the plumb-line in the instruments, which affected the accuracy of the observations. Maskelyne also attempted to measure the horary parallaxes of the moon, which could help determine the mean equatorial parallax. Although his observations were hindered by the instrument's imperfections, Maskelyne's work contributed to the improvement of future astronomical instruments.'
