tldr: This article presents an appendix detailing the degenerations resulting from lesions in the gyrus marginalis and gyrus fornicatus in monkeys. The results suggest a differentiation in the pyramidal tract, with only a corresponding part degenerating after removal of one motor area. The study contributes to understanding the motor cortex and its connections.
