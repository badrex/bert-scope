tldr: This study investigates the heat-tension ratio in prolonged tetanic contractions and finds that the slope of the duration curves varies with temperature. The results show that the temperature coefficient is too small and requires correction. The authors also discover that a higher concentration of iodo-acetic acid is needed to poison a muscle at a lower temperature for a given duration of stimulation. This research contributes to our understanding of muscle physiology and heat production during muscle contractions.
