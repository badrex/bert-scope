tldr: The author proposes a new basis for cosmology by connecting the ratio of the gravitational to the electric force between elementary particles with the present epoch. This connection suggests that very large dimensionless numbers occurring in nature are simple powers of the epoch, with coefficients of the order of unity. The author also derives the law of recession of spiral nebulae, which shows that the velocities of recession vary proportionally to the epoch.
