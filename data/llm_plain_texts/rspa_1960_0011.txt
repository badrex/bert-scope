tldr: The authors studied the combustion of gaseous aldehydes, specifically formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, using flash photolysis and kinetic spectroscopy techniques. They identified and observed the behavior of radicals involved in the combustion process, providing further information on the combustion mechanisms of these aldehydes. The study focused on the reaction between formyl radicals and oxygen, which is significant in the combustion of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde.
