tldr: The article presents a study on the factors influencing climate change, particularly focusing on water vapour, CO2, and insolation over the last glacial-interglacial cycles. A two-dimensional climate model is used to simulate the effects of astronomical forcing and CO2 changes on the climate system. The results show that orbital variations can induce feedbacks sufficient to generate low-frequency climatic variations, and the model's simulations are in broad agreement with reconstructions of ice-sheet volume and sea level from geological data.
