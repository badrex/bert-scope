tldr: This article studies the stress intensity factors for an embedded elliptical crack in a finite-thickness plate subjected to shear stresses. The author uses the Galerkin method to solve the derived pair of integro-differential equations and presents the stress intensity magnification factors in graphical form for various crack aspect ratios, thickness-to-semi-minor axis ratios, and shear stress directions.
