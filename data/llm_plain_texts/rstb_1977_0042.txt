tldr: The study investigates the plasticity of intertectal neuronal connections in adult Xenopus and how they respond to changes in binocular geometry. The research demonstrates that the intertectal system can undergo small-scale plasticity in post-metamorphic life, allowing it to adjust and compensate for changes in interocular distance and angle. This plasticity is essential for maintaining a detailed congruence of the ipsilateral and contralateral visuotectal connections throughout the animal's life.
