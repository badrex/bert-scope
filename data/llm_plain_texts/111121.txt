tldr: The author, John Stenhouse, conducted experiments to study the effects of nitric acid on various plants, focusing on the common broom plant (Spartium scoparium). He discovered that the plant contains two main compounds: scoparine, a diuretic principle, and sparteine, a volatile organic base with narcotic properties. The research also found that a greater number of plants can yield nitropicric acid than previously thought.
