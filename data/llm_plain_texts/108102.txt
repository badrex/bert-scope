tldr: The author, George Newport, investigates the temperature of insects and discovers that each individual insect maintains a separate temperature of body, which varies in different states. He also explores the connection between the evolution of animal heat, respiration, and circulation in insects. This research contributes to understanding the physiology of insects and their ability to regulate their body temperature.
