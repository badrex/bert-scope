tldr: The author conducted various experiments to study electricity and its properties. They discovered that some materials, called electricals, can be easily excited to electricity, while others, called non-electricals, cannot. The author also found that electricals can transfer their properties to non-electricals, and the efficiency of this transfer depends on the distance and surrounding conditions. These findings helped in understanding the behavior of electricity and its applications.
