tldr: Abbe Nollet's experiments with electricity reveal that it can increase the insensible perspiration of animals and the growth of plants. The electrical virtue can also accelerate the flow of liquids through tubes and increase the evaporation of various liquids. These findings suggest potential applications for electricity in agriculture and medicine, such as facilitating plant growth and increasing the efficiency of perspiration in humans.
