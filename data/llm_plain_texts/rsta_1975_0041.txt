tldr: This article discusses a gravity survey of the western English Channel between Lyme Bay and St Brieuc Bay, conducted by the Institute of Geological Sciences in 1972 and 1973. The survey reveals various geological features, including a regional gradient of about 0.2 mGal/km, a low-gravity region in Lyme Bay attributed to a Mesozoic basin, and a ridge of high gravity extending eastward from Start Point. The study provides insights into the geology and tectonics of the region, contributing to a better understanding of the English Channel's structure.
