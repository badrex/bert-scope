tldr: The author, Samuel Solly, investigates the connection between the anterior columns of the spinal cord and the cerebellum in humans, horses, and sheep. He demonstrates that the corpora pyramidalia are only half composed of the anterior columns and identifies another portion called the antero-lateral column. Solly suggests that these columns are involved in both voluntary and involuntary movements and that the facial and pneumogastric nerves arise from multiple tracts.
