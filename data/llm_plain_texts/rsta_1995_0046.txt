tldr: The article presents a design-led procedure for selecting materials that can resist creep, creep fracture, creep relaxation, and creep buckling at high temperatures. This method extends a successful room temperature design process using performance indices and material-selection charts. The authors define a 'design strength' to characterize material response under design-imposed conditions and rank materials using an optimization procedure to meet design specifications.
