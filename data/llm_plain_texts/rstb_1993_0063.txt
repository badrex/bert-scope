tldr: This article discusses the evolution and design of animal signaling systems, particularly in territorial systems. It focuses on the abilities of signal receivers to identify neighboring individuals and estimate their distance, which are crucial for efficient territory defense. The article also explores the potential for eavesdropping in communication networks and its implications for territorial animals like songbirds and electric fish.
