tldr: The author investigates cytoplasmic differentiation in fungi using heterokaryotic fungi like Penicillium cyclopium, Aspergillus glaucus, and A. nidulans. They separate phenotypic differences of nuclear and cytoplasmic origin and classify three types of cytoplasmic changes. The author also explores induced cytoplasmic changes, such as adaptation and non-adaptive, and their effects on fungi's performance and growth. These findings contribute to understanding cytoplasmic inheritance and genetic differentiation in fungi.
