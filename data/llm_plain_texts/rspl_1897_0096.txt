tldr: Professor Edgeworth David's team conducted a boring at the Funafuti Atoll to study the coral reef and submarine slope. They reached a depth of 643 feet and discovered that true reef has been found at depths up to 600 feet. The research suggests that coral must have grown in great abundance in the area for a long time, despite being surrounded by deep water.
