tldr: This article presents the results of continued tide observations at various locations on the British coasts. The author, W. Whewell, discusses the height of high water and the variations it undergoes from springs to neaps and vice versa. The study finds that the curve of heights is nearly the same at all these places, and the semi-mensual series of heights at one place can be used as a rule for other places with the same difference of spring and neap heights. The author also analyzes the equilibrium theory and its properties, finding that the actual tides are modified in a way described in the article. The study shows that the ratio of springs to neaps is smaller where the tide is smaller.
