tldr: The authors studied the flow of water through the Straits of Dover and its relation to wind and differences in sea level. They used electric potential differences on a cross-channel telephone cable to measure the mean flow of water and found that the greatest daily rates of flow were towards the northeast and southwest. The results showed the existence of current surges and were correlated with local wind in the Straits and the difference in sea level between the English Channel and the North Sea.
