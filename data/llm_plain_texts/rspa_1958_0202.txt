tldr: This article presents preliminary measurements of the thermal conductivity and expansion of ice and heavy water. The authors found that the thermal conductivity values for normal and heavy ice forms were in fair agreement and not greatly different from earlier data for normal ice. They also determined the linear thermal expansion coefficients for two crystalline directions in ice and found a small anisotropy.
