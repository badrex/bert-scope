tldr: 'The N-end rule governs the selective protein turnover and stability of proteins. The researchers found that the nature of the amino acid at the N-terminus of a protein determines its half-life. This rule helps explain the diverse half-lives of proteins in cells and the selective destruction of mis-compartmentalized proteins. The N-end rule may also play a role in the regulation of protein stability and the function of post-translational addition of single amino acids to protein N-termini.'
