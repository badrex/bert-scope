tldr: The authors apply a spin-wave theory to study the influence of anisotropic nearest-neighbor interactions and next-nearest-neighbor interactions on the stability of antiferromagnetic orders in face-centered cubic lattices. They find that certain types of order are stable under specific conditions, and discuss the implications for antiferromagnetic resonance.
