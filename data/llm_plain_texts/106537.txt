tldr: The author, George Atwood, presents a general theory for measuring the angle subtended by two objects observed by rays after two reflections from plane surfaces. This theory is applicable to various practical applications in astronomy and can be used to determine the angular distance between celestial objects. The method involves using two reflecting surfaces, one fixed and the other moveable, and observing the objects through a telescope. The theory provides a way to calculate the angle by using four data points, which include the angular distance of the moveable radius, the common inclination of the reflecting planes, the fixed angle of incidence at the fixed speculum, and the position of the plane of reflection.
