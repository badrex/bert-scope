tldr: The authors conducted experiments to compare the spectra of fluorescent X-ray radiations from different elements. They discovered that radiations with the same absorption coefficients in aluminum also have similar absorption coefficients in other elements, suggesting that the radiations are of a similar nature. Further research is needed to determine if the two series of radiations are identical.
