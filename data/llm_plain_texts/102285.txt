tldr: Dr. John Wallis explains his method for calculating the quadrature of spaces in the cycloid and related figures. He demonstrates that not only the cycloid but also other portions of the figure are capable of being squared. Wallis also discusses the work of Mr. Caswell, who provided a new method for calculating the quadrature of a portion of the epicycloid.
