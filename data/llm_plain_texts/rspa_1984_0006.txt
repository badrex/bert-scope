tldr: The authors conducted Compton profile measurements on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite to investigate its electronic structure. They compared the results of two new X-ray measurements with earlier X-ray and electron scattering measurements. A tight-binding calculation and earlier calculations based on a molecular model and a pseudo-potential wavefunction were considered. The analysis showed that none of the calculations adequately described the data in the basal plane, and the zero-crossing theorem appeared to be violated. In the c-axis direction, the molecular model and tight-binding calculation provided better agreement with the experimental data than the pseudo-potential calculation.
