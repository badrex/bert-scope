tldr: This study examines insect populations on Aldabra Atoll, analyzing their abundance, composition, and seasonal fluctuations at various locations. The research considers ecological factors such as vegetation and the presence of higher animals like giant tortoises and birds. The findings show that insect catches were similar in composition at coastal locations, while lagoon locations had more Coleoptera and Diptera. Insect density was generally higher at the east end of the atoll, and numbers were most abundant during the wetter months from November 1971 to April 1972.
