tldr: The author studied the photographic spectrum of the Orion Nebula and found it to be a compound spectrum consisting of hydrogen lines, low and high-temperature metallic lines, and emissions. The spectrum resembles that of planetary nebulae and bright line stars, suggesting a close association between these celestial bodies. The research strengthens the view that bright line stars occupy an intermediate position between nebulae and stars of Groups II and III.
