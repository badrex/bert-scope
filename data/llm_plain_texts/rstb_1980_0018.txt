tldr: The World Health Organization has played a significant role in studying influenza since its inception in 1947. The organization established a network of national influenza centers and collaborating laboratories that work together to isolate and characterize influenza strains, standardize diagnostic procedures, and develop vaccines. Research organized by WHO has contributed to our understanding of the epidemiology of influenza, including the potential role of lower animals as the origin of some pandemic strains. The organization has also conducted studies on animal influenza to determine their importance in the epidemiology of human influenza and the potential for new pandemics. Recent advances in techniques such as nucleic and amino acid sequencing and monoclonal antibody studies have provided compelling evidence for the role of animal reservoirs in the emergence of new strains.
