tldr: This article discusses the role of major impact processes in the evolution of the lunar crust, using terrestrial impact craters as analogues for understanding lunar structures and estimating the depth of lunar crust disturbance. The study of impact craters on Earth, Mars, and Mercury helps in understanding the formation and evolution of the Moon's surface.
