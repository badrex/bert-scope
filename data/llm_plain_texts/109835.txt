tldr: The author, Everard Home, discusses the hermaphroditic nature of Lamprey and Myxine, which supports his theory that these creatures occupy an intermediate position between fish and worms. He explains that the organs previously thought to be kidneys in supposed females are actually testicles, and that supposed males do not breed due to not having distinct sexes.
