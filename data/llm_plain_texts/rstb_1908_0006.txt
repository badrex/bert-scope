revised_title: 'The Role of Periosteum and Bone Elements in Development and Regeneration'
semantic_tags:
  - Bone regeneration

tldr: 'The author investigates the role of periosteum and various elements in bone development and regeneration. Experiments show that the periosteum alone is not responsible for bone regeneration, and other factors, such as the bone itself, play a significant role in the process. The study also demonstrates that bone can produce new bone tissue even when denuded of its periosteum.'
