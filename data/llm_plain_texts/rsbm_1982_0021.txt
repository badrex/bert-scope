tldr: 'This biographical memoir recounts the life and work of Tracy Morton Sonneborn, a pioneering geneticist who made significant contributions to the field of protozoology. Sonneborn is best known for his work on the ciliate Paramecium, where he discovered mating types and established genetics along Mendelian lines. Although his findings have not significantly contributed to the established corpus of genetic theory, his work with Paramecium has been influential in the field of protozoology and may point to new directions for research with other organisms.'
