tldr: This article discusses the lesser-known chemical work of James Watt, primarily remembered for his improvements to the steam engine. It explores his attempts to perfect a synthetic process for alkali production, his development of a copying press ink, and his invention of an iron cement for steam engine joints. These innovations played a significant role in the early phase of the Industrial Revolution.
