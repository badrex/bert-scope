revised_title: 'Criticisms on Dr. Chapman's Analysis of Magnetic Storm Phenomena'
semantic_tags:
  - Geomagnetism

  - Earth's magnetic axis
  - Storm time
  - Magnetic disturbances
tldr: The author critiques Dr. Chapman's analysis of magnetic storms, specifically the classification of stations based on their distance from the Earth's magnetic axis. The author argues that Agincourt, a highly disturbed station, does not fit well into this classification. They also question the use of "storm time" and the criteria for selecting storms for analysis.
