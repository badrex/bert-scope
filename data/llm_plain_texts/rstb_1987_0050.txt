tldr: This article discusses the groundbreaking work of Hermann Hellriegel, who scientifically explained the nitrogen nutrition of legumes and opened the way for agronomy promoting soil fertility. Hellriegel's research led to the development of new cropping methods and the understanding of the relationship between root nodules and nitrogen assimilation in legumes. His discoveries had a significant impact on agricultural research and soil fertility.
