tldr: The author examines the structure of the vertebral column and fins of the Proteo-saurus, a transitional fossil between lizards and cartilaginous fish. The study reveals similarities to shark vertebral structures and discusses the difficulty in classifying the fins as either forelimbs or fins. This research contributes to understanding the evolution of vertebrates and their adaptations.
