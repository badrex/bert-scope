tldr: The author proposes that high mutation rates in viruses, particularly human retroviruses, can be advantageous for evading the immune system. This is due to the need to generate genetic variation among parasites. The study focuses on HIV-1, which has a high mutation rate, and suggests that this rate increases the chances of diverging from earlier viruses to escape destruction by the immune system. The interplay of sexual activity, replication rate, and mutation rate helps explain the recent emergence of the HIV-1 pandemic and offers potential ways to control it and prevent similar pandemics in the future.
