tldr: The authors conducted experiments with synthetic polycyclic compounds to study their oestrogenic activity. They found that some compounds in the series of diols related to 1:2:5:6-dibenzanthracene showed oestrogenic activity. The authors also examined a variety of diols of analogous structure and discussed the effect of molecular structure on oestrogenic activity. However, they were unable to determine the exact configuration of the compounds and its effect on oestrogenic activity.
