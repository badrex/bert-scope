tldr: This article discusses the collision between two electrons and the anomalous scattering that occurs when they interact. The authors explore the differences between classical and quantum scattering laws and provide experimental evidence in favor of the quantum theory. They also consider the implications of electron spin and the exclusion principle on collision problems.
