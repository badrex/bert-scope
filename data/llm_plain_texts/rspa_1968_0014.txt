tldr: The authors use electron spin resonance to study reactions of free oxygen and hydrogen atoms with simple hydrocarbons. They find that the reactions are first-order in free atom concentration and provide insights into the mechanisms of these reactions. The technique allows for the detection of paramagnetic free atoms in gases at low pressures, making it a valuable tool for understanding chemical reactions.
