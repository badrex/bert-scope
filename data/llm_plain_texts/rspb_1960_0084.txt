tldr: The study investigates the role of the vertical lobe in the formation of long-lasting representations in the memory of octopuses. It shows that food and shock can increase or decrease the tendency to attack specific figures, and the vertical lobe plays a crucial role in ensuring persistence in the memory of appropriate distinct representations. Without the vertical lobe, establishing lasting representations becomes more difficult.
