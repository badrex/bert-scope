tldr: This article explores the degree of heat required to coagulate lymph and serum in blood. The author, William Hewson, conducted experiments to determine the specific temperatures needed for coagulation and found that lymph coagulates at a lower temperature than serum. The study also investigates the formation of the inflammatory crust, or size, which is formed by the coagulable lymph after the red particles have subsided.
