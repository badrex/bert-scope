tldr: The authors discovered a rudimentary head-kidney in embryo chicks, which is identical to the head-kidney present in Amphibia, Marsipobranchii, and Teleostei. They found that the abdominal opening of the Mullerian duct in birds is the homologue of the abdominal opening of the segmental duct in Amphibia, providing evidence of homology between the two species.
