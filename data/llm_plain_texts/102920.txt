tldr: 'During the great storm of 1703, John Fuller of Sussex observed strange effects in his area. The storm was so powerful that it caused saltwater to be blown inland up to 10 miles from the coast. The next day, tree branches were found to be white and tasted salty. This phenomenon was reported in various locations within a 15-mile radius of the sea, both in valleys and on hills.'
