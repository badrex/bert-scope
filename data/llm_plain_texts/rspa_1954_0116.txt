tldr: The author explores the one-dimensional case of free electrons interacting with lattice displacements in superconductivity. They find that a single sinusoidal lattice displacement creates an energy gap in the single-electron energy spectrum, leading to periodic fluctuations in electronic density. This periodic displacement allows electrons to move through the lattice without being disturbed, resulting in a superfluid-like behavior and the elimination of residual resistance.
