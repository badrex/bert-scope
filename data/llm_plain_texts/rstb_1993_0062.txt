tldr: 'The authors discuss the evolution and design of animal signaling systems, focusing on post-insemination signaling systems and reinforcement. They argue that strong selection against hybridization is crucial for reinforcement to occur and present a case study on ground crickets Allonemobius fasciatus and A. socius. The study shows that barriers to fertilization can evolve quickly and promote the evolution of premating isolation. The authors emphasize the importance of studying post-insemination signaling systems to better understand the role of reinforcement in the evolution of prezygotic barriers to gene exchange.'
