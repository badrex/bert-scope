tldr: This paper discusses the observations of 380 double and triple stars made between 1821 and 1823 by John Herschel and James South. They compared their findings with other astronomers' work and documented changes in the stars' positions since their initial discovery. The authors also describe a five-feet equatorial instrument used in their observations. The investigation aimed to determine the existence of annual parallax, which could help understand the construction of the universe.
