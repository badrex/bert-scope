tldr: This article explores the effects of sample size, external fields, and boundary conditions on the behavior of nematic liquid crystals using a lattice model. The author's continuum theory of disorder is applied to the model, providing insights into the alignment of molecules and the nematic order parameter. The results show that the theory can describe the behavior of the model and has implications for understanding real nematic liquid crystals.
