tldr: This study investigates the effects of free fall on human subjects' tendon reflexes. Researchers used a falling chair to suddenly drop subjects and observed changes in their neurological responses. They found that voluntary activity becomes impossible during the fall, and the ankle jerk is temporarily suppressed. The study suggests that these changes are due to weightlessness and the resulting changes in muscle shape.
