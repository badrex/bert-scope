tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine if the sugar found in the liver after death is a natural representation of the liver's condition during life. They discovered that the presence of sugar in the liver is due to a post-mortem occurrence and not a natural function of the liver. The author also found that the liver contains a substance called hepatine, which is responsible for the presence of sugar in the liver after death. This research helps to explain the relationship between liver function, blood sugar levels, and diabetes.
