tldr: The authors conducted a study on the absorption spectrum of lithium vapour, focusing on the principal series and band structures. They used a spectrograph and a carbon arc as a source of continuous radiation to measure the wavelengths of the principal series and observed a complicated many-lined spectrum at higher temperatures. The study provided more accurate values for the wavelengths and confirmed the predictions of Holtsmark's theory of line broadening.
