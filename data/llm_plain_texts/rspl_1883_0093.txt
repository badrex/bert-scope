tldr: The article discusses the changes in the gland-cells of the carnivorous plant Dionaea muscipula during the process of secretion. It describes the different stages of digestion, from the resting state to the absorptive period, and the formation of crystals and other substances in the cells. The study helps to understand the digestive and defense mechanisms of carnivorous plants.
