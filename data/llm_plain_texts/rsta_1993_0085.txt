tldr: The article discusses the formation of repetitive mineralogic patterns in sedimentary rocks through self-organization and reaction-transport feedback during diagenesis. The authors explain various mechanisms, such as oscillatory intracrystalline zoning, Liesegang banding, and mechano-chemical feedback, that contribute to the development of these patterns in sedimentary basins. These patterns can vary in scale from microns to kilometers and have significant implications for understanding the geological processes occurring in sedimentary rocks.
