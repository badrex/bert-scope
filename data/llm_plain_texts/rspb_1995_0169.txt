tldr: 'This study found a positive association between divorce rates and extra-pair paternity in socially monogamous bird species. High rates of divorce are linked to high rates of extra-pair paternity, suggesting that birds may divorce to gain a better breeding position. This discovery sheds light on the adaptiveness of divorce and extra-pair copulations in birds and natural variation in mate quality among populations or species.'
