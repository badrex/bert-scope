tldr: The authors conducted a series of re-determinations of the coefficients of thermal expansion of pure nickel and cobalt using an interference dilatometer. They found that the coefficient of linear expansion for nickel is slightly greater than that of cobalt, and this difference increases with temperature. The metal with the lower atomic weight, nickel, expands more than the metal with the higher atomic weight, cobalt.
