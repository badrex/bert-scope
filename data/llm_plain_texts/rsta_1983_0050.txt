tldr: The article discusses the potential benefits of coordinating the launch and revisit cycles of three planned remote-sensing satellites (ERS-1, Radarsat, and ERTS-1) for ocean studies. The authors suggest that a coordinated effort could lead to more efficient and effective observations, and they mention ongoing discussions among space agencies and the Joint Scientific Committee of the World Climate Research Programme to achieve this goal.
