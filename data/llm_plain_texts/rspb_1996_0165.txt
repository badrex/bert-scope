tldr: The study investigates genetic variation in male size and its reliability as an indicator in seaweed flies. It shows that male size has higher coefficients of additive genetic variance compared to female size, and that most of this genetic variation is attributable to the chromosomal inversion associated with larval survival. The research suggests that indirect sexual selection is an inconsistent force of evolution, with varying levels of reliability in natural populations.
