tldr: The authors studied the isotope effect in acetylenedicarboxylic acid dihydrate and compared it with oxalic acid dihydrate. They found that the crystal structure of acetylenedicarboxylic acid dihydrate expands when deuterium replaces hydrogen, similar to the effect observed in oxalic acid dihydrate. The results suggest that short isotope bonds involve an overlap of two structures.
