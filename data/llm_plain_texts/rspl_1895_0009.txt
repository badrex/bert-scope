tldr: The authors studied the properties of Acokanthera Schimperi, a wood extract used to make arrow poison in East Africa. They discovered that the active ingredient, acokantherin, has similar pharmacological effects to Strophanthus seeds. Acokantherin can slow down the heart rate, increase the size of heart movements, and raise blood pressure. The authors suggest that the main effects of acokantherin are on the heart and not on the cardio-respiratory centers in the medulla.
