tldr: This study investigates the evolution of myoglobin in various species, focusing on the phylogenetic patterns within mammalian orders and the impact of parallel substitutions. The authors analyze amino acid difference matrices and consider the functional relevance of certain positions in the myoglobin molecule. They also discuss the rate of molecular evolution and its implications for dating evolutionary events.
