tldr: The author discusses the difficulties encountered in obtaining perfect pictures using the Daguerreotype process, even with a lens corrected for spherical and chromatic aberration. They found that the focus of photogenic action is not coincident with the visual focus in achromatic object-glasses, and the distance between these two foci varies according to the nature of the glass combination, their dispersive powers, and the degree of light intensity. By adjusting the Daguerreotype plate to the focus of photogenic rays, the author achieved perfect object delineations.
