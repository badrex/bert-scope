tldr: The authors study the curious behavior of the rattleback, a mechanical top with a curved lower surface, when spun on a smooth horizontal surface. They investigate the spin reversal phenomenon and analyze the role of inertial asymmetry, friction, and dissipation in the dynamic behavior of the rattleback. A numerical model is developed to explain the spin reversal and predict the behavior of the rattleback, providing a comprehensive understanding of this fascinating mechanical system.
