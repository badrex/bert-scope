tldr: The authors studied the histological structure and function of striped muscles in relation to their contractile activity. They found that the differences in microscopical and macroscopical structure of muscles with varying contractile properties are associated with the presence of two types of muscle fibers: granular (red) and clear (white) fibers. These fiber types are found in various species and are linked to the speed of muscle contraction and fatigue resistance.
