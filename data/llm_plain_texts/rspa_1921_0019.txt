tldr: The author conducted experiments to analyze the color and composition of the night sky's light. They used a series of colored filters and a photometric wedge to measure the intensity of the light transmitted by each filter. The results showed that the night sky's light is richer in yellow and red components compared to the clear twilight sky. The author also compared the light from the sun, moon, and night sky, finding that the ultra-violet and red ends of the spectrum have a smaller fraction of the overall photographic effect.
