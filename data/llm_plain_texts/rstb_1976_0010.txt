tldr: The authors discuss the biosynthesis of porphyrins, chlorophyll, and vitamin B, focusing on the role of protoporphyrin as an intermediate in chlorophyll synthesis. They explore the enzymatic reactions and pathways involved, including the insertion of magnesium into protoporphyrin, and the role of ALA synthesis in regulating chlorophyll synthesis. The authors also discuss the different forms of protochlorophyllide and their transformation into chlorophyllide.
