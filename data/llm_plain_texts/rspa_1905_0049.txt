tldr: This article investigates the widening of a spectrum line due to the motion of molecules in the line of sight and the influence of collisions between molecules. The author discusses the difference between the simple theory, which only considers the Doppler effect, and a more complex analysis that takes into account the collisions and molecular motion. The results of these calculations are compared, and the author identifies an error in the more complex analysis that leads to a discrepancy in the spectrum line's constitution.
