tldr: The authors investigated the electrical conductivity caused by insoluble monomolecular films of fatty acid on water. They found that only about one-ninth of the monomolecular layer of stearic acid on water is dissociated, and measured the surface conductivity in absolute units. This study provides evidence for the existence of mobile ions within the solution corresponding to unbalanced charges on the interface, which is essential for understanding electrokinetic phenomena.
