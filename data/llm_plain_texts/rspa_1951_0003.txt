tldr: The authors studied the region of low-pressure explosion for hydrogen/oxygen mixtures in boric acid-coated vessels. They observed a different explosion curve that could not be explained by existing mechanisms. A new mathematical expression was introduced, which suggests the participation of a second-order branching process not operative in salt-coated vessels. A revised mechanism is proposed to account for the new findings.
