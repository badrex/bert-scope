  - Axially symmetric solutions
  - Weyl's line element
  - Newtonian gravitational potential
tldr: The authors present a general solution in closed form for axially symmetric static solutions of Einstein's vacuum field equations, using Weyl's line element. They demonstrate the solution's compatibility with the equations and provide examples of its application, such as finding potential functions and associated functions in the line element.
