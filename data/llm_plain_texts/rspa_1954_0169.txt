tldr: The authors studied the electrical properties and thermo-electric potential of chromium oxide-alumina catalysts. They found that the addition of alumina initially increased the conductivity, but with higher concentrations, it decreased to values below that of chromium oxide alone. The catalysts were found to be n-type semiconductors if they contained more than about 35% chromium oxide, while those with lower chromium content were p-type semiconductors. The results provide insights into the relationship between electrical properties and catalytic activity.
