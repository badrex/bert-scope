tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the vertical and lateral pressures of granular substances, specifically wheat, stored in bins. They discovered that the pressure on the bottom of the bin decreases as the height of the wheat increases, and the lateral pressure is considerably less than the vertical pressure. This research provided valuable data for engineers and others involved in designing structures to store grain.
