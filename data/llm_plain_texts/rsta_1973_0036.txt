tldr: This study investigates the palaeomagnetism of Mount Etna's lavas to determine the history of the geomagnetic field direction over the past centuries. The research uses lavas that became magnetized during cooling and employs modern techniques to reduce measurement errors. The results show a trend of the archaeomagnetic variation over 600 years, in agreement with other observatories' findings. However, reaching further into the past is limited by the lack of accurate historical records and thermoluminescence dating methods.
