tldr: The authors developed a semi-quantal method to study electron-ion recombination in dense molecular gases, which is important for understanding ionization in flames. They calculated recombination coefficients for hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and damp mixtures of gases, finding that recombination is greatly facilitated by the presence of even a small amount of water vapor. This research provides a more accurate understanding of the recombination process in molecular gases compared to previous methods.
