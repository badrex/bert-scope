tldr: This article presents experimental and theoretical determinations of bond lengths in naphthalene and anthracene, comparing the results with molecular orbital and Pauling theories. The findings show that these simple theories provide satisfactory predictions for bond lengths in aromatic molecules, such as -dibenzacridine and chrysene. The success of these theories is attributed to a correlation between their respective bond orders.
