tldr: The author, J. T. Desaguliers, explains the rising and falling of water in ponds near the sea and ebbing and flowing rivers through a series of experiments. He uses a Tantalus, a cup that holds water until a certain level is reached, to demonstrate how water levels change with the tides. The experiments can also be applied to ponds and brooks that are high in dry weather and low in wet weather.
