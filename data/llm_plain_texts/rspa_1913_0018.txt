tldr: The author presents a new method to correct field curvature in Cassegrain reflectors while maintaining their achromatism and other design features. The approach involves using a combination of lenses and mirrors, with the main challenge being to find the appropriate distribution of curvatures between the lenses. The solution is achieved through a series of approximations and calculations, resulting in a system that effectively corrects for spherical aberration, coma, and field curvature while keeping astigmatism within narrow limits.
