tldr: This article introduces a new type of portable voltaic battery with a high electromotive force of about two and three-quarter volts. The battery uses sodium as the electro-positive element and carbon, spongy platinum, copper, or other metallic gauze as the electro-negative element. The battery operates without a fluid, using atmospheric air impregnated with moisture to set up the action by providing sufficient moisture to wet the surface of the sodium. This thin film of moisture between the sodium and the electro-negative element results in a low internal resistance. The battery has various applications and can last for weeks depending on the size of the plates.
