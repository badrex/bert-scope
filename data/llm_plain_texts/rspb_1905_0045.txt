tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the factors that determine the phagocytosis of red blood-cells. They discovered that phagocytosis can occur even without the presence of agglutinin and amboceptor. A special substance in the serum, which can be withdrawn from the serum by red blood-cells, is responsible for this process. This substance is not the same as agglutinin or amboceptor and can be found in the serum of animals that have received injections of red blood-cells.
