tldr: Researchers discovered that the fly Glossina palpalis can transmit the Trypanosoma gambiense parasite, which causes sleeping sickness, even 50 days after feeding on an infected animal. The development of the parasite within the fly was found to be similar to its development in a test tube, with some flies remaining infective for the remainder of their lives. This study highlights the importance of understanding disease transmission and the role of insect vectors in spreading infections.
