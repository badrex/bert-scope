tldr: The author conducted experiments on animals to study the effects of nicotin on the nictitating membrane and pupil. They observed that nicotin abolishes most of the effects of stimulating the cervical sympathetic at nearly the same time. The differences in responses between animals are attributed to an unequal paralyzing action of nicotin on the nerve cells of the superior cervical ganglion.
