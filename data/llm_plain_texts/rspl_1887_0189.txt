tldr: The author examines the skeletal development of Apteryx, a flightless bird, and analyzes the cartilage in its bones. They observe that the fifth metatarsal disappears in Apteryx instead of fusing with the fourth, as in other birds. The study also identifies the centrale tarsi, a previously unrecognized element in bird anatomy. The author calls for more research and collaboration on this topic.
