tldr: 'This article discusses the comparative method in evolutionary biology and its application to understanding the evolution of reproductive strategies. By using phylogenies, researchers can identify independent instances of life-history evolution and determine the trade-offs and selective forces responsible for the diversification of life-history traits. The authors provide examples from various animal groups and demonstrate the importance of considering phylogenetic relatedness when analyzing life-history differences.'
