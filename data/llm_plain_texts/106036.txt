tldr: This article documents the meteorological observations and impacts of the 1770-1771 season in Lyndon, Rutland. The author, T. Barker, records the temperature, rainfall, and barometric pressure throughout the year, noting the severe frost and its effects on the local flora and crops. The winter of 1770-1771 caused significant damage to garden plants, trees, and furze, while the summer was cool and dry, resulting in small hay crops. The harvest was delayed and many crops were thin, with wheat and rye being particularly affected. The author also mentions the heavy rains and floods in some parts of Northumberland, Cumberland, and Durham during this time.
