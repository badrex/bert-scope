tldr: This article presents a study on the lattice spacings and phase boundaries of brass-type equilibrium in various alloy systems. The authors used high-temperature X-ray techniques to measure lattice spacings and analyzed the results to understand the behavior of different phases in these alloys. The findings provide insights into the factors influencing the equilibrium and the atomic volume changes in the alloys.
