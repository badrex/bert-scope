tldr: The author describes a new method for producing amides and nitriles using potassium sulphocyanate. They conducted experiments with various acids, such as acetic, isobutyric, and valeric acids, and found that the reaction produces different amides and nitriles. The main products include acetamide, diacetamide, isobutyronitrile, isobutyramide, valeronitrile, and valeramide. The author also discusses the reaction mechanisms and the formation of carbonic oxysulphide, carbonic anhydride, and sulphuretted hydrogen during the process.
