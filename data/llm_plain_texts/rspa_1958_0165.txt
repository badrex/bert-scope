tldr: The authors conducted experiments on superconducting tin and indium to study the resistance variation with frequency. They found that the resistance of superconducting tin and indium varies as the square of the frequency, as predicted by the two-fluid model. However, at higher frequencies, the resistance varies more slowly, indicating that the normal fluid's relaxation time may not be a Fermi gas. This research provides evidence against the theory of Schafroth and Blatt and contributes to a better understanding of superconductivity and material science.
