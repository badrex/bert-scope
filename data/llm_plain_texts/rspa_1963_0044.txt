tldr: The authors measured the magnetic moment of the proton by comparing the proton spin-resonance frequency with the electron cyclotron frequency in the same magnetic field. They found that the magnetic moment of the proton is equal to one Bohr magneton. This discovery helps to improve our understanding of the fundamental properties of the proton and its interactions with other particles.
