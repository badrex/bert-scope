tldr: This article presents evidence for the existence of defects in the structures of (Ca<SUB>x</SUB>Sr<SUB>1-x</SUB>)<SUB>n+1</SUB>Ti<SUB>n</SUB>0<SUB>3n+1</SUB> layer perovskites. The authors discuss the correlation between the chemistry and crystallography of these materials, as well as the progression from tetragonal to orthorhombic symmetry. They also examine the ordered structure of these materials and the presence of defects in their formation.
