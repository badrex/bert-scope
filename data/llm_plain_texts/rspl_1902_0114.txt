tldr: Sir Oliver Lodge and his team developed an improved coherer design for detecting Hertzian waves. The new coherer is a modification of Lord Rayleigh's mercury coherer and is more sensitive and reliable. It uses a rotating steel wheel touching a pool of mercury with a thin layer of oil in between. The wheel breaks the circuit instantly after a signal is detected, allowing for rapid signal reception. This design is considered trustworthy and effective in detecting Hertzian waves.
