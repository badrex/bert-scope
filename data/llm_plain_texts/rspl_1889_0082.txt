tldr: The author compares Sir George Shuckburgh's standard scale with the French metrical brass scale to determine the accuracy of the scale used in the measurement of the seconds pendulum. The comparison was conducted at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in Paris, and the results showed that the Shuckburgh scale had an error of not more than about 0.1 part or 1/100 inch.
