tldr: This article presents methods for numerically solving two non-linear integral equations that arise in a hydrodynamical problem related to papermaking. The authors provide numerical tables of the solutions and describe the methods used to compute them. They also analyze the asymptotic behavior of the solutions for large values of a parameter.
