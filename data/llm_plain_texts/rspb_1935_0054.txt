tldr: This article discusses the origin and relationship of the British flora, focusing on the Tertiary history and geological background. The authors explore the differences between early Tertiary floras and the present plant population of Britain, and the changes exhibited by successive floras in geographical relationship and composition. They also examine the effect of the Ice Age on plant survival and extinction, and the importance of reconstructing the geological background and botanical features of the series of floras preceding and subsequent to the Glacial period.
