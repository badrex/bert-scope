tldr: The author investigates the densities and coefficients of cubical expansion of various substances, including ice, hydrated salts, and solid carbonic acid, at low temperatures using liquid oxygen as a coolant. They discuss the importance of these findings in understanding the properties of substances at low temperatures and the potential for valuable deductions from further research in this area.
