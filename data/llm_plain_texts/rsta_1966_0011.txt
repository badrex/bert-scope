tldr: Researchers measured 60 heat flow values along nine profiles across the Mid-Indian Ocean Ridge and found that the average heat flow was normal. The correlation of high heat flow with the center of the ridge was less pronounced, and the cause for the low values on the flanks of the ridge remains unknown. A right lateral displacement of about 200 km across the Vema Trench was measured from the offset of the magnetic anomaly on the ridge crest. The study provides insights into the heat flow and magnetic profiles of the ocean floor, which can help in understanding the formation and evolution of mid-ocean ridges.
