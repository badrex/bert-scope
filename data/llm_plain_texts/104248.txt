tldr: This article presents three extraordinary surgical cases by Bezaleel Sherman. The first case involves the successful extraction of a large piece of the femur bone and the rapid healing of the thigh. The second case is about a patient with a foul ulcer in his mouth and a caries in the lower jawbone, who experienced jaw regeneration after taking a large amount of osteocolla. The third case is about a patient with a tumor in his buttock, which turned out to be a fish bone that had been swallowed a year prior and was removed successfully. All three patients are still living and can attest to the truth of the cases.
