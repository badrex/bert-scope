tldr: The authors studied the thermal decomposition of gaseous diethyl ether at high pressures. They found that the decomposition occurs in two ways, producing different primary products depending on the initial pressure. The reaction follows the unimolecular law, but the velocity constant varies with pressure, suggesting a reaction of a higher order than the first. The results indicate that the reaction is mainly homogeneous and not influenced by the presence of diluents.
