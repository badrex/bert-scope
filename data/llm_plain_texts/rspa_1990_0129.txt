tldr: The authors investigate the structural properties of diacyl peroxide/urea inclusion compounds using X-ray diffraction studies. They find that the guest species, diacyl peroxides, are closely packed within the host urea channels, with different domains of monoclinic guest structures related by rotation around the channel axis. The study has implications for understanding the structural constraints on guest species within inclusion environments and the measurement and interpretation of single-crystal X-ray diffraction patterns based on more than one three-dimensionally periodic reciprocal lattice.
