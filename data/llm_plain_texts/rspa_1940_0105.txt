tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the high-frequency resistance of superconducting tin and found that the resistance decreases when the temperature falls below the transition point. They explained this behavior based on the assumption of the simultaneous presence of normal and superconducting electrons. The results showed that the conductivity for high frequency is considerably lower than for low frequency at the temperature of liquid helium.
