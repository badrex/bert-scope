tldr: The authors propose a model that recognizes genetic links between almost all meteorites, based on processes active in the solar nebula. They identify key processes such as evaporation, recondensation, aggregation, compaction, heating events, and metasomatic exchange reactions. This model helps explain the chemical fractionations observed in meteoritic constituents and provides a unifying framework for understanding the origin and evolution of the solar system.
