tldr: The authors conducted experiments on mammalian nerve-muscle preparations to study the stimulus rhythm in reflex tetanic contractions. They discovered that the rhythm of the reflex tetanus corresponds with the stimulation frequency, and the upper limit of stimulus frequency for incomplete fusion of component reflex contractions varies for different types of reflexes. The findings suggest that the central nervous system plays a role in the operation of concurrent reflex excitation and inhibition, leading to algebraic summation of effects.
