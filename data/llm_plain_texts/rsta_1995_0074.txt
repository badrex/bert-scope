tldr: The authors analyze measurements of the Greenland Ice Sheet's specific mass balance and its sensitivity to climate change. They discuss the expected behavior of errors in satellite position and range measurements and consider the implications of these errors. The study finds that while some changes to the error calculation are required, they do not significantly alter the result. The authors conclude that the result is consistent with what is known and understood about the Greenland Ice Sheet.
