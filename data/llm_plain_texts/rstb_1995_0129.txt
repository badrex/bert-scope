tldr: This article reviews the evidence for locomotor mimicry in butterflies. It addresses the mislabelled axes in figures 2 and 3, correcting the x and y axes to 'centre of body mass (non-dimensional)' and 'centre of wing mass (non-dimensional)', respectively. The corrected data points reveal new insights into the relationship between body and wing mass in butterflies.
