tldr: The article discusses the challenges and potential interventions for managing indigenous natural enemies of aphids on field crops. It highlights the importance of raising the natural enemy:aphid ratio through habitat modifications, advancing the activity of natural enemies on the crop, reducing aphid multiplication with plant resistance, and using pesticides selectively. The unpredictability of natural enemies' impact on aphids is attributed to centuries of co-evolution, and strategies to improve biological control are proposed, such as direct augmentation, synomones and kairomones, and habitat modifications.
