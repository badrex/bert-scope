tldr: This article discusses the experiments conducted by William Crookes on the viscosity of gases at high exhaustions. The author found that the viscosity of a gas decreases as the pressure decreases, and that at very high vacuums, the viscosity falls off significantly. The results support Maxwell's theory that the mean free path of gas molecules should be considered when studying viscosity.
