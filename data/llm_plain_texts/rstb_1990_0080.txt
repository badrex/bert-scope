tldr: 'This study investigates the recent acidification history of Lilla Öresjön in southwest Sweden and its relation to the deposition of airborne pollutants and land-use changes. The sediment analysis reveals that water quality began to deteriorate in the 20th century, leading to an acute acidification phase in the 1960s. The change in diatom flora and the decline in inferred pH from 6.1 in the 19th century to 4.6 in the present suggest that the acidification and biological changes in the lake are closely related to the increased deposition of atmospheric pollutants from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes.'
