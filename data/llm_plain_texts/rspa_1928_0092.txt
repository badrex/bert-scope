tldr: This article discusses the investigation of diurnal magnetic variations and earth-air currents. The authors calculate line-integrals of the daily magnetic variation to examine the existence of vertical electric currents. They find that the results support the presence of diurnally varying earth-air currents, which could explain a significant part of the earth's magnetic field variations. The study also highlights the importance of further research and detailed magnetic surveys to reach a definitive conclusion on this topic.
