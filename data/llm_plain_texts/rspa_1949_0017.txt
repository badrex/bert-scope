revised_title: The Role of Diffusion in Flame Propagation
semantic_tags:

  - Flame propagation
  - Diffusion
  - Chemical reaction
  - Flame speed
tldr: The authors investigate the influence of diffusion on flame propagation and find that the diffusion of free atoms and radicals can account for flame propagation satisfactorily. They also discover that the flame speed is nearly independent of pressure. The study includes experiments with various hydrocarbon flames and analysis of the reaction zone's thickness and temperature distribution.
