tldr: The authors describe a thermal method for measuring the high-frequency inductive resistance of a low-resistance coil using two mercury coils. They discuss the challenges and techniques involved in obtaining accurate measurements, such as controlling the temperature and minimizing errors caused by parasitic currents. This method allows for the accurate measurement of high-frequency resistance without the need for large currents or complex equipment.
