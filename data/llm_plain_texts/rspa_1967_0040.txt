tldr: This article presents a calorimetric study of cyclotron resonance in copper. The authors observed cyclotron resonance masses with a sample whose surface lies in the plane and investigated the effect of tipping the magnetic field out of the surface. They also studied the effect of tipping on the line shapes near resonance and determined the amplitude of the oscillations with respect to the absorption in zero field. Finally, a large'shelf' in the absorption was observed at relatively low fields, which the authors attribute to retardation effects.
