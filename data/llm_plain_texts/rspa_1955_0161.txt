tldr: The authors conducted experiments on artificial sapphire crystals to study thermal conduction at low temperatures. They discovered that the conductivity of these crystals depends on their degree of perfection and the size of the specimens. The results showed that the conductivity reaches a maximum value, which is influenced by crystal imperfections and the dimensions of the specimens. This research helps to understand the behavior of thermal conduction in dielectric crystals and has potential applications in insulators and other materials.
