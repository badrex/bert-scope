tldr: In this article, the authors discuss their use of a 10 cm wavelength radar installed in a 46 ft radio telescope to observe Russian artificial earth satellites and their carrier rockets. They analyze the radar performance, radar signal strength, and radar parameters, and describe the methods of observation and the radar echoes obtained. The authors also discuss the capabilities of this radar in contributing to the research program of observations of earth satellites during the International Geophysical Year.
