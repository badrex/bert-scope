tldr: This article investigates the diffraction of elastic waves at the boundaries of a solid layer, specifically focusing on seismic waves. The authors explore the time of travel of indirect waves in the lower layer and the percentage of energy in these waves, which depends on the depth of the focus and the curvature of the wave-front of the primary distortional wave. The study has implications for understanding the behavior of seismic waves during earthquakes and for calculating the thickness of solid layers.
