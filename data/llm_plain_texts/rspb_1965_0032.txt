tldr: The study examines the effects of estrogenic hormone treatment on the structure and function of the mammalian testes. It shows that estrogen causes a decline in the number of spermatids and spermatocytes, while spermatogonia are less affected. The research also demonstrates that administering FSH and LH can restore normal conditions and that estrogen's effect on the testes is likely due to a deficiency of FSH. The study provides evidence of Sertoli cells metabolizing sterols during spermatogenesis.
