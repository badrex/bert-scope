tldr: The author discusses the physiological basis of thirst and its role in maintaining water balance in the human body. Thirst is an essential mechanism that ensures the body's water content is replenished, and it is closely related to hunger in driving our need for essential supplies. The sensation of thirst is primarily referred to the mouth and throat, and it serves as a defense against excessive water depletion.
