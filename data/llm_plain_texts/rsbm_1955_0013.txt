tldr: 'John Lennard-Jones was a renowned theoretical physicist and chemist who made significant contributions to the understanding of interatomic forces, molecular orbitals, and the solid state. He introduced the Lennard-Jones potential, which is still widely used today, and played a key role in establishing theoretical chemistry as a field of study. Lennard-Jones also made important discoveries in quantum mechanics, molecular orbitals, and the behavior of atoms and molecules adsorbed on surfaces.'
