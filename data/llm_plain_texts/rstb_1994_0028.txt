tldr: This article introduces spatial stochastic models, a type of mathematical model used to study ecological systems. It explains the basic concepts and principles of these models, focusing on their applications in understanding spatial patterns, dispersal, and interactions in ecological systems. The authors also discuss three influential examples from the ecological literature and demonstrate the power of these models in studying spatial ecological interactions.
