tldr: This article explores the distribution of barometric height frequency in various locations across the British Isles. The authors analyze data from meteorological stations and use generalised probability curves to understand the distribution patterns. They find that barometric frequency curves are not typically smooth and do not follow the normal distribution. The authors suggest that a more suitable type of curve can be used to describe the distribution of barometric frequency, which can help in understanding local weather patterns and improve meteorological observations.
