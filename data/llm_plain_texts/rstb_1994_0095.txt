tldr: The article discusses the role of self-assembly in biological systems, focusing on the iridescent colloidal sporopollenin found in Selaginella megaspore walls. The authors explain the mechanics of colloidal crystal formation and depletion attraction in the wall layers, and explore the self-assembly aspect of colloidal structures in biology. They also provide comparisons with Selaginella leaves and virus aggregates, and discuss the potential implications for evolution and entropy in organismal development.
