tldr: The authors discovered that rapid release of GTP within ventricular myocytes, in the absence of an agonist, causes the activation of L-type Ca2+ currents. This activation is due to the stimulation of adenylate cyclase and other GTP-dependent pathways, which increase the calcium current in the heart.
