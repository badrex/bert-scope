tldr: This article investigates the photolysis of ammonia and its effect on atomic hydrogen concentration. The authors conducted experiments using mercury-sensitized production and para-hydrogen conversion to measure the rate of hydrogen atom production. They found that the primary dissociation of ammonia is not as efficient as previously thought, and the products of ammonia decomposition do not remove hydrogen atoms abnormally quickly.
