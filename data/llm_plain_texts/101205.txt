tldr: In a letter to Dr. Croon, Richard Towneley discusses the invention of dividing a foot into thousands of parts for mathematical purposes by a fellow countryman, Mr. Gascoigne. Towneley reveals that Gascoigne had developed an instrument capable of taking precise angles and distances, which he used for astronomical observations, including calculating the moon's distance and parallax. The instrument was small, easy to use, and could be attached to telescopes, making it a valuable tool for astronomers of the time.
