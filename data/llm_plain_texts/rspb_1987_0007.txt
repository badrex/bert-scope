tldr: The authors investigated the possible functions of acetylcholine and an RFamide-like substance as transmitters in the chaetognath Sagitta. They found that acetylcholine may be the neuromuscular transmitter, and that many neurons containing RFamide-like material are associated with sensory organs and coordinating systems. This study provides insights into the physiology and nervous system of chaetognaths, which play an important role in marine food webs.
