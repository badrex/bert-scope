tldr: The authors provide a theoretical justification for the application of the Arrhenius equation to solid state reactions, mainly in ionic crystals. They focus on the role of the reactant-product interface and identify interface energy levels as precursors to bond redistribution steps. The authors argue that these interface energy levels, analogous to impurity levels, provide a basis for the exponential energy term in the Arrhenius equation, which is widely used in chemical kinetics.
