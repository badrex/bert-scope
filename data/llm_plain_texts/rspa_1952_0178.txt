tldr: The authors developed a method to estimate the ribosenucleic acid (RNA) content in isolated cell nuclei. They found that nuclei contain small amounts of RNA, but it's unclear if this RNA is originally from the nucleus or adsorbed from the cytoplasm during the isolation process. No correlation was found between the RNA content and the prominence of nucleolar systems.
