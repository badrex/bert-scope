tldr: The author, Anthony Carlisle, examines the unique muscular system and locomotion of fishes, comparing them to other animals. He describes the structure and function of fish muscles, fins, and the role of the tail in propulsion. Carlisle also discusses the effects of removing different parts of a fish on its ability to move and maintain balance. Additionally, he explores the shortness of fish muscles and their rapid action, as well as the adaptations for velocity and limited duration of action.
