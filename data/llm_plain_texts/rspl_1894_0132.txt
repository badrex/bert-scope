  - Newton's Rings
tldr: The author investigates electrical interference phenomena similar to Newton's rings, but exhibited by waves along wires. They describe experiments and mathematical theories to explain the behavior of these waves and their reflections, leading to a better understanding of the underlying principles and potential applications.
