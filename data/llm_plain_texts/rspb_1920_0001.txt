revised_title: 'The Impact of Nitrogen-Fixing Organisms and Nucleic Acid Derivatives on Plant Growth'
semantic_tags:
  - Plant growth

  - Bacterial contamination
tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the effect of nitrogen-fixing organisms and nucleic acid derivatives on plant growth. They discovered that adding Azotobacter chroococcum, a nitrogen-fixing bacterium, to the plant's culture solution significantly increased the rate of multiplication and size of the plants. They also found that nucleic acid derivatives from raw peat had a similar effect on plant growth. These findings suggest that bacterial contamination in water-culture experiments may also contribute to improved plant growth.
