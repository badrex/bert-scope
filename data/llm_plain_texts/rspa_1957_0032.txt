tldr: The authors used an optical method called Lipson's optical diffractometer to study the diffraction patterns of crystals with dislocations. They found that the intensity distribution around ideal reciprocal lattice points is complex, but for certain points, it is in agreement with Suzuki's theory. The study also revealed that the diffraction patterns from crystals with various arrays of dislocations can be determined using the optical method.
