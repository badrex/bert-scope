tldr: This article investigates the rates at which methyl halides (methyl chloride, methyl bromide, and methyl iodide) react with hydroxyl and thiosulphate ions in water. The study discusses the energy of activation for these reactions and explores the relationship between the energy and the electrical moment of the polar group involved. The findings contribute to the understanding of the kinetics of reactions between ions and polar molecules in solution.
