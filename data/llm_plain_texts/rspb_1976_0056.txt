tldr: The author studied the ultrastructure and color of the wing scales of Papilio zalmoxis using scanning electron microscopy and spectrophotometry. They discovered that the blue color in the butterfly's scales is mainly of structural origin, due to Tyndall scattering by air-filled alveoli and thin film interference in a basement lamella. This unique coloration is different from the typical multilayer colors found in butterflies and has not been observed in adult Lepidoptera before.
