tldr: 'John Tyndall conducted experiments to study the effect of aqueous vapour on terrestrial radiation. He found that the difference in temperature between the earth's surface and the air above it varies depending on the presence of aqueous vapour. This invisible constituent of the atmosphere can arrest the invisible heat of the earth, leading to variations in the waste of heat from the earth. Tyndall's observations support the idea that the action of aqueous vapour plays a significant role in the earth's temperature regulation.'
