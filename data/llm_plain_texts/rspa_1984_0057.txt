tldr: This study investigates the process of hydrogen absorption and hydridization in lanthanide films, specifically Gd, Dy, Er, and Lu. The researchers found that clean films absorb hydrogen rapidly and stabilize as dihydrides, with interstitial hydrogen. They also discovered a correlation between the catalytic rate and the sublimation energy of the metal, which could have implications for understanding the behavior of other rare earth metals.
