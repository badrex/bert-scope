revised_title: 'The Efficiency and Survival Value of Modes of Dispersal in Plants'
semantic_tags:
  - Plant dispersal

  - Wind dispersal
  - Animal-assisted dispersal
  - Plant reproduction
tldr: The author discusses the efficiency and survival value of different modes of plant dispersal, such as wind, water, and animal-assisted dispersal. Wind dispersal is found to be the most wasteful, while animal-assisted dispersal is more selective and efficient. The author also highlights the importance of considering the reproductive capacity and habitat requirements of a species when evaluating the effectiveness of dispersal methods.
