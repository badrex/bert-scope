tldr: The authors conducted a series of laboratory-scale mechanical tests on two grades of mild steel to study the effects of test variables such as size, stress state, and strain rate on brittle fracture behavior. They found that decreasing the size of the test pieces in slow notch bending can decrease the ductile-brittle transition temperature by 100 degrees Celsius. The results show that there is no direct relation between the energy transition temperature and the lower temperature load transition, making it difficult to interpret brittle fracture data from laboratory-scale testing and apply it to large structures.
