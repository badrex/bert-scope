tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the line spectrum of chlorine in the ultra-violet region. They used various techniques to eliminate impurities and measured over 200 lines between wavelengths 3354 and 2070 A. The study provides a better understanding of chlorine's spectrum and its interactions with other elements.
