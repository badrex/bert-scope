tldr: This study investigates the influence of pressure on the spontaneous ignition of inflammable gas-air mixtures, specifically hexane and isobutane-air mixtures. The authors found that ignition points for these mixtures lie in two distinct temperature ranges, with the lower range favored by high pressure and the higher range by low pressure. The results support the view that the lower group of ignition points is due to the survival and rapid oxidation of intermediate bodies, while the higher group results from ignitions of products of their thermal decompositions. The addition of 0.05% lead tetraethyl raises ignition points in a limited pressure range just above the critical transition pressures.
