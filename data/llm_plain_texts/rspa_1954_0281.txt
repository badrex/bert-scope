tldr: This study investigates the combustion of methane at high temperatures, focusing on the reaction kinetics. The authors found that the reaction is little influenced by surface, is retarded by methane, and accelerated by oxygen. The reaction proceeds via formaldehyde and carbon monoxide, with the further oxidation of carbon monoxide being inhibited by formaldehyde or its oxidation products. The results provide insights into the conditions for the rapid reaction of methane-air mixtures with hydrocarbon contents of up to 5%.
