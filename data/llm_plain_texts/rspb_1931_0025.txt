semantic_tags:
  - Amino acids
  - Quinoline derivatives
  - Antiseptic compounds
  - Trypanocidal properties
  - Antimalarial action
tldr: The authors synthesized various aliphatic and aromatic amino derivatives of \#x3B1;-quinoline methiodide and tested their antiseptic, trypanocidal, and antimalarial properties. While some compounds showed potential, none exhibited significant activity, and the study provides a summary of the synthesis and results obtained.
