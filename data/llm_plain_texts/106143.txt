tldr: The author conducted an experiment in which they placed plants in a hot house and outside, passing branches through windows to compare their growth. The results showed that the branches inside the hot house thrived while those outside did not, suggesting that the circulation of sap in plants is not the same as the circulation of blood in animals. This also led to the observation that preventing the natural fall of petals and stamens in flowers can increase the chances of fructification.
