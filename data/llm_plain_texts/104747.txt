tldr: 'In this letter, Mr. Henry Baker describes an earthquake experienced in Winbourn, Dorsetshire, and Taunton, Somersetshire. He shares the accounts of people who felt the shock, which was heard 20 miles around Winbourne. Baker suggests that such events may happen more frequently than commonly supposed, as people in rural areas often overlook them unless significant damage occurs.'
