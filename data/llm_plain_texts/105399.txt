tldr: The author examines the Bovey coal, a type of fossil fuel found in Devonshire, and its various properties. The coal is found in layers up to 70 feet deep and comes in different forms, such as wood coal and stone coal. The author also discusses its uses, such as baking earthenware and burning limestone, and its potential for use in fire-engines. The coal's mineral origin is confirmed by its lack of electrical attraction and its formation in layers unlike fossil wood.
