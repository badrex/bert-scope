tldr: The study investigates the development of the tail and excretory system in the cercaria of Cryptocotyle lingua, a parasitic flatworm. The tail develops within the redia and molluscan host, with epidermal cell bodies and striated caudal muscles forming the tail's structure. The excretory system includes a secondary excretory pore, which forms at the posterior end of the body. The tail is shed when the cercaria contacts its fish intermediate host, and the tail's function as an organ of propulsion is accomplished.
