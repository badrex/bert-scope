tldr: This study investigates the distribution of neuropeptides in the nervous system of the brittle star Ophiura ophiura using immunocytochemical methods. The research focuses on the radial nerve cord and circumoral ring, revealing abundant neuropeptide-like immunoreactivity in the ectoneural tissue. The findings show that there are distinct populations of neurons organized in a similar pattern in each segment, with some differences at the junction with the ring. The study provides evidence of two distinct neuropeptides in the brittle star's nervous system.
