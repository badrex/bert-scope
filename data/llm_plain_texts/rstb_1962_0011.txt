tldr: This article examines chalky rocks from the upper reaches of the continental slope in the Western Approaches of the English Channel. The rocks, which are dated from Middle Eocene to Upper Miocene, indicate that the continental slope has not retained much clastic sediment of recent geological time. The chalky rocks are similar to Upper Cretaceous chalk but are much younger. The presence of these rocks on the continental slope challenges the idea that the slope is a dumping ground for unconsolidated sediments.
