tldr: The author, Augustus Matthiessen, and his colleague C. R. A. Wright, researched the chemical composition of opium bases, specifically morphine. They discovered a new base, apomorphine, by treating morphine with hydrochloric acid. Apomorphine is a non-irritant emetic and powerful antistimulant, which may have potential medical applications. The researchers also found that apomorphine can be formed by heating morphine with dilute sulfuric acid.
