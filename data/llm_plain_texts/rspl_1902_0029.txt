tldr: The author, Jagadis Chunder Bose, investigates the electromotive wave that accompanies mechanical disturbance in metals in contact with electrolytes. He demonstrates that a wave of electric disturbance occurs when a metal rod is struck, causing a response on a galvanometer. The author also explores the effects of varying the stimulus, molecular conditions, and the use of chemical reagents on the response.
