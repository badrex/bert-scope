tldr: This article discusses the processes of recombination and attachment in the upper atmosphere, focusing on the rate of radiative recombination of electrons with upper atmospheric positive ions. The authors explore the role of direct electron recombination and the cross-section for continuous absorption of radiation by oxygen atoms, which can be useful in understanding the formation of ionized layers by solar radiation and in astrophysics.
