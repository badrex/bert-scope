tldr: This study investigates how embryonic chick motoneurons navigate and form connections in experimentally altered environments. The researchers found that when motoneurons are displaced, they can respond to environmental cues and adjust their pathways to reach their appropriate targets. However, when displaced too far, they may form incorrect or aberrant connections. The findings suggest that the cues motoneurons respond to may be local or limited to specific subclasses of motoneurons.
