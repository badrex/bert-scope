tldr: The author, T. P. Anderson Stuart, conducted extensive research and experiments to discover a membrane lining the fossa patellaris of the corpus vitreum. This membrane, which was previously disputed by other scientists, was found to be present in various animal eyes. The author provides detailed descriptions and evidence of the membrane's existence, including chemical, optical, and mechanical tests, and explains its significance in eye anatomy.
