tldr: This article discusses new conservation laws for zero rest-mass fields in asymptotically flat space-time, focusing on gravitational waves. The author analyzes these laws in Einstein's theory and the Maxwell and linearized Einstein theories, discovering that a stationary asymptotically flat gravitational field cannot become radiative and then stationary again after a finite time, except possibly if a certain quadratic combination of multipole moments returns to its original value. This indicates the existence of 'tails' to the outgoing waves, which destroys the stationary nature of the final field.
