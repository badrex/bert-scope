tldr: This article investigates fluid expulsion and diagenetic carbonate deposition in subduction zones, specifically in the Cascadia accretionary prism off Oregon. The authors find that fluid expulsion occurs due to compaction and cementation of methane-rich pore waters, and that the extent and position of carbonate deposits on the accretionary prism indicate the magnitude and structural control of past fluid expulsion. The study provides insights into the processes occurring in subduction zones and the role of fluids in shaping these environments.
