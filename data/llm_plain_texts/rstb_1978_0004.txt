tldr: The author reexamines the extinct beaver Trogontherium, studying its evolutionary lineage, size changes, and taxonomy. Contrary to previous beliefs, the author concludes that all Trogontherium material belongs to a single evolutionary lineage that increased in size during the Pliocene and Pleistocene. The author also reviews the animal's ecology and habits, suggesting that they were similar to those of the living coypu (Myocastor coypus).
