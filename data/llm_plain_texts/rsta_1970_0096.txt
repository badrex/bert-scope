tldr: 'The author discusses the analysis of pottery from the Mycenaean period using optical emission spectroscopy. This method helps identify the origins and sources of Mycenaean pottery, including distinguishing between Minoan and Mycenaean pottery, identifying the production centers, and tracing the distribution of pottery across various regions. The study provides valuable insights into the economic exchanges and cultural interactions of the time.'
