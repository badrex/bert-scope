  - Spheroids
  - Centrifugal force
tldr: The author investigates the conditions of equilibrium for an incompressible fluid subjected to accelerating forces. They explore the figure of equilibrium and the distribution of pressures within the fluid, leading to the concept of level surfaces and the central point, where pressures are balanced and equal in all directions.
