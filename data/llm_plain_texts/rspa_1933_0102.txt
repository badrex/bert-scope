tldr: The authors studied the thermal decomposition of acetaldehyde and found that it involves multiple quasi-unimolecular reactions with different pressure ranges. The reaction kinetics were analyzed, revealing a complex behavior that challenges the traditional classification of reactions as unimolecular or bimolecular. This research has implications for understanding the distribution of activation energy among molecular vibrations and the behavior of molecules with more than two atoms.
