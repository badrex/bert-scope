tldr: The authors studied the resistance of Bact. lactis aerogenes to proflavine and tested the applicability of the statistical fluctuation test. They found that the variation in resistance was greater between samples from different cultures than from the same culture. They investigated the effects of factors like age, pH, and aeration on the number of resistant survivors. The study showed that varying aeration efficiency had a significant impact on resistance, and the variation in colony numbers could be due to survival rather than mutation. The results were not consistent with a simple mutation hypothesis.
