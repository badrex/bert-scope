tldr: This study investigates atomic collision sequences in crystals of copper, silver, and gold using energetic ion beams. The experiments reveal that atoms are ejected from crystal surfaces along low-index crystal directions, indicating the presence of focused atomic collision sequences. The findings are interpreted as a result of three types of focused collision sequences, with the second and third types traveling along specific crystal directions. The research provides insights into the mechanisms of radiation damage and sputtering in metals.
