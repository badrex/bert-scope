tldr: The article discusses the role of Ras proteins and phosphatidylinositol 3' kinase in cell signaling pathways. Ras proteins are involved in controlling cellular proliferation, morphology, and differentiation. The author explains how Ras can activate the MAP kinase pathway and also interact with phosphatidylinositol 3' kinase, which may be important for controlling cellular morphology through the actin cytoskeleton and DNA synthesis.
