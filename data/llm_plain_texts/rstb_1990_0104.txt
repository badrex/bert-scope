tldr: The article describes the structure and organization of the nervous system in the actinotroch larva of Phoronis vancouverensis. The central element of the system is the apical organ, and nerve cell bodies were found only in this area and the surrounding apical epithelium. The larval nervous system is highly centralized, and the largest nerve in the body is the primary hood nerve, which plays a role in neuromuscular control. The article also discusses the comparative and phylogenetic implications of the findings.
