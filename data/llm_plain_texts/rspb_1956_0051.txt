tldr: The study examines the interaction between Bacterium coli and phenol, focusing on the zeta potentials of the cells and the effect of electrolytes on the toxicity of phenol. The results support the idea that death of the organism in phenol is due to a lytic process, and the presence of electrolytes can retard the action of phenol without affecting the final zeta potential change.
