tldr: This article discusses the energy balance and deformation mechanisms of thrust sheets, focusing on the McConnell thrust in the Canadian Rockies. The author calculates the mechanical energy consumed in the emplacement of a thrust sheet and identifies where this energy is dissipated. The study also presents ideas on how the thrust fracture surface arises and how the energy balance can be used to understand the processes involved in the deformation of thrust sheets.
