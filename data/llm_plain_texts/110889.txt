tldr: The author, Robert Rigg, conducted an experiment with two mice to study the formation of alkaline and earthy bodies in animals. He found that the weight of ashes in the mice's excretions was greater than the weight of ashes in their food, indicating that animals form these substances through their metabolism and excrete them.
