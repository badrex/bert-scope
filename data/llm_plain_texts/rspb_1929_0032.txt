tldr: The authors investigate the properties of hemochromogen, a compound found in various organisms, and its reactions with nitrogen compounds. They discover that two molecules of nitrogen compounds are required to form hemochromogen and that these compounds can be replaced by carbon monoxide. The study provides insights into the structure and behavior of hemochromogen and its potential applications in understanding biological processes.
