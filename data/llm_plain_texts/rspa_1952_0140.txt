tldr: This article investigates the creep behavior of metals under interrupted stressing, specifically focusing on the effect of stress pulses on the material's deformation. The authors develop a method to analyze the creep curve and demonstrate that the effect of interruptions can be expressed in terms of a single parameter. The study has implications for understanding the behavior of materials under stress and can be applied to various engineering and technological applications.
