tldr: The author, A. Matthiessen, investigates the electric conducting power of copper and its alloys. They found that pure copper conducts better than any of the alloys and that the differences in conducting power are due to impurities and the fusion process. The study also confirms the influence of trace amounts of foreign metals on the conducting power of copper.
