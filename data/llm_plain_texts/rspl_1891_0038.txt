tldr: The author examines the morphology of spore-producing members in Lycopodinse and Ophioglossacese plants, focusing on their development and structure. They compare the sporangia of these plants to better understand the transition from simpler to more complex forms in vascular plants. The study provides insights into the evolution of these plants and their reproductive structures.
