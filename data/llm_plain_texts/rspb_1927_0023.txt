tldr: The author demonstrates the transformation of the Golgi apparatus in tissue culture cells. They show that the Golgi apparatus changes form as cells spread out on the surface of the cover-glass. The transformation involves the stretching and dispersal of the Golgi material, which can eventually lead to the formation of fatty or lipoidal droplets. This research provides insight into the behavior of the Golgi apparatus in altered cellular conditions.
