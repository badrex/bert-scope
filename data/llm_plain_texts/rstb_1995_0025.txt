tldr: This study examines the relationship between species diversity and ecosystem processes in a series of terrestrial mesocosms. By manipulating the number of plant and animal species within each trophic level, the researchers found that ecosystem processes such as community respiration, productivity, decomposition, nutrient retention, and water retention were affected by the loss of species. The results provide empirical evidence that declining species diversity may alter the performance of terrestrial ecosystems.
