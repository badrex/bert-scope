tldr: The authors present a method to calculate fractional parentage coefficients explicitly, which are essential for evaluating interaction elements between states in atomic and nuclear structure calculations. They introduce an operator that picks out antisymmetric states and split the coefficients into orbital and spin parts. The authors provide detailed results for three, four, and five particles cases.
