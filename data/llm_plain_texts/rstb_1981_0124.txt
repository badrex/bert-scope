tldr: This article discusses the optimization of bioactivity in crop protection chemicals through the use of quantitative structure-activity relations (QSAR). The authors focus on the importance of electronic, hydrophobic, and steric substituent constants in modulating bioactivity in a congeneric series. They review the state of the art of these parameters and their applications, emphasizing recent developments in steric parameters. The article provides examples of QSAR studies on various crop protection chemicals, highlighting the significance of lead optimization in the design of these chemicals.
