tldr: The crystal structure of deuterated benzene has been refined by single-crystal neutron diffraction analysis at 15 and 123 K. The unit-cell dimensions were also measured at 52.6 and 80, and the thermal-expansion coefficients at all four temperatures were calculated. The molecules have a small chair-distortion, and ab initio molecular orbital calculations agree with the corrected values from the crystal structure within experimental errors.
