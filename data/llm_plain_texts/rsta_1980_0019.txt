tldr: 'The article discusses the evolution of passive continental margins in the Atlantic Ocean, focusing on the Mesozoic palaeo-oceanography of rifted margins. Recent deep drilling results have improved understanding of the Atlantic's evolution since the Late Jurassic. The central north Atlantic was a deep basin bordered by carbonate platforms and connected to the world ocean. With the partial opening of the south Atlantic, the central and south Atlantic turned into isolated and possibly stagnant troughs. During the Late Cretaceous, inter-basin deep-water circulation likely began to develop, and the Cainozoic saw the establishment of full deep-water circulation with connections to the rest of the world ocean.'
