tldr: The authors studied the exchange reactions between deuterium and hydrogen halides, focusing on hydrogen chloride. They found that both bimolecular and atomic chain mechanisms were involved in the reaction. The results led to a consistent mechanism from which the rates of elementary reactions could be derived and compared with theoretical calculations.
