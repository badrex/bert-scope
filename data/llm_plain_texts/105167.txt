tldr: 'John Canton conducted various experiments to study electricity and its effects on objects. He discovered that when cork balls are suspended by threads and exposed to an electrical charge, they repel each other. He also observed that the electrical charge in the atmosphere can be positive or negative, and that this charge can be influenced by thunderclouds. These findings contributed to the understanding of electricity and its role in thunderstorms.'
