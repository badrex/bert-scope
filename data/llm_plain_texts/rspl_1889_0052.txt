tldr: The author investigates the tubercles on the roots of leguminous plants, specifically focusing on peas and beans. They discovered that these tubercles are formed by infection from other tubercles and are filled with living "bacteroids" or "gemmules." The author also found that these bacteroids can infect both peas and beans, suggesting a close symbiotic relationship between the tubercles and the plants. The study provides insights into the infection process and the role of tubercles in the leguminous plant's economy.
