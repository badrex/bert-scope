tldr: The article discusses the dynamics of continental shelf sea circulation, focusing on shelf circulation cells and the role of pressure gradients in driving these cells. The boundary layer theory of shelf circulation is reviewed, and the authors examine how this theory can explain the observed coastal sea-level variations and nearshore current patterns.
