tldr: The author investigates the differential invariants of space and surfaces, focusing on the most general solution of the partial differential equations associated with these invariants. The study involves constructing explicit expressions for invariants up to the third order and interpreting their geometric significance. The author also discusses the discrepancies in the spectrum of radium observed by various researchers.
