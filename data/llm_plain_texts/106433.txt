tldr: The author investigates the precession of equinoxes caused by the Sun's attraction on the Earth. They explain that the precession occurs due to the unequal actions of the Sun and Moon on the Earth's equator, and that the precession will be different depending on whether the Earth is considered fluid or solid. The author provides a mathematical explanation for the precession and discusses the implications for understanding the Earth's rotation and the motion of celestial bodies.
