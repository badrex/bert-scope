tldr: The authors studied the effect of sinusoidal length changes on a beetle flight muscle to understand the properties of insect fibrillar muscle. They used a high-impedance mechanical drive to impose sinusoidal length changes and observed the resulting sinusoidal changes of tension. The results showed that the resting muscle can be represented by a visco-elastic model, and the stimulated muscle behaves with a time delay between length changes and tension changes. The study provides insights into the mechanism of the rhythmic activity of insect fibrillar muscle.
