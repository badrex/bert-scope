tldr: The article discusses the molecular biology of cell locomotion, focusing on proteins involved in the attachment of actin to the plasma membrane. It explores the roles of proteins such as a-actinin, vinculin, and fimbrin in the attachment and stabilization of actin filaments in adhesion plaques. The discovery of a new protein, 215k, suggests that more proteins remain to be identified in this region. The article also considers proteins involved in the attachment of actin to other regions of the plasma membrane.
