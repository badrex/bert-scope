tldr: The author investigates the contribution of friction stress to the creep behavior of a nickel-base in situ composite. They analyze the transient creep following stress reductions and determine the friction stress as a function of temperature and directional solidification conditions. The results provide evidence for the operation of recovery-creep in both the composite and matrix alloys, and the friction stress and flow stress are found to be influenced by the matrix behavior and microstructure.
