tldr: The authors measured the extinction coefficients of hydrogen iodide and calculated the approximate course of the upper potential energy curve using the eigenfunction of the ground state. The results support the dissociation into normal atoms and highlight the challenges of extrapolating absorption thresholds to determine heats of dissociation.
