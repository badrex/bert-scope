tldr: In this paper, Michael Faraday describes his experimental research on electricity, focusing on electromagnetic induction and the electro-tonic state. He demonstrates that electric currents can induce similar currents in nearby wires, and that these induced currents can be influenced by magnets. Faraday also discovers that when a conductor is subjected to either voltaic or magneto-electric induction, it enters a unique state he calls the "electro-tonic state." Additionally, he explains that when a piece of metal moves in a specific direction near a magnetic pole, electrical currents are generated within the metal. This discovery helps clarify the phenomena observed in experiments by Arago and others, which were previously attributed to simple magnetic induction.
