semantic_tags:
  - Particle Physics
  - Quantum Numbers
  - Leptons
  - Gauge Theories
  - Anomalies in Physics
tldr: This article discusses the theoretical reasons for introducing heavy leptons, their classification, and how to differentiate between them. It also explores the decay processes of these heavy leptons and their production methods. The article highlights the importance of understanding heavy leptons in the context of unified renormalizable theories of weak and electromagnetic interactions.
