tldr: This study examines the geometry of arterial curvature and branching using magnetic resonance imaging techniques. It finds that the geometry is commonly non-planar and that small values of non-planar parameters significantly affect the velocity distribution. The research also reveals a distinctive flow pattern associated with non-planar curvature and branching of arteries, which may have implications for vascular biology and disease susceptibility.
