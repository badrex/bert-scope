tldr: The authors study the interaction between kinks and elastic waves in isotropic media. They treat a kink as a 'point defect' with a certain mass, constrained to move along a line and subject to a radiation reaction. They calculate the rate at which an oscillating kink radiates energy into the medium and find that the kink has a ring cross-section for elastic waves proportional to the square of its width. The kink moving through an isotropic flux of elastic waves experiences a retarding force proportional to the product of its velocity and the energy density of the waves.
