tldr: In 1714, Dr. Edmund Halley observed the total solar eclipse of April 22 from London on behalf of the Royal Society. He used a large quadrant and a pendulum clock to measure the eclipse's duration and the Sun's position. Halley noted the change in the sky's color during the eclipse and the appearance of a luminous ring around the Moon. He also recorded the limited visibility of stars during the eclipse and the diffused light in the surrounding atmosphere.
