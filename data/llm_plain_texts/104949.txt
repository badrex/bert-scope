tldr: The author, Stephen Hales, explores methods to cure the ill taste of milk caused by cows' diets and to sweeten stinking water. He discovers that heating milk to a scalding temperature and ventilating it effectively removes the ill taste. Hales also suggests a stove system to heat milk without imparting a smoky taste. The author's experiments show that ventilating stinking water can improve its smell and taste.
