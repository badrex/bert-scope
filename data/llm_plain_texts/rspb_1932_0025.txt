tldr: This study examines the distribution of phosphagens in various invertebrates and their role in muscle contraction. The authors investigate the presence of creatine phosphate in Vertebrates and arginine phosphate in Invertebrates, challenging the previously held belief that these compounds are exclusive to their respective groups. The research also explores the existence of phosphagen in different invertebrate types, such as tunicates, sea squirts, and Hemichorda, which have not been thoroughly examined before.
