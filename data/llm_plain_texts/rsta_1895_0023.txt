tldr: This article presents theorems on the attraction of ellipsoids for various laws of force other than the inverse square. It explores the potential of thin homogeneous and heterogeneous homoeoids, ellipsoidal shells, and solid ellipsoids under different force laws. The author provides mathematical expressions and integrals for calculating the potential and force at internal and external points of these shapes.
