tldr: This article discusses the flow properties of rocks at crustal conditions and how they are influenced by factors such as temperature, strain rate, and stress differences. The author infers that large-scale ductile deformation in the Earth's crust is governed by secondary creep, which involves plastic deformation resulting from dislocation motion and diffusion. The article also compares the flow properties of various rocks, such as ice, halite, marble, dolomite, quartzite, and dunite, under different conditions.
