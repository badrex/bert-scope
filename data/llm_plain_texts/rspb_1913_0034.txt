tldr: The author conducted experiments to investigate the physiological activity of Bacillus coli in soils. They discovered that the presence of Bacillus coli in soil allowed the soil to retain moisture for an extended period, even without further water addition. This phenomenon is attributed to the slime-producing ability of the bacteria, which may also explain the slime-forming power of other soil organisms like nodule bacteria.
