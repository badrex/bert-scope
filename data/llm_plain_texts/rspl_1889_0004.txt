tldr: The author, J. Norman Lockyer, investigates the wave-length of the chief fluting seen in the spectrum of manganese. They compare the manganese fluting with the aurora line and find that the wave-length of the most refrangible edge of the fluting is about 5576. This research contributes to understanding the relationship between the spectra of meteorites, meteor swarms, stars, comets, and aurorae.
