tldr: The author, Martin Barry, discusses his research on embryology and the correspondence between structures connected with the mammiferous ovum and other ova. He presents findings from his previous papers published in Philosophical Transactions and shares observations made by other researchers. Barry concludes that the expelled and lost ovisac in mammals corresponds to the shell-membrane in birds, and that the albuminous contents of the ovisac in mammals correspond to the albumen in birds' eggs.
