tldr: The authors studied the magnetic anisotropy of naphthalene crystals and found that they have a high degree of magnetic and optical anisotropy. They determined the orientation of the molecules in the crystal lattice and measured the susceptibility of the crystals in different directions. The results showed that the magnetic anisotropy of naphthalene crystals is connected with the structure of the individual molecules.
