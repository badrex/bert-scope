revised_title: 'Influence of Air on Carbon Dioxide and Lactic Acid Changes in Potato Tubers Following Anaerobic Conditions'

  - Plant metabolism
  - Anaerobic respiration
  - Lactic acid
  - Carbon dioxide production
  - Potato tubers
tldr: The authors conducted experiments on potato tubers to study the effects of air on carbon dioxide and lactic acid changes following anaerobic conditions. They discovered that when potato tubers are exposed to air after a period of anaerobiosis, there is an increase in carbon dioxide production and a rapid disappearance of accumulated lactic acid. This study helps to understand the metabolic processes in plant tissues under different conditions.
