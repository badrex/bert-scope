tldr: The author observed and recorded the solar eclipse at Oxford on December 22, 1870. They used a unique method to measure the cusps and the moon's center during the eclipse. The author also noted the influence of solar and sky radiation on temperature readings during the event. This method could potentially be useful in other astronomical observations.
