tldr: The author, Lionel S. Beale, describes the development of a new object-glass for microscopes with a magnifying power double that of any previously made. This new fiftieth object-glass allows for the examination of even smaller and more transparent particles, which can aid in studying the development and increase of some of the lowest organisms. Additionally, the high magnification power helps in investigating delicate structures in nervous organs and tracing nerve fibers in various tissues.
