tldr: This study investigates the flight mechanics of nine different species of petrels and albatrosses in South Georgia. The researchers found that all species rely on pelagic flight for foraging, and their flight mechanics vary based on their body mass. Larger species have longer wings and flap less frequently, while smaller species flap more often. The study also highlights the importance of energy conservation in these birds' flight mechanics, as they need to travel long distances to find food for breeding.
