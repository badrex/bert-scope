tldr: The authors created two mutant haemoglobin proteins, Hb Nympheas and Hb Daphne, using site-directed mutagenesis. They studied the oxygen-binding properties of these mutants and found that the Cys-93(3^Ser mutation in Hb Nympheas slightly increased oxygen affinity and reduced co-operativity, while Hb Daphne (Cys-93(3^Ser, His-143(3^Arg) showed high oxygen affinity and reduced co-operativity. These findings provide insights into the mechanism of allosteric control, folding, and molecular evolution of haemoglobin.
