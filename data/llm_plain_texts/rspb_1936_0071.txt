tldr: 'This study investigates the total fat content of developing salmon eggs, focusing on the fat content of the embryonic system, yolks, and embryos. The research found that the fat content decreases throughout development, with 61.9% of the initial fat being lost as energy for metabolic processes. The study also confirms the synthesis of fat in early embryology, a phenomenon observed in various forms.'
