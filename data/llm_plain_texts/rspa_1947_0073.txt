tldr: The authors investigate the impact of lateral turbulence on the diffusion of vapor in the lower atmosphere, specifically focusing on a saturated area of parabolic shape. They propose an empirical formula for lateral diffusivity, which, when combined with existing expressions for normal diffusivity and wind speed, provides a practical model for the lower atmosphere. This model helps estimate the effects of neglecting lateral dispersion and offers a comparison with experimental results.
