tldr: The authors discovered that deep-sea sharks maintain near-neutral buoyancy by regulating the oil content in their livers. This unique composition of liver oil provides the necessary buoyancy for these sharks to float effortlessly in deep-sea environments. The findings highlight the importance of liver oil in maintaining balance and survival for these deep-sea creatures.
