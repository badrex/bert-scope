tldr: This article examines the dentition and mandible of the Thylacoleo Carnifex, a prehistoric Australian marsupial, and challenges the arguments for its herbivory. The author, Professor Owen, analyzes the structure and position of the teeth and sockets, concluding that the Thylacoleo Carnifex had carnivorous features, contrary to previous assumptions. This study provides valuable insights into the understanding of the habits and affinities of this prehistoric mammal.
