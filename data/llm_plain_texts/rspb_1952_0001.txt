tldr: The author discusses the biochemical and physiological aspects of fluoroacetic acid, a strong poison and vesicant. They explain how fluoroacetic acid becomes lethal when transformed by the action of tissue enzymes, making it a unique example of 'lethal synthesis.' The author also explores the connection between pharmacology and enzymes, as well as the effects of fluoroacetic acid on the pyruvate oxidase system.
