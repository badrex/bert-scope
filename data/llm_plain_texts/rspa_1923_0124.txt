tldr: This article explores the discontinuity of the hydration process in various substances, including salts and textiles. The authors discovered that hydration occurs in a series of discontinuous steps, with changes in rate happening frequently. They also found that the process can be accurately expressed mathematically using simple equations, with time measured from the starting point. This research sheds light on the complex nature of hydration and its implications for various industries.
