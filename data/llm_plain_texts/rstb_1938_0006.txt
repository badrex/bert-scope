tldr: This study investigates the post-glacial history of British vegetation by examining the origin and stratigraphy of Fenland deposits near Woodwalton, Hunts, and southern Fenland. The research focuses on the complex history of climatic alteration, marine transgression and regression, and vegetational evolution in the fenland basin of East Anglia. The authors use a combination of fieldwork, laboratory analysis, and pollen analysis to understand the changes in the area's vegetation and environment over time.
