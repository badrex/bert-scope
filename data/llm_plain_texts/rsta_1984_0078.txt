tldr: This article discusses the evolution of rotation in the early history of the Solar System, focusing on various theories and mechanisms that explain the slow rotation of the Sun. The authors analyze different processes, such as magnetic fields and mass loss due to solar wind, to understand how the Sun's rotation and the distribution of angular momentum in the Solar System were shaped.
