tldr: The author investigates the eigenfunctions of Laplace's tidal equations for a thin, rotating fluid sphere. They discover that the solutions can be classified into two classes of waves and provide approximations for these solutions. The study has implications for ocean and atmospheric sciences, as it helps understand the behavior of tides and weather patterns.
