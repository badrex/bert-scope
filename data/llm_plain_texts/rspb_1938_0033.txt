tldr: The study investigates the structure of the walls in parenchyma cells of Avena coleoptiles and the orientation of cellulose within them. The researchers found that the major extinction position of the walls is inclined, and the orientation of cellulose chains in the primary walls of these cells is not transverse as previously suggested. This discovery provides new insights into plant cell wall development and growth.
