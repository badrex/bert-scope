tldr: In this article, Dr. and Mrs. Huggins discuss their observations of the spectrum of Nova Aurigae, a rare celestial event where a star transforms into a nebula. They discovered that the bright bands in the spectrum were not single lines but groups of lines on a faint background. This finding sheds light on the change of a star into a nebula and has implications for understanding the behavior of celestial objects like Nova Aurigae.
