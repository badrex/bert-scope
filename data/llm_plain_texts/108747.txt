tldr: The author investigates the anomalies found in the Indian Arc of Meridian and traces them to their true causes. They discover that the vast ocean to the south of India and the influence of the Himalayas affect the plumb-line, causing discrepancies in the astronomical and geodetic amplitudes. The study helps in understanding the accuracy of relative positions of places in a map and the influence of local attraction on geodetic operations.
