tldr: The article explores the retarded dispersion forces in dielectrics at finite temperatures. The author presents a simplified approach to derive the long-range dispersion forces between atoms in a dielectric medium, using the frequency-dependent susceptibility of the electric field and the dielectric constant at imaginary frequency. This method does not require quantum field theory and allows for the calculation of the dispersion forces at any temperature.
