revised_title: 'Sodium Channel Binding of Tetrodotoxin and Saxitoxin in Excitable Membranes'

tldr: The authors studied the binding of tetrodotoxin and saxitoxin to sodium channels in excitable membranes. They found that these toxins bind to the sodium channels, blocking their function. The study provides evidence that the density of sodium channels in various nerves is relatively low, and the toxins have similar actions despite being different molecules. This research helps to understand the mechanisms of these toxins and their effects on nerve cells.
