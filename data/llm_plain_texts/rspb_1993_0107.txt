revised_title: 'Sulphonylurea Receptor and KATP Channel Dissociation in Rat Insulin-secreting Cell Line'

tldr: 'The study investigates the relationship between the sulphonylurea receptor and KATP channel in rat insulin-secreting cell lines. It concludes that the KATP channel can exist and function independently of the sulphonylurea receptor, suggesting they are not part of a single protein assembly.'
