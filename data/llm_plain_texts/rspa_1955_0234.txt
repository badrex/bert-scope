tldr: The authors present a theoretical study of electrolyte diffusion in cation-exchange resin membranes. They develop a theory based on six assumptions about the nature of the cation-exchange resin membrane and derive a general equation for the cation flux. The study focuses on the diffusion process and its relation to the membrane's properties, providing insights into the behavior of charged membranes in biological systems.
