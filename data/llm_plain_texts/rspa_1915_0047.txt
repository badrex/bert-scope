tldr: The article presents general equations for neutralizing dibasic acids and their use in calculating the acidity of dilute carbonate solutions. The author discusses the equations' applications in understanding the relationship between acid-base chemistry, hydrolysis, and the equilibrium constants of various chemical reactions. These equations help determine the acidity of fluids and the growth of organisms in environments with varying levels of hardness.
