tldr: The authors used ab initio molecular orbital calculations to explore the additivity in the conformational energies of poly-substituted ethanes. They tested a method to obtain the conformational energies of complex molecules from data on smaller parent molecules, such as ethane, its mono-, and 1,2-di-substituted derivatives. The study focused on substituted ethanes with methyl and cyano groups, providing a body of data to test the additivity scheme.
