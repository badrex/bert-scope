tldr: The study investigates the structural changes in the hypothalamus and pars tuberalis of rhesus monkeys in relation to reproduction. It examines the role of specialized ependymal cells, known as tanycytes, which have long processes extending to the primary capillary networks of the pituitary portal vessels. These cells may play a role in regulating pituitary function and form a link between the cerebrospinal fluid and the blood system in the region of the pituitary, contributing to a neuroendocrine control system.
