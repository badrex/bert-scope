tldr: This article investigates the near-tip fields of interface cracks in dissimilar anisotropic media. It identifies the structure of the near-tip field, which consists of a two-dimensional oscillatory singularity and a one-dimensional square root singularity. The author proposes a definition of stress intensity factors for these singularities and finds that the complex stress intensity factor for the oscillatory field does not recover the classical stress intensity factor as the bimaterial degenerates to be non-pathological. The article also provides a formal statement of interfacial fracture mechanics for anisotropic solids.
