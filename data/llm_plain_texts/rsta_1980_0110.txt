tldr: This study investigates the high-temperature mechanical properties of AISI 316 weld metal and how residual elements and additives affect its performance. The research compares weld deposits made from basic and rutile coated electrodes, finding that deposits from rutile coated electrodes exhibit improved tensile strength and slightly reduced ductility. The effects of residual elements like phosphorus and boron on tensile and creep properties are also examined, with boron increasing both tensile and creep strength while leaving ductility largely unaffected.
