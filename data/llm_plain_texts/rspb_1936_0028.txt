tldr: The authors studied color change in various species of Elasmobranch fishes, such as skates and dogfish, and found that their pigmentary effector system is similar to that of Amphibia. They discovered that these fish exhibit a wide range of responses to their surroundings, with some species showing striking color changes and others showing more subtle changes. The authors also found that the progress of color change in Elasmobranch fishes takes longer than in other animals like the minnow or chameleon.
