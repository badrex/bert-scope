tldr: The authors investigated the infra-red spectra of oriented films of sodium deoxyribonucleate under varying degrees of relative humidity. They found that the infra-red dichroism of nearly every band increased with humidity. By analyzing the spectra, they deduced the molecular configuration of the phosphate groups in the DNA, which differed from the Crick-Watson model. This study provided insights into the structure of DNA, a crucial molecule for life.
