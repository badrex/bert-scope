tldr: This study measures the absorption cross-sections of methane in the vacuum ultra-violet range and analyzes the absorption to distinguish between photo-dissociation processes and photo-ionization. The main photo-ionization process is identified, and the photo-ionization cross-section is measured for free electron energies from 20 to about 20. The results are compared with calculations by Dalgarno, and the technique of photographic photometry in the 1100 to 1 region is explained.
