tldr: The article presents a new theoretical method using path integrals to solve the problem of guided wave propagation in stratified dielectric media. This approach avoids the use of modes and provides a compact analytical expression for the field or impulse response. The concept of paths and average path approximation is introduced to approximate the integral, making it a useful method for solving complex propagation problems.
