tldr: This article investigates the electroconvective instability in a fluid layer, focusing on the incipience of steady cellular convection as the electric Hartmann number approaches unity. The authors use a non-uniform electric field to induce an unstable configuration of surface charge and electric field intensity at a planar interface, leading to cellular convection in the plane of the interface. They develop a simple model to predict the flow pattern, voltage required for incipience, and the velocity of the cellular motion, highlighting the competition between viscous and electrical stresses in the fluid layer.
