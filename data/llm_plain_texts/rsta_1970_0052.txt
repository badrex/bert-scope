tldr: This article presents a palaeomagnetic survey of South American rock formations from Northeast Brazil, focusing on Devonian, Carboniferous, and Triassic formations. The study found that the south pole appeared to have moved away from South America in a southeasterly direction during the Devonian and Carboniferous periods, while in the Triassic, it was situated near the present position of the south pole relative to South America. The results are in good agreement with other formations of the same age from other parts of the continent.
