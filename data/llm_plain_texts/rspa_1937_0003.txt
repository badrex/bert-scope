tldr: The author demonstrates the connection between tensor-calculus and spinor-calculus, showing how spinor-calculus can be used to solve complex problems in tensor-calculus. The author applies this connection to Dirac's relativistic equation of the electron, proving that the equation is equivalent to the statement that a specific vector is zero. This work highlights the potential of spinor-calculus in assisting with tensor-based problems, especially in the context of special and general relativity.
