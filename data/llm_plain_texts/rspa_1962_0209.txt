tldr: This article investigates the effect of self-absorption on the rate of collisional-radiative recombination in hydrogen ion plasmas. The authors study three cases: when Lyman radiation is absorbed, when all line radiation is absorbed, and when the plasma is optically thick towards the Lyman continuum. They find that self-absorption can significantly reduce the recombination coefficient, even in low electron density limits. The results provide insights into the behavior of plasmas and help improve understanding of the underlying processes.
