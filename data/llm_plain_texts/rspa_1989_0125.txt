tldr: The authors present a logic specifically designed for analyzing authentication protocols in distributed computing systems. This logic allows for a precise understanding of the differences between various protocols and their required initial assumptions and final beliefs. The authors demonstrate the application of this logic to protocols using shared-key cryptography and public-key cryptography, highlighting its potential for answering questions about the effectiveness and assumptions of authentication protocols.
