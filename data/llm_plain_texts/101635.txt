tldr: 'Monsieur Picart, a French scientist, measured the Earth's circumference by using a method of triangulation. He found that one degree of latitude measures 57060 toises or 281.5 leagues and 60 toises. This method involved measuring a base of 5663 toises and using accurate instruments and telescopic sights. His findings were significant because they provided a more accurate measurement than previous attempts and could potentially be applied to other countries.'
