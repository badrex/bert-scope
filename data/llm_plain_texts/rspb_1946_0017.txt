tldr: The author studied the larval cuticle of Sarcophaga falculata, focusing on its structure and composition. The cuticle consists of two main layers: the outer epicuticle and the inner endocuticle. The epicuticle is a double structure with no chitin, while the endocuticle is a laminated chitin-protein complex. The study also examines the role of pore canals in the cuticle and the changes that occur during the formation of the puparium.
