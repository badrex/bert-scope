tldr: The authors conducted experiments with chloroform and other anesthetics to study their properties in solutions. They found that chloroform forms unstable compounds with proteins, which limit the chemical activities of cells and cause anesthesia. The authors also discovered that other anesthetics have higher solubilities in serum than in water, and that their effects on proteins are similar to those of chloroform. This research contributes to the understanding of how anesthetics work at a chemical level.
