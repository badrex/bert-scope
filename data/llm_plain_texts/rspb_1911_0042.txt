tldr: The authors investigated the effects of various animal extracts on milk secretion in lactating animals, focusing on the role of hormones from the pituitary gland and corpus luteum. They found that extracts from the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland and corpus luteum significantly increased milk secretion, while other extracts had no effect or only minor impacts. This research provided insights into the hormonal regulation of milk production and the potential for using hormones to stimulate lactation.
