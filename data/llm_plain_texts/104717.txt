tldr: The author, Tho. Birch, describes a powerful earthquake that shook London and its surroundings. The event was followed by a period of calm air and westerly winds. The author compares the sensation of being awakened by the motion to falling into a fit. This account was written before he had spoken to anyone else about the event.
