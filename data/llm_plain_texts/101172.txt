tldr: This article narrates a strange case of unusual bleeding in a young child. The child, aged a quarter of a year, experienced bleeding from the nose, ears, head, shoulders, waist, toes, arms, and fingers. The bleeding was so profuse that it soaked through the child's clothes and required frequent changes of linen. The child never cried violently during the bleeding episodes but only groaned. After the child's death, small needle-like holes were observed at the bleeding sites. The mother and other women who attended the child testified to the events, and the blood was described as having normal thickness. The child's death occurred around Candlemas.
