tldr: The article investigates the structure of the stagnation-point flow in the presence of weak steady cross-stream vorticity in the external flow. It examines a specific case of the two-dimensional basic forward stagnation-point flow past a circular cylinder with external three-dimensional vortical disturbance. The presence of weak but finite streamwise vorticity in the external flow can be supported by the flow in the stagnation zone, leading to a substructure of counter-rotating streamwise eddies in the boundary layer.
