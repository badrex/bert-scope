tldr: The authors analyze Mayer's theory of condensation and the partition function, providing a rigorous and simplified explanation of the method. They demonstrate how Mayer's approach can be used to derive the conditions for co-existence of multiple phases, such as the triple point. The study focuses on the statistical mechanics of condensing systems and the application of complex integration techniques.
