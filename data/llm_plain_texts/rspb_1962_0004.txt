tldr: The authors studied the absorption spectra of haem a compounds with detergents, specifically focusing on the effects of non-ionic detergents like Emasol 4130. They found that these detergents cause a CO-shift towards shorter wavelengths and that haem a combines more strongly with Emasol than with other compounds. This research helps to understand the relationship between haem a compounds and cytochromes of group a.
