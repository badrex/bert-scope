tldr: 'The article is a biography of Irving Langmuir, a renowned scientist who made significant contributions to the fields of physical and surface chemistry. Langmuir is known for his divergent phenomena theory, which explains the occurrence of increasingly large effects from a small beginning. His work in the General Electric Research Laboratory led to advancements in thermal conduction, hydrogen dissociation, and the development of gas-filled lamps. Langmuir's research on the properties of solids and liquids, particularly the behavior of molecules on liquid surfaces, revolutionized the understanding of surface chemistry.'
