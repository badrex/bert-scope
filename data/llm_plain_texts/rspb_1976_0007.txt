tldr: The article discusses the challenges and solutions in joint replacement, particularly focusing on the knee joint. It highlights the need for permanent secure fixation of the prosthesis to the skeleton and the difficulties encountered in stabilizing hinge-type prostheses at the knee. The author suggests that the incidence of loosening of hinge prostheses at the knee may be higher than that for ball-and-socket prostheses at the hip.
