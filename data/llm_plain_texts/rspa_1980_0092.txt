tldr: The author investigates the formation of sharp corners at a free surface in fluid dynamics, focusing on the local form of the sharp-pointed crests observed in breaking water waves. They derive a new class of exact free-surface flows, where the free surface takes the form of a variable hyperbola with rotating principal axes. This research is relevant to understanding the flow near the tip of a breaking gravity wave and the formation of sharp crests and cusps in water waves.
