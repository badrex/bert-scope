tldr: This study examines the effects of self-fertilization and outcrossing on progeny characteristics in two highly inbreeding populations of the plant species Leavenworthia. The results show that progeny from selfing have lower survival and fertility than outcrossed progeny, indicating significant inbreeding depression in these populations. The high mutation rate in these populations is consistent with other studies and has implications for the evolution of breeding systems in plants.
