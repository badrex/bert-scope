tldr: This article discusses the pendulum observations conducted at Kew and Greenwich observatories to determine the relative force of gravity. The observations aimed to improve the connection between the two observatories and the Indian series of pendulum operations. The results showed variations in the vibration numbers, indicating possible changes in latitude and providing insights into the relationship between the two observatories.
