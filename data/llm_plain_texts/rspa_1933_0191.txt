tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the transmission of infra-red radiation through a thin layer of horn. They found that the horn layer absorbed radiation in the range of 2.75-3.75 (x) and beyond 6 (x). The study is of interest in understanding the penetration of heat rays through the outer layer of the skin.
