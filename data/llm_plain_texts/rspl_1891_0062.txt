semantic_tags:

tldr: The author argues for the separation of biologic regions and tabulation areas, proposing a new map system for more efficient and accurate distribution mapping of plants and animals. He suggests using a modified version of Wallace's zoologic regions map as a geographic framework for reference and tabulation, with easily remembered and accurately defined boundaries.
