tldr: This article discusses the process of anaerobic fermentation in producing alcohols, such as ethanol, isopropanol, and butanol, from carbohydrates using yeasts and bacteria. The author highlights the potential for bioconversion of carbohydrates to alcohols and other products, given the right technical progress and cost of carbohydrate compared to fossil hydrocarbons. The article also examines the supply of carbohydrate raw materials, fermentation technology, and likely developments in the field.
