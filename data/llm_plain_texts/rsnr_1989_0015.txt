tldr: This article discusses Christiaan Huygens' response to Newton's theory of gravity presented in the Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica. Huygens, a Dutch scientist, had a different explanation for gravity based on Cartesian vortices and the mechanical philosophy. He believed that gravity was caused by the motion of a whirlwind of subtle matter around celestial bodies, pushing coarser particles towards the center. Huygens' theory was a variation of Descartes' vortex theory, and he performed experiments to support his ideas.
