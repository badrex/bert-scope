tldr: The author conducted a detailed chemical analysis of various resins, including gamboge, guaiacum, and acaroid resin. They found that these resins have different chemical compositions and properties, with acaroid resin containing the most oxygen. The author also proposed that resins can be represented by formulae exhibiting their elementary constitution, with some elements being constant while others vary.
