tldr: This article presents an experimental investigation of the ternary system carbon monoxide, nitrogen, and hydrogen, as well as the binary systems carbon monoxide-hydrogen and nitrogen-hydrogen. The research focuses on understanding the behavior of these gas mixtures at low temperatures and high pressures, which is important for the technical production of hydrogen. The authors describe the experimental apparatus, methods, and results, providing valuable insights into the phase equilibria and thermodynamics of these systems.
