tldr: This article presents experiments conducted by William Marcet on the effects of altitude on human respiration. The experiments took place at Yvoire, Courmayeur, and the Col de Géant, with participants breathing through a face-piece connected to a rubber bag. The results showed that as altitude increased, the amount of carbon dioxide in the exhaled air also increased, while the amount of oxygen decreased. This indicates that the human body adjusts its respiration rate and efficiency in response to changes in altitude.
