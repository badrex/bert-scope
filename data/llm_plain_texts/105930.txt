tldr: Edward King proposed a theory on how spars, crystals, and possibly jewels are formed through the accumulation of crystalline (possibly saline) particles in cavities within porous stones. He observed that the size and transparency of these formations depend on the amount and type of particles present, as well as the rate of moisture and vapor flow. This theory is consistent with the presence of similar formations in both large caverns and small cavities.
