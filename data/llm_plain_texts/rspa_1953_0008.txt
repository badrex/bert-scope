tldr: This study investigates the hydraulic permeability of saturated soil in situ using a sand-tank laboratory and equipment. The authors apply a part of this equipment to a study of the flow of water between two wells, providing a measure of horizontal permeability of the bed. They discuss the assessment of the capillary fringe's contribution to the flow and the end correction for non-penetrating wells. The findings contribute to understanding soil properties and groundwater flow in porous materials.
