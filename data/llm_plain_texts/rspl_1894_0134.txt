revised_title: "An Investigation of the Four Forms of Breathing and Their Effects on Carbon Dioxide Expired and Oxygen Absorbed"
semantic_tags:
  - Respiration
  - Carbon Dioxide
  - Oxygen Absorption
  - Breathing Patterns
  - Respiratory Ratio
tldr: The author investigates four forms of breathing: normal, forced, exercise, and voluntary. They analyze the carbon dioxide expired and oxygen absorbed in each form using experiments and bell-jars. The results show that each form of breathing has a different impact on the respiratory ratio and the body's carbon dioxide and oxygen levels.
