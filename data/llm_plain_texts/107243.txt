tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the quantity of carbon in carbonic acid and the nature of the diamond. They found that charcoal absorbs water from the air, which affects the accuracy of experiments involving carbon and oxygen gas. The authors also determined the weight of carbonic acid gas at mean temperature and pressure, contributing to a better understanding of the chemical composition of carbonic acid.
