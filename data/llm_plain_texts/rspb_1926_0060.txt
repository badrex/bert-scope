tldr: 'The author conducted experiments using X-rays on the protozoan organism Colpidium Colpoda. They observed that a certain dose of radiation accelerated the motion of the organisms, causing them to move rapidly around the edge of the drop. As the dose increased, the organisms' motion slowed down, eventually ceasing, and the cells experienced structural changes, ultimately leading to death. This study demonstrates the lethal effects of X-rays on protozoa for the first time.'
