tldr: The authors successfully detected the Fresnel drag effect in a semiconductor (InAs) by placing it inside a He-Ne ring laser. This effect, caused by free carriers moving in a solid, is a relativistic phenomenon. The results show a small change in the refractive index due to the electron motion, which is of interest for understanding the interaction between light and matter in semiconductors.
