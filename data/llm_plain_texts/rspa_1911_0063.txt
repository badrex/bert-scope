tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the boiling points of various saturated aqueous solutions. They found that the boiling point of a solution is the temperature at which the vapor above the solution is in equilibrium with the free vapor. The authors also discovered that the rate of increase in depth of the solution varies with solubility and developed a method to extrapolate the equilibrium temperature at zero height of liquid, which they called the "hypsometer point." This study provides a foundation for understanding osmotic pressures in solutions.
