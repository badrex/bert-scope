tldr: The authors discuss the spin-orbit interaction in complexes using tensor operator methods. They extend the tables of transformation coefficients to calculate the coupling of orbital to spin space for odd-electron configurations. The complete spin-orbit matrices for the configurations are determined and used to calculate energy levels for trivalent chromium in magnesium oxide and potassium hexachloromolybdate, and iridium hexafluoride.
