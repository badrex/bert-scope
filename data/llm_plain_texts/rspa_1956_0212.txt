tldr: The authors studied the magnetic properties of superconducting mercury colloids with varying particle sizes. They found that the initial slopes of the magnetization curves were proportional to the applied magnetic field, and the penetration depth was affected by the particle size and temperature. The results were compared with the predictions of the London theory and Pippard's modification, with the latter showing better agreement. The study also provided insights into the surface energy and the two-fluid model of the superconducting state.
