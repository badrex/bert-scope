tldr: This study investigates the effects of various substances and hormones on oxidation-reduction potentials, pH, and oxygen tension in lactating mammary glands of rats and rabbits. The research found that breathing oxygen, nitrogen, and other gases, as well as hormone injections, caused significant changes in the oxidation-reduction potentials, oxygen tension, and pH levels in the mammary glands. These findings provide insights into the physiological changes induced in lactating mammary glands by hormones and other substances.
