tldr: This study examines the igneous history of the Andean Cordillera and Patagonian Plateau around latitude 46°S, focusing on the persistent igneous activity in the region since the Middle Jurassic. The research highlights the role of easterly dipping subduction along the Pacific margin and the formation of the Patagonian batholith and calc-alkaline volcanics. The findings also discuss the development of volcaniclastic sequences and the tectonic environment associated with the basalt-rhyolite volcanism on the eastern side of the cordillera.
