tldr: This article examines the anatomy and twisting of the umbilical cord, discussing various theories and observations about the cause of the spiral shape. The author concludes that the main factor in the twist is the umbilical vein, and that the spiral growth of the cord is directed by a mechanism at the foetal end, rather than by revolutions of the foetus.
