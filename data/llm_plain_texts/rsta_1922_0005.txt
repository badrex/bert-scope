tldr: The authors developed a method called "analysis by periodic interruption" to study sound vibrations in air and water, aiming to obtain sound spectra. They used an interrupter to measure the amplitude and frequency of each component of the sound, and their method has implications for understanding wave-form and phase relations in sound.
