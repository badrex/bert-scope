tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the decomposition of corrosive sublimate and its reactions with various substances, such as water, alcohol, ether, and oils. The experiments showed that light alone does not decompose corrosive sublimate, and the solubility of the substance varies with different solvents. The author also discovered that when heated with certain oils, corrosive sublimate undergoes chemical reactions and forms new compounds.
