tldr: This study investigates the chromatic behavior and hormonal control in elasmobranchs, specifically focusing on the role of the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland in color changes. The research finds that the slow color change in elasmobranchs is due to a humoral basis, with the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland playing a significant role in controlling the color changes. The study also discusses the different types of melanophores found in elasmobranchs and their behavior.
