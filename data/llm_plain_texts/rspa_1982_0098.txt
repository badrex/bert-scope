tldr: The authors present a new class of bipolar vacuum gravitational fields by applying two rank-zero H.K.X. transformations to an arbitrary static axisymmetric solution (Weyl solution) as a seed metric. They derive the full four-dimensional metric for this new solution, which can be used to study the properties and behavior of these gravitational fields in space-time.
