tldr: 'William Crookes conducted experiments with a radiometer, a device that demonstrates the pressure of light. He discovered that when a magnet was brought near the moving arms of the radiometer, the arms stopped, and the glass envelope started rotating in the opposite direction. This showed that the internal friction of the steel point on the glass socket and the vanes against the residual air was significant. Crookes emphasized the importance of experimental observations and keeping an open mind about the underlying theories.'
