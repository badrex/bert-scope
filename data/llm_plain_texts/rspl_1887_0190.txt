tldr: The author discusses the discovery of fossil Carboniferous plants, specifically Heterangium stems, and suggests that they may have been ancestral forms with exogenous stems and fern-like foliage. These features may have been passed on to modern Cycads and Ferns, with Stangeria retaining some of both.
