  - Magneto-Ionic Theory
tldr: The authors present a general method for analyzing the propagation of electromagnetic waves through the ionosphere, building upon previous work by Appleton, Hartree, Saha, Rai, and Mathur. They discuss various experimental methods for studying the ionosphere, such as the angle of incidence, wavelength change, and group retardation methods. The authors also review the magneto-ionic theory, which is the most widely used theoretical method for understanding the propagation of electromagnetic waves through the ionosphere.
