tldr: The author proposes a new term, 'efficiency,' to measure the work performed by machines, such as steam engines. He compares efficiency and duty, concluding that the steam engine's efficiency should be maximized to improve its performance. The author also discusses the potential benefits of using more elastic fluids in mechanical applications and examines the differences in performance between engines in Cornwall.
