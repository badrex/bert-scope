revised_title: 'Rearrangement of nif Genes during Cyanobacterial Heterocyst Differentiation'
semantic_tags:
  - Nitrogen fixation
  - Cyanobacteria
  - Heterocyst differentiation
  - Gene rearrangement
  - Site-specific recombination
tldr: The article discusses the process of heterocyst differentiation in cyanobacteria, specifically Anabaena, and how DNA rearrangements occur during this process. The nifD gene, which encodes the a subunit of nitrogenase, undergoes rearrangement through site-specific recombination, resulting in the formation of a nifHDK operon. This discovery helps in understanding the molecular mechanisms controlling gene expression during heterocyst development.
