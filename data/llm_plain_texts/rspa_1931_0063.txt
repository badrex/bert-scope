tldr: The authors present a wave treatment of optical and equivalent paths in stratified media, discussing the limitations of geometrical optics and the importance of considering wave properties. They explore the concepts of optical and equivalent paths, and demonstrate their application in various scenarios, including a finite slab of refracting medium backed by a total reflector.
