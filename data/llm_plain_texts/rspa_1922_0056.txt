tldr: The author investigates the effects of compressive stress on the susceptibility of various magnetite rocks. They found that the susceptibility of some magnetite varieties can decrease by up to 50% under compressive stress, while others show little to no change. This study helps to understand how the Earth's crust responds to geological forces.
