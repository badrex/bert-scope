tldr: Researchers recorded visual evoked potentials (VEPs) from healthy subjects to study the timing of activity in human area V4, a region of the brain responsible for color processing. Using dipole source analysis, they identified three active brain regions corresponding to areas VI, V2, and V4, which showed sequential but overlapping activity. Activity in area V4 started at 100 ms and peaked at 135 ms after the onset of the visual stimulus. This study provides valuable information about the time course of activity in specialized areas of the human occipital lobe.
