tldr: This article explores the frequency dependence of the Kerr constant, which is related to the difference in refractive indices of a material under a uniform static electric field. The authors develop a semi-classical and quantum theory to study the effect of dispersion near absorption bands, providing insights into molecular polarizability and the orientation of transition dipole moments.
