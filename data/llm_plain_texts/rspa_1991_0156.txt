tldr: This article reviews various mechanisms of deflagration to detonation transition, focusing on the initiation of planar detonations through thermally induced processes. The authors discuss different experimental setups and numerical models used to study the transition, highlighting the role of shock waves, chemical heat release, and reaction zones in the process. The article provides a comprehensive overview of the literature on this topic, emphasizing the complexity and variety of ways in which deflagration to detonation transitions can occur.
