tldr: This article investigates the role of antelopes as reservoirs for Trypanosoma gambiense, the parasite responsible for African sleeping sickness. The study examines the infectivity and immunity of antelopes to the disease and its impact on Glossina palpalis, the tsetse fly that transmits the parasite. The findings show that antelopes can remain infective to the tsetse fly for a significant period, maintaining the reservoir of the disease.
