tldr: Dr. William Musgrave conducted experiments to study the transmission of blue-colored liquor into the lacteals, which are part of the lymphatic system. He found that the lacteals could be colored blue by injecting a solution of indigo or stone blue, suggesting that the lymphatic vessels could admit large particles and even eggs or animalcula. This discovery has implications for understanding the digestive system, animal reproduction, and the reception of other substances in the body.
