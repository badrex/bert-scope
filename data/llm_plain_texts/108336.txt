tldr: The author, W.R. Grove, describes his experiments using voltaic ignition and eudiometry to analyze various gases, including the decomposition of water into its constituent gases. He also discusses the effects of different gases on the ignition of a platinum wire and the intensity of heat produced. Grove's experiments led to the discovery of a small amount of oxygen in hydrogen, which caused unexpected contractions in the gas's volume.
