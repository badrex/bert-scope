tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the differences in the suprarenal capsules of various fish species. They found that the paired suprarenal bodies in Elasmobranch fishes correspond to the medulla and cortex of the suprarenal capsules in higher vertebrates. The study provides evidence of the homology between the paired bodies of Elasmobranchs and the medulla of the mammalian suprarenal.
