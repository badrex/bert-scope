tldr: This study investigates the phase equilibria of coal gas at low temperatures and high pressures to provide fundamental data necessary for the design of liquefaction and separation plant. The authors developed a modified experimental apparatus to study the behavior of complex mixtures and analyzed the samples using a Bone-Newitt analysis apparatus. The results can be applied to improve the separation and utilization of coal gas constituents for various industrial processes.
