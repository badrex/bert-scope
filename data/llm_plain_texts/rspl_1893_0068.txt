tldr: The authors conducted experiments injecting sugar into a dog's vein to study the chemical changes it undergoes in the body. They discovered that large amounts of sugar can cause nerve symptoms, including convulsions and coma, and that sugar is not eliminated through the kidneys in the form of sugar. The study also found that small amounts of sugar were present in the vomit and saliva, and that sugar metabolism does not involve significant glycogen formation.
