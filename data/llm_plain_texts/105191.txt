tldr: This article describes a rare skin disease that made a young woman's skin hard and impervious to sweat. The patient was treated with a warm milk bath and a vapor bath, which eventually helped her skin soften and perspire again. The treatment also included a soft and relaxing diet and bloodletting to promote general relaxation and improve circulation.
