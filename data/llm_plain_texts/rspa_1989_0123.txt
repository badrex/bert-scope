tldr: This article discusses the behavior of high-activation-energy reactions in gas mixtures when exposed to shock waves. The authors analyze the small disturbance equations and the onset of thermal explosions, focusing on the ignition process and the role of high activation energies. They find that temperature and pressure perturbations have logarithmic singularities at ignition, while density perturbations have a local adjustment near the ignition point. The results show excellent agreement with numerical calculations.
