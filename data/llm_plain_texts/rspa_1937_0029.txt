tldr: The authors investigated the dielectric polarization of long-chain ketones near their melting points. They found that the polarization of these substances increases as the temperature rises, indicating that the chain molecules become more mobile and can orient themselves in the electric field. This study provides insights into the behavior of long-chain ketones and their potential applications in various fields.
