tldr: The author, John Smeaton, describes an improvement in the application of the quadrant of altitude to a celestial globe for resolving problems related to azimuth and altitude. The improvement involves a more solid construction of the quadrant, allowing for more accurate measurements and better performance. This innovation enables the use of the celestial globe as a valuable tool for solving problems in astronomy and understanding the movements of celestial bodies.
