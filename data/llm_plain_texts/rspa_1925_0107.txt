tldr: This article explores the kinetic theory of surface films and the behavior of solutions at phase boundaries. The authors discuss the role of soluble substances in reducing surface tension and the differences between soluble and insoluble films. They also examine the Traube-Langmuir theory and its limitations, suggesting alternative explanations for the behavior of surface films.
