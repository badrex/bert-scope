tldr: This article discusses the development of improved deep-sea thermometers to accurately measure ocean temperatures at great depths. The author, John E. Davis, explains the defects in previous thermometer designs and describes the experiments conducted to test new, stronger thermometers. The results showed that these new thermometers were more reliable and allowed for the correction of previous temperature observations. The author also suggests using multiple instruments for each observation to ensure accuracy.
