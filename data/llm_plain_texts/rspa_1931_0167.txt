tldr: The author conducted interferometric measurements in the spectrum of the iron arc in the region λ 3100 – λ 3500. The results confirm the values calculated from the International Astronomical Union (I.A.U.) Standards and agree well with recent measurements of the vacuum arc by Burns and Walters. The apparatus used in the study provided accurate results, with a mean systematic difference of only 0.0001 A. and a mean accidental difference of 0.0006 A.
