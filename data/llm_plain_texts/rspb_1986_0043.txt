tldr: This study investigates the relationship between transmembrane calcium transport and membrane potential in retinal rod discs. The researchers found that the disc membrane is impermeable to potassium ions and that the accumulation and release of calcium ions are accompanied by the generation of inside positive and inside negative transmembrane potentials, respectively. The results suggest that a Na-Ca exchange process participates in the uptake of calcium ions in photoreceptor discs.
