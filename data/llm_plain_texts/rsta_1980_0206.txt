tldr: This article discusses the evidence for chemical heterogeneity in the Earth's mantle, examining the properties of ocean and continental crusts, as well as the evidence from kimberlite pipes. The authors present data on trace elements and isotopic ratios, arguing that the assumption of a uniform composition in the mantle is likely not justified.
