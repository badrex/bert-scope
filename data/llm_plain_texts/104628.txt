tldr: In this letter, Leonard Euler discusses the gradual approach of the Earth to the Sun, which he believes is caused by the resistance the Earth experiences in its motion. He also explains that this phenomenon implies that the Solar System cannot last forever and must have had a beginning and an end. Euler hopes to find more older observations to determine how much the years become shorter in each century.
