tldr: This study investigates the intensity variations of the night sky's light when analyzed by color filters. The author, Lord Rayleigh, uses a photoelectric cell to measure the opacity of neutral glasses and compares the light of the night sky to a self-luminous standard source. The results show that the night sky's light is subject to variations in both quantity and quality, which cannot be explained by varying atmospheric transparency.
