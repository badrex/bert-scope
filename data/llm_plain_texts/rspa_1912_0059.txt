tldr: The author presents a new modification of the chamber crank chain mechanism that allows for continuous variation of the fluid volume in each cycle. This mechanism overcomes the limitations of previous designs by reducing friction and improving efficiency, making it suitable for high-pressure and high-speed applications.
