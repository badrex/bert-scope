tldr: The authors studied the dispersion of a gaseous tracer in a flowing stream of another gas, with mass transfer to a retentive layer in a circular tube. They verified Aris's analysis by experimenting with a system that used a retentive layer of stagnant gas held within a porous solid structure. This research can be applied to gas chromatography and the study of gaseous diffusion in catalysts and other porous materials.
