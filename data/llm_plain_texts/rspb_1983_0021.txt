tldr: The authors determined the structure of the physiological-temperature form of hen egg-white lysozyme at a resolution of 2.0 Å using X-ray crystallography. The structure is very similar to the room-temperature tetragonal form, with differences in the upper part of the active site due to crystal contact. These differences may explain the difficulty of inhibitor-binding in high-temperature orthorhombic crystals but do not reflect the behavior of lysozyme in solution at high temperatures.
