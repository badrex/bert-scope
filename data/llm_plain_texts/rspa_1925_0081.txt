tldr: The authors study the catalytic decomposition of alcohols on copper surfaces, focusing on the role of the hydroxyl group in orientating the adsorbed alcohol molecules. They propose a model of reaction centers on the catalyst surface and discuss the energy changes involved in the process. The findings provide insights into the non-uniform activity of catalyst surfaces and the role of adsorption films in chemical reactions.
