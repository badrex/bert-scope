tldr: The authors conducted comparative studies on indigogenic reactions for esterase localization using indoxyl acetates. They found correlations between staining patterns, molecular structures of dyes and intermediates, and dye solubilities. This led to the development of an improved indigogenic staining process for esterases, using 5-bromo-4-chloroindoxyl acetate, with a precision of about 0.5 Âµ. The study also demonstrated the potential for quantitative cytochemical studies in the future.
