tldr: The author studied the crystal structure of anthrone and compared it with anthraquinone, finding that both possess long-range disorder with a statistical distribution of molecules among two centrosymmetrically-related orientations. The anisotropic thermal-vibration parameters were analyzed, revealing a large independent out-of-plane vibration of the oxygen atom and affecting the thermal expansion coefficients. This research contributes to understanding the properties of pseudosymmetric and mixed crystals of small organic molecules.
