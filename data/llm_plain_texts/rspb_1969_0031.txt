tldr: This article provides a general introduction to the cytoplasm and its organelles, discussing their structure, function, and interactions within the cell. It highlights the importance of analytical methods, such as cytochemistry, electron microscopy, and biochemistry, in understanding the various cell constituents, including the cell membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, chloroplasts, lysosomes, peroxisomes, Golgi bodies, and microtubules. The article also emphasizes the need to study the living cell and its organelles in their entirety, rather than isolating them for analysis.
