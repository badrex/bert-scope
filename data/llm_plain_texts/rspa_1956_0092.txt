tldr: The authors used molecular orbital theory and self-consistent field calculations to study the electronic structure of diborane, a four-centre, four-electron problem. They found that the molecular orbitals of lowest energy are the completely symmetric orbital and the π* orbital with a nodal plane normal to the line between the protons. The bridge hydrogens have a hybridic character, and the bond in diborane can be described as a resonance hybrid between single-bond and no-bond structures.
