tldr: The author conducted spectroscopic observations of sunspots to test two rival theories about their physical nature. The observations showed that the phenomena presented by sunspots are not due to radiation from a source like the one indicated by M. Faye's theory. The absorption hypothesis offers a partial solution to the problem of sunspots, and further detailed spectroscopic examination of the sun's surface may bring more knowledge about its physical constitution.
