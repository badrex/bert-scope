tldr: This article explores the properties of Killing-Yano tensors, which are mathematical objects related to symmetries in space-time. The authors classify these tensors, derive line elements that admit them, and discuss their physical interpretations. They also highlight the connection between Killing-Yano tensors and angular momentum in certain situations. The article provides insights into the understanding of space-time geometry and its relation to physical phenomena.
