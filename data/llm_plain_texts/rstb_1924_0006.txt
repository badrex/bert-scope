tldr: The authors studied the development of the hepatic venous system and postcaval vein in various marsupial species. They found that the development of these veins varies among different genera, but the origin of the postcaval vein is consistent throughout the group. The researchers also discovered that the hepatic veins form two complete venous rings around the gut, which play a crucial role in the liver's development.
