tldr: This article examines the effect of inserting different lengths of parallel middle bodies on a ship's wave resistance. The author applies the principle of wave interference to understand how the wave-making length of a ship changes with varying middle body lengths and speeds. The study provides valuable insights into ship design and resistance, contributing to the understanding of wave resistance and ship performance.
