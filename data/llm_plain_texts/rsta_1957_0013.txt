tldr: This study investigates the permanent magnetization of the Torridonian sandstone series in north-west Scotland, focusing on the Diabaig, Applecross, and Aultbea groups. The research finds that the majority of these rocks were magnetized soon after deposition and have retained their magnetization substantially unaltered. The findings contribute to the understanding of the Earth's magnetic field and the geological history of the region.
