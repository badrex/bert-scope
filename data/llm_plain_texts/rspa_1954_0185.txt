tldr: This article studies the etching of different diamond faces, cleavage, dodecahedron, and cube, using high-resolution microscopy, multiple-beam interferometry, and the light-profile microscope. The authors discover a laminated internal fine structure within the diamond, revealing that the diamond has grown by laying down a large number of thin lamellae, sheets parallel to the crystallographic planes. The etching process provides a sectional history of the diamond's growth, showing increased resistance to etching at the onset or end of each layer.
