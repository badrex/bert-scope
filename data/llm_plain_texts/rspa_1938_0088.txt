tldr: The authors present a rigorous calculation of the cascade theory of electronic showers, explaining how the number of particles and photons change due to pair production and collision radiation. They introduce a new variable to simplify the fundamental equations and provide a parametric representation of the distribution function. The study helps to understand the behavior of high-energy particles and photons in matter.
