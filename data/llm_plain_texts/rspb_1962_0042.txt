tldr: 'This study uses radar technology to observe and analyze the roosting and dispersal behavior of starlings. Radar ring angels, or patterns of echoes on radar screens, are caused by starlings leaving their roosts at sunrise. The research shows that starlings tend to fly out earlier and return later in relation to sunlight intensity in winter compared to summer. The study also provides insights into the flocking behavior and population density of starlings.'
