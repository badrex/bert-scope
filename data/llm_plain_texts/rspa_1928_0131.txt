revised_title: 'Energy of a Body in Motion in an Infinite Fluid and its Application to Airships'

tldr: The author calculates the energy of a body moving in an infinite fluid, with a focus on airships. They derive an equation for the energy of the flow and use it to determine the "virtual mass" of an airship in accelerated motion. The author also applies this concept to airship shapes and compares their virtual mass to that of a spheroid with the same fineness ratio.
