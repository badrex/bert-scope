tldr: The authors study the geochemical processes in anoxic marine muds and mudstones, focusing on the reactions involving carbon, sulfur, and iron during early and deep burial diagenesis. They explore the influence of early diagenetic reactions on deeper processes and discuss the factors affecting pyritization and the incorporation of sulfur into organic matter in these sediments.
