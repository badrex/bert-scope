tldr: The author, Bernard E. Brodhurst, examines the unique structure and physiology of the human iris. He explains that the iris is an active fibrocellular tissue, different from other tissues in the body, and is primarily controlled by the sympathetic nervous system. The iris's contractility is the motor power of the sympathetic system, making it irritable and capable of involuntary motion and tension. Brodhurst also discusses the role of the ciliary body in producing a current that affects the iris's shape.
