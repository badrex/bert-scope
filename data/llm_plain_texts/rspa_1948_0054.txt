tldr: The authors propose the use of interlacing nets for relaxation methods in problems involving two dependent variables, such as two-dimensional elastic problems. They explain how to apply these nets to calculate displacements and stresses in a solid, and demonstrate their method through various examples. This technique improves the accuracy and efficiency of relaxation methods in solving complex problems.
