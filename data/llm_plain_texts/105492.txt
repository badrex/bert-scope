tldr: Dr. Wolfe shares his continued research on the Polish Cochineal insect, including the discovery of the male fly and the plant it is primarily found on, Scleranthus perennis. He also provides a detailed description of the insect's appearance and the plant's characteristics. Henry Baker presents this information to the Royal Society, hoping that other researchers will find and study these insects in England during the summer months.
