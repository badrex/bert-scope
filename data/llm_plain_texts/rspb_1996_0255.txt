tldr: This study used positron emission tomography (PET) to investigate the formation of topographical memory in humans. The results showed that topographical learning, which involves creating a mental map of a large-scale environment, activated the right parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus, as well as the precuneus. This suggests that the human hippocampal formation plays a crucial role in learning to navigate and find one's way in complex environments.
