tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the form of the wave surface of quartz by measuring the distance between the two sheets of light waves in the crystal. They extended their observations over the entire wave surface, providing a more accurate measure of the distance between the sheets and the form of the wave surface. This research helped improve the understanding of the properties of quartz and its applications in optics.
