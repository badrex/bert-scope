tldr: This article discusses the principles and applications of dipolar oscillations and phase interferometry in solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments. The authors present a general theory of double-resonance interactions based on the heteronuclear dipolar Hamiltonian and describe various experiments using dipolar modulation and selective dipolar difference spectra to study hydrogen-bonded systems and catalytic systems. They also explore phase interferometric techniques to examine the motion and structure of sodium ions in alumina.
