tldr: The authors investigate the instability of a three-dimensional boundary layer on an infinite swept attachment line, focusing on the effect of suction on the instability. They found that the attachment line boundary layer on a swept wing can be significantly stabilized by extremely small amounts of suction, which is essential for maintaining laminar flow in wings.
