tldr: The authors conducted experiments on cats to study the projection of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) onto the cortex. They used the method of retrograde cell degeneration to investigate the organization of the afferent fibers from the LGN to the visual cortex. The results showed a well-defined topical organization in the geniculo-cortical projection, with anterior parts of the nucleus projecting anteriorly and posterior parts projecting posteriorly. The study also found that the three cyto-architectonic subdivisions of the cat's visual cortex (areas 17, 18, and 19) receive differential afferent connections from the LGN.
