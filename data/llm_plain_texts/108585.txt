tldr: "The author, William B. Carpenter, conducted extensive research on the Foraminifera, a group of animals with spiral, multilocular shells. He examined their internal structure, external forms, and physiological history, using specimens collected from various geographical areas and geological strata. Carpenter's research aimed to provide a solid foundation for understanding the classification, range, and variation of Foraminifera species."
