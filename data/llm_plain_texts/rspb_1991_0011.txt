tldr: This study investigates the countershading reflex in cephalopods, which involves the expansion of chromatophores on the ventral surface and retraction on the dorsal surface when the animal is rotated. The reflex is mediated by the statocysts and helps maintain countershading during moments of disorientation. The research includes experiments on Sepia, Loligo, and Octopus species.
