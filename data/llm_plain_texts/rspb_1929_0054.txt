tldr: The study investigates the effects of X-radiation on the spermatogenesis of Lepisma domestica, a type of silverfish. The research shows that X-radiation causes changes in the cytoplasm and its elements, while the nucleus appears to remain unaltered. The study also reveals differences in the changes observed in Lepisma domestica compared to Cavia, another organism studied for similar effects. The findings contribute to the understanding of the genetic and cytological effects of X-radiation on insects.
