tldr: This article discusses the anomalous dispersion and absorption of X-rays, focusing on the theoretical reasons for the observed value of oscillator strength and the equivalence of electrons to classical electrons. The authors make detailed calculations of the dispersion for specific cases and consider the relation between oscillator strength and the intensity of absorption of radiation. They also analyze experimental data and discuss the dependence of dispersion on various factors.
