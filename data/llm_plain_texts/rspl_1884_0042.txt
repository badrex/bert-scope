tldr: The authors studied the effects of stress and strain on the electrical conductivity of cobalt, magnesium, steel, and platinum-iridium. They discovered that metals have critical points where there is a sudden increase in the ratio of permanent extension or resistance to the applied load. The authors also found that the critical points for these metals are in simple ratios, and the value of Young's modulus is related to the loads at each critical point.
