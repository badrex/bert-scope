tldr: This article presents a study of four new types of pleochroic haloes (A, B, C, and D) found in biotite minerals. The researchers classify these haloes based on their structure and ring radii, and discuss their possible origins related to radioactive elements. The findings contribute to the understanding of the geological and mineralogical processes involving these haloes.
