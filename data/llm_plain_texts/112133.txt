tldr: The authors, Edward Frankland and B. F. Duppa, describe their research on synthesizing butyric and caproic ethers from acetic ether. They explain the process of replacing hydrogen atoms in the methyl group of acetic ether with other radicals to create different ethers. The authors also discuss the properties and reactions of the synthesized butyric and caproic ethers, including their decomposition and the production of butyric and caproic acids. This research demonstrates the potential for further extension of this reaction to other homologous series.
