tldr: The authors discovered that the gastrovascular behavior of a cnidarian undergoes a transition from an ordered to a chaotic regime as temperature increases. This transition is characterized by intermittent behavior and may have implications for the response of cnidarians to climate change. The study suggests that elevated temperatures induce chaotic behavior in cnidarian gastrovascular systems, which may lead to large temporal variance of gas and nutrient concentrations and potential for irreversible damage.
