tldr: The authors describe and analyze two arthropod species, Emeraldella brocki and Leanchoilia superlata, found in the Burgess Shale from the Middle Cambrian period. They provide detailed information on the morphology, appendages, and possible habits of these creatures, which were benthonic predators and scavengers. The study also discusses the relationship between the two species and other arthropods from the same time period.
