tldr: The authors conducted manometric analysis on the metabolism of avian embryos, focusing on the effects of fluoride, iodoacetate, and other reagents on respiration. They discovered that iodoacetate completely inhibited the respiration of fourth-day chick embryos, while the yolk-sac showed a different metabolic response. The study provides insights into the chemical machinery of embryonic cells and their metabolic pathways.
