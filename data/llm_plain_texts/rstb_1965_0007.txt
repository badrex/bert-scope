tldr: The article explores the structure and function of the buccal nervous system in octopuses, focusing on the various nerve centers and pathways involved in the feeding process. It describes the roles of the superior buccal lobe, inferior buccal ganglia, and subradular ganglia in controlling the different stages of feeding, from visual approach to digestion. The study provides insights into the neural pathways and memory systems that underlie the feeding behavior of octopuses.
