tldr: Edmund Davy discovered a new fulminating platinum compound and analyzed its properties and composition. The compound was obtained through a series of chemical reactions and was found to explode when heated or subjected to friction. Davy also studied the composition of the compound, estimating the amount of ammonia it contains and detailing its decomposition process. The author concludes by discussing the theories behind the formation and decomposition of the compound and its explosive properties.
