tldr: The Ariel III satellite conducted experiments to study the worldwide distribution and occurrence of V.L.F. phenomena above the ionosphere. The research focused on observing signals transmitted from GBR (Rugby, UK) and NWC (Australia) and analyzing the effects of the ionosphere, magnetosphere, and magnetic storms on these signals. The findings provide valuable insights into the Earth's ionosphere and magnetosphere.
