tldr: This article discusses Signior Cassini's restoration of the Meridian Line in Bononia and the debate on whether the positions of meridians and parallels on Earth's surface have changed over time. Cassini's observations led him to believe that there has been no significant alteration, while others disagreed. The article also mentions the role of the Meridian Line in calculating refractions and the importance of accurate observations for astronomical studies.
