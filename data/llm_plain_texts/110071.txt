tldr: This paper presents experiments conducted by George Harvey to determine the influence of iron in ships on compass readings. He used a magnetized bar to measure the magnetic intensity at different locations on board several vessels. The results showed that the presence of iron in ships can affect compass readings, and the author discusses the properties of steel and its impact on the compass.
