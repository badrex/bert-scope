tldr: The authors conducted experiments on polycrystalline beryllium to study its cleavage strength and ductility transition temperature. They found that the cleavage strength is determined by the condition for the propagation of a microcrack that is an increasing multiple of the grain diameter. The ductility transition temperature can be explained by the intersection of a temperature-dependent flow stress with a temperature-independent cleavage strength. These findings can help improve the ductility of beryllium alloys.
