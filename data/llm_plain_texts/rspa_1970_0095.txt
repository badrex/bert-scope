tldr: The authors studied the kinetics of the reaction between atomic nitrogen and molecular oxygen in the ground and first excited states. They found that the reaction rate constant for the process is too slow at room temperature for it to be an important source of nitric oxide in the atmospheric region. The rate constant for the reaction at 302K was measured, and the results were compared with other atmospheric sources of nitric oxide.
