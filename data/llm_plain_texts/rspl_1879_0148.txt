tldr: The authors discovered a bacterium called Bacterium fœtidum, which is associated with profuse sweating and a strong odor from the soles of the feet. They studied the growth and development of this bacterium, finding it in the sweat-soaked areas of the feet. The bacterium can be found in pairs, single cells, and in various stages of development, including spores. The authors also found that Bacterium fœtidum grows less actively in turnip infusion compared to vitreous humor.
