tldr: This article discusses the relationship between ATP breakdown and muscular contraction and relaxation. The authors explore methods to measure ATP breakdown during muscle activity and consider the role of myosin and actomyosin in the process. They also discuss the possibility of ATP breakdown occurring during the relaxation phase and the potential connection to protein linkages.
