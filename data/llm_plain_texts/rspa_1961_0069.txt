tldr: The authors present a modified kinetic theory for the rate of nucleation in pure liquids, focusing on the kinetics of homogeneous nucleation in supercooled liquids. They derive a new expression for the nucleation time lag and discuss its implications for the freezing of supercooled liquids. The study highlights the importance of the initial distribution of subcritical embryos in determining the time required to establish a stationary nucleation rate.
