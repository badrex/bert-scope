tldr: The author investigates the effect of local attraction on the plumb-line at stations on the English Arc of the Meridian between Dunnose and Burleigh Moor. They develop a method to calculate the attraction and apply it to determine the deflection of the plumb-line at Burleigh Moor. The findings can be used to improve the accuracy of the English Survey and are important for understanding the figure of the Earth.
