  - Teleosts
tldr: The author investigates the osmotic changes in marine animals, focusing on teleosts, elasmobranchs, and invertebrates when placed in diluted sea water. The study shows that the osmotic pressure of the blood in these animals comes to nearly the same value as the external fluid, demonstrating the permeability of the membranes and the importance of active living processes in regulating osmotic pressure.
