tldr: This study simulates the distribution of residual flow and mean sea level variations in the southern North Sea using a two-dimensional, vertically integrated numerical model. The model examines the effects of major non-tidal phenomena, such as wind, density, and sea-surface gradients, and provides a comprehensive description of the residuals in the region. The results are compared with previous studies and measurements, showing good agreement and offering a framework for understanding the contribution of each forcing phenomenon to the residual flows and elevation gradients.
