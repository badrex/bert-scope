tldr: The authors investigated the effects of lowered intracellular pH on resting potassium currents in frog skeletal muscle fibers. They found that a reduction in pH revealed a component of current that was resistant to the channel blocker glibenclamide, suggesting that a decrease in pH can open ATP-dependent potassium channels in intact skeletal muscle fibers.
