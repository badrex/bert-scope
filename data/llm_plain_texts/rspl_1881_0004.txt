tldr: The authors conducted experiments on various animals to study the histology and physiology of pepsin-forming glands. They discovered that the granules in the gland cells are made up of zymogen, which is converted into pepsin during digestion. The processes in these glands are similar to those in the pancreatic gland, and the differences in cell activity between animals depend on the relative rates of the three processes: growth of protoplasm, formation of zymogen, and conversion of zymogen into secretory products.
