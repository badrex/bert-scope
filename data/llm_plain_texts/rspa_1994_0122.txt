tldr: This study examines the behavior of a viscous vortex ring using a matched asymptotic analysis. The researchers investigate how the location of maximum vorticity deviates from the centroid of the vortex ring. They find that the velocity of the centroid is constant, while the velocity of the maximum vorticity depends on the Reynolds number and may change slightly with time during the initial motion. The analysis also clarifies the earlier discrepancy between Saffman's result and that of Tung and Ting.
