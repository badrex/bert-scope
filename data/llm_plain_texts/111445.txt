tldr: This article discusses various physical properties of ice, such as its ability to conduct heat and its melting behavior. The author, John Tyndall, conducts experiments to understand how ice melts, the formation of air and water cavities, and the influence of pressure on ice. He also examines the conductivity of ice for heat and the melting point of ice under different conditions.
