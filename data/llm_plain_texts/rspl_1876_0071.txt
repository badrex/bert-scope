tldr: This article describes a method to investigate the changes in fixed corpuscles of the cornea during inflammation. The author demonstrates that the process mainly consists of the penetration of colorless corpuscles (migratory cells) that undergo active cell division. The findings provide evidence that the difference between a normal and inflamed cornea can be recognized by the presence of these migratory cells.
