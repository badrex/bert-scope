tldr: This article discusses recent advances in solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, focusing on the observation of high-resolution dipolar spectra in solids. The authors describe various techniques, including single-crystal and two-dimensional spectroscopy, to improve resolution and obtain dipolar spectra from powder samples. They also demonstrate the potential of NMR as a tool for determining molecular structure and discuss its applications in studying small molecules, amino acids, and peptides.
