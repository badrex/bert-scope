tldr: This article discusses the importance of incorporating atmospheric angular momentum (AAM) changes into diagnostic investigations of large-scale atmospheric flows. AAM fluctuations are generated by dynamical interactions between the atmosphere and the Earth, causing tiny but measurable changes in the Earth's rotation. Forecasts and analyses of AAM from global numerical weather prediction models serve as a stringent test of the model's accuracy, with potential applications in astronomy and geodesy.
