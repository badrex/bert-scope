tldr: The article discusses the palaeomagnetic data from the North and South China Blocks and examines the palaeomagnetic signatures relating to continental collision. The authors propose that the amalgamation of the North and South China Blocks was completed in the late Triassic-early Jurassic, during the Indosinian Orogeny. The Mesozoic collision between the two blocks reactivated ancient faults in eastern China, including the famous Tan-Lu fault.
