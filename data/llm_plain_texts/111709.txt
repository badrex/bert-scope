tldr: The author, A. W. Hofmann, conducted experiments on ethylene-diamine and its derivatives. He discovered that when ethylene-diamine reacts with iodide of ethyl, it forms a series of ethylated derivatives. The diethylated compound was of particular interest. Hofmann found that the vapour-density of the compound was 33-2, which supports the idea that the hydrated base splits into the anhydrous diamine and water. This research provides an experimental solution to the question of anomalous vapour-densities of hydrated diamines.
