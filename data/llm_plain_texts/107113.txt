tldr: The author, Thomas Young, reviews and extends Isaac Newton's work on the theory of light and colors. He proposes that a rare and elastic ethereal medium, called ether, pervades the universe and undulations are excited in this ether whenever a body becomes luminous. The sensation of different colors depends on the different frequencies of vibrations excited by light in the retina. This theory explains various phenomena, including the colors of thin plates and striated substances.
