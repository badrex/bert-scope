  - Migrating Systems
  - Equilibrium Constants
tldr: The authors discuss the benefits and dangers of pesticides, focusing on the use of constituent concepts in describing interaction boundaries in migrating systems. They explore the equilibrium constant and its implications for understanding chemical interactions and migration patterns in these systems. The study provides insights into the interpretation of future migration experiments and the theoretical understanding of these systems.
