tldr: The author, John Stenhouse, discovered that various vegetable substances, when acted upon by sulfuric or muriatic acid, produce oils. He found that these oils, furfurol and fucusol, have similar properties but are not identical. Furfurol is derived from the matiere incrustante of phanerogamous plants, while fucusol is derived from algae, mosses, and lichens. These findings reveal interesting botanical relationships and the potential for further study of these oils and their sources.
