tldr: The author conducted experiments on the magnetic properties of matter in strong magnetic fields, focusing on magnetostriction in dia- and para-magnetic substances. They studied the magnetostriction along the crystal axis and found that it follows the square law. The author also observed a more complicated magnetostriction phenomenon perpendicular to the crystal axis, which showed a deviation from the square law and a saturation effect at lower temperatures.
