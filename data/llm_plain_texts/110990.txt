tldr: The author, Carlo Matteucci, conducted experiments to study the influence of magnetism on polarized light and diamagnetism. He discovered that compressed heavy glass exhibits a different rotation when exposed to magnetism compared to uncompressed glass. Additionally, he found that magnetism does not have a significant effect on the rotation of other materials, such as compressed flint-glass or quartz. Matteucci also attempted to study the action of diamagnetic bodies on each other and on gaseous bodies but did not observe any significant results.
