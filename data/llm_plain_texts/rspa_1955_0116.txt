tldr: The authors studied the effects of high-energy radiation on polydimethyl siloxanes (silicone) polymers. They discovered that radiation can cross-link the polymer chains, forming insoluble structures with rubber-like properties. The relationship between cross-linking density and radiation dose was determined, and the authors found that unit-pile radiation cross-links about 50% of the monomer units, making silicone polymers an ideal material for studying radiation effects and polymer structure.
