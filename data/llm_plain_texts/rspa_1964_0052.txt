tldr: The author explores regular compound tessellations in the hyperbolic plane, describing five one-parameter families and seventeen isolated cases. These tessellations are formed by reflecting polygons in their sides, creating groups with the polygons as fundamental regions. The author also discusses the necessary conditions for the existence of regular compounds in the hyperbolic plane, using Gauss's formula for the area of a triangle to determine the area of each face.
