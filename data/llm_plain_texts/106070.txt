tldr: The author, William Hamilton, provides a detailed analysis of the soil and geological features of the Naples region, including the effects of volcanic eruptions on the landscape. He discusses the layers of soil and volcanic materials found in the area, such as pumice, lava, and burnt matter, and suggests that these layers are the result of a series of eruptions caused by subterranean fires. Hamilton also examines the growth of soil over time and the impact of volcanic activity on the surrounding environment.
