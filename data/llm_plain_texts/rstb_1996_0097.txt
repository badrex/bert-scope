tldr: This article reviews various concepts in community ecology, such as species richness, guild structure, niche, succession, and bionomic profiles, to better understand and predict the effects of environmental changes on natural communities. The author discusses the importance of habitat capacity, productivity, and structural complexity in determining community structure and highlights the need for further research to discover organizing principles and rules for predicting community changes.
