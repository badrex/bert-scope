tldr: The author describes a new pyrometer for measuring the expansion of metal bars due to heat. The instrument uses a micrometer screw to measure the contact between the metal bar and the instrument, allowing for precise measurements. The pyrometer is immersed in water heated to a specific temperature, ensuring consistent heat for the experiment. The author also discusses the importance of using a wooden bar with a known low expansion rate to determine the expansion of the instrument's basis between two given heat levels.
