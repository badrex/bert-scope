tldr: This article presents transient fundamental solutions for a transversely isotropic elastic half-space, which can be used in boundary integral equation methods and displacement discontinuity methods. The study focuses on two-dimensional and three-dimensional transient wave propagation problems and provides explicit general solutions for displacements and stresses. The solutions can be applied to various disciplines such as seismology, earthquake engineering, and geomechanics.
