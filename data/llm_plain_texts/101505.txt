tldr: The author describes a new experiment to produce a considerable degree of cold without the help of snow, ice, hail, wind, or niter. The experiment involves mixing saltpeter with water and observing the effects on temperature using a sealed weatherglass. This method can be used to cool drinks and potentially improve the cooling of air and other liquids.
