tldr: Joseph Whidbey discovered fossil bones in caverns enclosed in limestone rocks at Plymouth. These bones were found in a dry and clean cavern without any communication with the surface. The bones were identified as the grinder of the upper jaw of the single-horned rhinoceros and are now deposited in the Museum of the College of Surgeons.
