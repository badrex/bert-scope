tldr: This article investigates the thermal decomposition of ethyl ether on the surface of platinum. The authors found that the reaction occurs homogeneously in a thin layer of hot gas surrounding the platinum filament, and the platinum does not act as a catalyst. The results are similar to those for the homogeneous decomposition, except that the pressure at which the velocity constant falls off increases with decreasing temperature.
