tldr: The article describes two types of thermometers designed to measure extreme heat. The first thermometer features a capillary tube that fills with spirit of wine when the temperature drops, allowing for precise measurement of the highest temperature reached. The second thermometer uses a syphon design with two legs, one longer and one shorter, to measure both the highest and lowest temperatures experienced. These innovative thermometers help improve accuracy and reliability in temperature measurements.
