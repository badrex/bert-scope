tldr: The authors develop a probability model for fibrous composites with local load sharing, focusing on the chain-of-bundles model. They derive an approximation for the probability of failure and provide formulae for predicting the strength of the composite. The study relies on extreme value theory and an asymptotic theory, with the Monte Carlo method used to analyze a specific case.
