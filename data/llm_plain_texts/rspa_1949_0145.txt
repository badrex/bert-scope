tldr: The authors conducted experiments using a mass spectrometer to study the pyrolysis of methane, ethane, and n-butane on a platinum filament. They detected free radicals and observed the reactions and products formed. The results showed that methane dissociated into methyl radicals, while ethane and n-butane underwent molecular dehydrogenation and selective fission, respectively. The study provided insights into the mechanisms of hydrocarbon pyrolysis and the role of catalysts in these reactions.
