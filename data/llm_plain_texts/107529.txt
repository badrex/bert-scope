tldr: The author, W. H. Wollaston, examines a mass of native iron found in Brazil and determines that it contains nickel, suggesting a meteoric origin. The author also analyzes the proportion of nickel in the iron and compares it to other known meteoric specimens. The iron's magnetic properties and the presence of oxidation support the idea that it is a meteorite that has been exposed to Earth's atmosphere for an extended period.
