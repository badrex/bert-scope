tldr: The study investigates the effects of excitatory amino acids, such as -glutamate, -aspartate, and kainate, on rod horizontal cells in the dogfish retina using iontophoresis. The results show that -glutamate and kainate are of equal potency in depolarizing rod horizontal cells, while -aspartate is about one-tenth as potent. The study also finds that at least two molecules of agonist are required to open a cationic channel, and the cells do not become desensitized to long or repeated exposures of the agonists.
