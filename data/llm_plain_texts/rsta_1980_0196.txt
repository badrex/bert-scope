tldr: The author analyzes the orbit of the Skylab 1 rocket, which entered a nearly circular orbit at a height of 400 km in 1973. The orbit was determined using various observations, and the author found that the satellite passed through the 31:2 geopotential resonance, allowing them to analyze variations in eccentricity and inclination. The results provided crucial tests for geopotential models and confirmed the accuracy of atmospheric rotation rates at different heights.
