tldr: The author's experiments reveal that earthworms, particularly Eisenia foetida, play a significant role in transmitting gapeworm disease to birds. They found that these worms act as reservoirs of infection and can be a danger to young chickens raised on contaminated land. The study also shows that Lumbricus terrestris can carry the disease but with less severity compared to Eisenia foetida.
