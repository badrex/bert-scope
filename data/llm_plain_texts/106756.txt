tldr: The author, Richard Kirwan, examines the effect of temperature on the specific gravities of substances and proposes a method to reduce them to a common standard. He finds that the expansion of water is not proportional to the degrees of heat and that specific gravities of solids change with temperature. The author suggests using a simple analogy to correct for these temperature variations and obtain accurate weights and specific gravities.
