tldr: The authors analyze the optical emission spectra of dwarf galaxies to determine the primordial helium abundance (7P) created during the Big Bang. They find that the mean 7P from the 26 best-observed dwarf galaxies is approximately 0.24, with a possible upper limit of 0.26. The study highlights the importance of searching for more dwarf galaxies with low metal abundances to improve the accuracy of helium abundance determinations.
