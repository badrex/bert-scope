tldr: The author presents an efficient method for limit analysis using the ellipsoid yield surface, which can be applied to various engineering materials. The method is based on the classical kinematic theorem of plasticity and the finite element technique. A discrete mathematical programming formula is introduced, and an efficient algorithm is used to solve the problem. The algorithm produces a load multiplier sequence that converges to the exact limit load, providing an upper bound for the real limit load of the body.
