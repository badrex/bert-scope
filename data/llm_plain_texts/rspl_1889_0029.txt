tldr: The authors studied the absorption spectra of oxygen and its compounds under various pressures and temperatures. They discovered that the absorption bands of gaseous and liquid oxygen are the same, and that the absorption of oxygen is not affected by the presence of nitrogen. The study also found that the absorption spectrum of ozone is different from that of oxygen, and that the limit of the solar spectrum may be determined by the amount of ozone in the atmosphere.
