tldr: This article analyzes the scattering of bending waves by open and closed cracks and joints in a fluid-loaded elastic plate. The study examines the efficiency of sound generation by straight, open joints and compares it to closed joints. The results show that the acoustic power scattered at a crack is significantly increased when the crack is open, while for an open joint with clamped edges, the efficiency with which sound is generated is marginally reduced relative to the closed joint.
