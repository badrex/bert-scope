tldr: The authors describe a method to measure the diffusion of excitons in anthracene, an aromatic hydrocarbon, and observe their migration across a thin specimen. They apply this method experimentally and find that the observed diffusion length is 460 Å, which suggests that exciton migration occurs most easily between molecules in adjacent b-c planes in the graphite-like structure of anthracene.
