tldr: This article discusses an experiment conducted by Sir William Thiselton-Dyer and Professor Dewar, where they cooled various seeds in liquid hydrogen to extremely low temperatures and found that they still germinated successfully. The experiment provides insight into the resilience of plant life and the potential for seed preservation in extreme conditions.
