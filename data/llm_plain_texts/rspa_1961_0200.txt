tldr: The authors conducted experiments with isotopic molecules to study energy transfer in polyatomic molecules. They discovered that small amounts of isotopic molecules act as energy transfer catalysts for ethylene. The study provides insights into the mechanisms of energy transfer and its implications for general theories of catalysis.
