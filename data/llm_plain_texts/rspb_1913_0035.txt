tldr: The author conducted experiments with the bacteria Bacillus coli, exposing them to the dye Brilliant Green. They discovered that two permanent varieties arose from one original organism under these conditions. One variety was slightly modified by the dye and remained resistant, while the other underwent profound and progressive changes. This study highlights the potential for variation in organisms and the possibility of acquiring new traits through environmental factors.
