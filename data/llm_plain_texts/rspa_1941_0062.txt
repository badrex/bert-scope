tldr: This article presents measurements of thermal diffusion in hydrogen-deuterium mixtures and discusses the relationship between the thermal diffusion ratio and the molecular interactions within the mixtures. The authors find that the force index, which describes the molecular repulsive field, is consistent with previous viscosity measurements. The results suggest that the interactions between hydrogen and deuterium molecules are similar, allowing for a more accurate estimation of the force index from thermal diffusion measurements.
