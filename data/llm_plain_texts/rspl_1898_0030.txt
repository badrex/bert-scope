tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the amount of heat produced by the human body and how it relates to the consumption of food. They found that the mean heat production was the same for different individuals and that there is a definite relationship between the absorption of oxygen and the production of heat. The authors also observed that the body's heat production generally increased after a meal.
