tldr: This study examines the intertidal zonation of animals and plants on the rocky shores of Aldabra Atoll, focusing on the physical factors that influence their distribution. The research discusses the climate, wave action, tides, temperature, insolation, and desiccation affecting the organisms in the intertidal zone. The authors describe the three main zones recognized in the area: the littoral fringe, the eulittoral zone, and the sublittoral zone. The study provides valuable insights into the complex interplay of environmental factors shaping the intertidal ecosystem at Aldabra Atoll.
