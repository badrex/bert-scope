tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments to study the refraction of plane polarized light at the surface of a uniaxial crystal, using the principles of electromagnetism. They discovered that the angle of incidence and the deviation of the refracted light can be used to determine the position of the plane of polarization of the incident light. The results were compared with the predictions of the electromagnetic theory, providing a test of the theory's accuracy.'
