tldr: This article investigates the effect of pressure on the spectra of flames, particularly the emission spectra of hydrogen and the continuous spectrum of oxy-hydrogen flames. The authors found that increased pressure led to a more stable flame with a larger proportion of steam and a higher temperature. They also observed that the presence of sodium increased the continuous spectrum of the flame under pressure.
