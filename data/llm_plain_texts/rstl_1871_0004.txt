tldr: 'Charles Tomlinson investigates the role of nuclei in separating supersaturated saline solutions. He explains that a nucleus is a body with a stronger attraction for the gas, vapor, or salt of a solution than for the liquid holding it. A clean surface is crucial for a body to act as a nucleus. Tomlinson also discusses the behavior of liquids in forming films and their nuclear action. He concludes that a clean, catharized surface is necessary for a substance to act as a nucleus, while a contaminated surface can lead to separation of gas, vapor, or salt from the solution.'
