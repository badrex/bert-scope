tldr: The author describes an experiment by Papin involving the use of an air pump. The experiment demonstrates how air pressure forces water to rise in a glass container. The author explains the mechanics of the experiment, including the movement of air and water, and suggests that the experiment could be improved by sealing the container more tightly.
