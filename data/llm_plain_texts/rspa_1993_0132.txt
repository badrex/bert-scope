tldr: The authors explore various choices of the zero-order term in the perturbative analysis of harmonic oscillators with nonlinear perturbations, focusing on the unforced Duffing oscillator. They demonstrate that the choice of'minimal normal forms' leads to the best results in terms of convergence properties, and discuss other possible choices for the free functions in the analysis.
