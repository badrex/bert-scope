tldr: This study investigates the dielectric permittivity and pvT data of six n-alkanes, from pentane to decane, to understand their molecular behavior. The molecular polarizability decreases with increasing density in a nonlinear manner, and it displays a temperature effect that alternates between large and small values for odd and even numbers in the series. The findings provide insights into the molecular properties of n-alkanes and the interplay between density, temperature, and pressure.
