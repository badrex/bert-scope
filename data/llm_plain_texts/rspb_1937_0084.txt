tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the response of nerve to subthreshold stimulation. They discovered that a localized response, called a non-conducted response, can occur when a small region of nerve is excited by a subthreshold shock. This response can be facilitated by a second shock applied to the same region shortly after the first and is accompanied by a small local action potential. The findings provide insights into the mechanisms of nerve excitation and the propagation of electrical signals in the nervous system.
