tldr: In 1748, the Earl of Morton, Mr. le Monnier, and Ja. Short observed an annular solar eclipse from Aberdour Castle. They used various telescopes and instruments to measure the eclipse's progression and collected data on the moon's surface features. They also noted the surrounding weather conditions and the appearance of Venus during the event. This observation helped improve the understanding of celestial mechanics and lunar geology.
