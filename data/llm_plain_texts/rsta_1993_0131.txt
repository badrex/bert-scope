tldr: The author presents a new theory to describe the baroclinic dynamics of density-driven currents and fronts over a sloping continental shelf. The model includes geostrophic frontal dynamics, quasigeostrophic evolution of the underlying slope water, and baroclinic vortex-tube stretching. The author analyzes the linear and nonlinear stability of the model, providing a comprehensive understanding of the stability characteristics of density-driven currents and fronts in coastal regions.
