tldr: The author provides a detailed study of the structure and function of the mouthparts of Phryganea striata L., a type of adult caddis fly. They also conduct a comparative analysis of mouthparts in 53 species representing each of the 13 families found in Britain. The study reveals that all species have a protrusible haustellum, which functions as an organ for taking up liquids. The most highly developed condition is seen in the Phryganeidae and Limnephilidae families.
