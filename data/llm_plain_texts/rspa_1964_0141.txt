tldr: The authors study the behavior of bubbles in insulating liquids when subjected to an electric field. They find that bubbles assume the shape of a prolate spheroid in the direction of the field and derive equations for the dependence of bubble shape on electric stress. The results show that field strength increases, causing bubbles to elongate until a critical shape is reached when the bubble becomes unstable. The implications of these findings with regard to electrical breakdown of liquids are discussed.
