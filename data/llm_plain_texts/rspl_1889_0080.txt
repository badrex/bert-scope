tldr: This memoir extends the theory of symmetric functions to systems of algebraic quantities, exploring the properties of symmetric functions and their applications to the solutions of systems of equations. The author demonstrates the relationship between algebraic operations and differential operations, and establishes a connection between the theory of separations and the theory of invariants.
