tldr: The author, Browne Langrish, presents a new method for distillation that prevents the breaking of glassware due to air pressure. This method involves using multiple receivers to collect volatile substances and allows for more precise control over the distillation process. The author believes this improvement could be useful in analyzing substances like blood and suggests considering presenting this method to the Royal Society.
