tldr: This study investigates the enigma of microtubule coils in brain synaptosomes. The researchers found that incubation of brain synaptosomes in Krebs solution produces a remarkable coil of microtubules, which is structurally different from the microtubules seen in 'intact' synapses. The function of these coil microtubules remains enigmatic, while the microtubules seen in albumin-treated synapses could have a role in synaptic vesicle translocation.
