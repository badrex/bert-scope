tldr: This review lecture discusses the importance of accuracy in processing and replicating the genetic code. It explores the editing mechanisms and proofreading activities that ensure high specificity in protein synthesis and DNA replication, preventing errors that could lead to mutations and cell deterioration. The lecture also touches upon the relationship between accuracy and the forces responsible for the folding and assembly of proteins.
