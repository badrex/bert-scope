revised_title: 'Investigating Plant Respiration in Seeds with Predominant Carbohydrate Reserves'

  - Seed metabolism
  - Respiratory quotient
tldr: This study investigates the respiration rates and respiratory quotients of germinating seeds with carbohydrate reserves, such as Fagopyrum esculentum, Zea mais, and Lathyrus odoratus. The researchers found that changing the surrounding atmosphere from air to nitrogen and back affects the seeds' respiration rates and respiratory quotients. The results provide insights into seed metabolism during germination.
