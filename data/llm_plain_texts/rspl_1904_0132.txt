tldr: The author presents a method for calculating corrections to naval range tables for different air densities and muzzle velocities. The method involves adjusting elevations and ranges based on the ratio of air densities and muzzle velocities. The author also discusses a simple approximation for the correction of elevation due to air density and the design of a gun-sight system that automatically corrects for various errors.
