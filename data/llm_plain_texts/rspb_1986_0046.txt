tldr: This study investigates the life history variation in Celleporella hyalina (Bryozoan) and how water flow and genetic factors affect colony growth, reproductive output, and sex ratio. The results show that water flow has a significant impact on colony growth rate and the number of reproductive zooids produced, while genetic factors play a role in the allocation of resources to male and female functions. This variation may reflect the limitations of normalizing selection imposed by microenvironmental variability.
