tldr: The author explores the thermodynamics of electron emission, focusing on the equilibrium of electron atmospheres in contact with matter. They derive equations and discuss the pressure of electrons, intrinsic potential, latent heat, and temperature in various phases. The study provides insights into thermionic emission at melting and transition points, contributing to the understanding of thermionic phenomena and thermoelectricity.
