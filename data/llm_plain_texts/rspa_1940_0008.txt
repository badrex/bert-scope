tldr: This article presents a theoretical method to calculate the specific heats of solids and liquids using interatomic forces and the concept of disorder. The authors apply their model to rare gases, predicting a decrease in specific heat with temperature, in agreement with experimental results. The theory also accounts for the phenomenon of melting and provides insights into the behavior of specific heat in solid rare gases and liquids.
