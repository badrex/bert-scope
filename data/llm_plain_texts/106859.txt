tldr: The author, Everard Home, presents two case studies of women with rare, horn-like excrescences growing on their heads. These excrescences originated from cysts and were made of a hard, horny substance. The author discusses the history, symptoms, and causes of this unusual condition, which was not well understood at the time. This research contributes to the understanding of medical anomalies and human physiology.
