tldr: This Croonian lecture discusses the physiological aspects of animal locomotion, focusing on the role of the central nervous system. The author explores the principles of reciprocal inhibition and rhythm of activity between antagonist and protagonist muscles. The lecture also examines the role of higher nervous centers and the localization of locomotory areas in the brain, as well as the effects of spinal transection on animal movement.
