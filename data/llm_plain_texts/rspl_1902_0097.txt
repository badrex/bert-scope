tldr: The authors studied the decline of the injury current in mammalian nerve and its modification by changes in temperature. They proposed the "concentration cell" theory, which suggests that differences in the solutions within the nerve cause electrical differences upon injury. The authors found that temperature plays a significant role in the injury current, with a specific temperature range maintaining the best E.M.F. value.
