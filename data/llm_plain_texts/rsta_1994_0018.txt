tldr: The authors study the compactness properties of solutions in nonlinear systems, specifically the Boltzmann and Landau equations. They demonstrate that solutions of the Landau equation have a striking compactness property, which does not hold for the Boltzmann equation with an angular cut-off. This research is crucial for understanding the global existence of weak solutions in nonlinear systems.
