tldr: The authors present improvements in the use of relaxation methods for solving ordinary and partial differential equations. They develop methods that allow the full difference equations to be used, reducing the number of mesh points and increasing accuracy. The method is applied to various examples, including ordinary and partial differential equations, eigen-value problems, and problems with curved boundaries.
