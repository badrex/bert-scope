tldr: The authors investigate the factors that induce sporulation in mould fungi, particularly in Penicillium griseofulvum and P. chrysogenum. They find that sporulation is rapidly induced in submerged conditions when mycelium is placed in a medium containing a high concentration of glucose without assimilable nitrogen. External Mg2+, K+, and PO4 are also required for sporulation. The most powerful stimulus to sporulation comes from the emergence of mycelium from submerged to aerial conditions, which causes a sharp change in physiological behavior. The primary aerial stimulus to sporulation is associated with a physical change at the cell surface caused by the abrupt formation of an air/water interface.
