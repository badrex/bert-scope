tldr: The author, Henry Cavendish, conducted experiments on Rathbone-Place water to study its chemical composition and properties. He discovered that the water contains a high amount of calcareous earth and magnesia, as well as a small quantity of volatile alkali. The water also does not contain any nitrous salt, which is a remarkable finding compared to other London waters. Additionally, Cavendish found that Rathbone-Place water contains fixed air, as demonstrated through an experiment using a contrivance with inverted funnels and bottles.
