tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the chemical mechanism of gastric secretion. They found that certain substances, such as extracts from the pyloric mucous membrane, can stimulate the stomach to secrete gastric juice. They also discovered that the active principle in these extracts, which they called "gastrin," is not destroyed by boiling. This research supported the idea that the nervous mechanism of the gastric glands may be susceptible to local chemical stimuli.
