tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the absorption, ionization, and secondary radiation of X-rays in various gases and vapours. They found that the ionization in the gas is proportional to the pressure, and the energy of the penetrating secondary radiation is also proportional to the pressure. The results provide insights into the behavior of X-rays and their interactions with different materials.
