tldr: This article discusses the use of pulsars as laboratories for studying fundamental physics, focusing on pulsar demography and neutron star astrophysics. Pulsars, particularly millisecond and binary pulsars, offer unique opportunities to test physics and understand the formation and evolution of neutron stars. The statistics of pulsars are crucial for detecting a cosmic gravity wave background and estimating detection frequencies and thresholds. The article also explores the importance of magnetic field strengths of pulsars and their relation to physics and astrophysics.
