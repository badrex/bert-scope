tldr: The study investigates the incidence of neurovertebral defects in curly-tail mice and their similarity to human neural tube defects. The research found that the incidence of defects in the current curly-tail mouse strain is similar to that observed 25 years ago. The study also highlights the phenotypic similarities between the mouse condition and human neural tube defects, such as an excess of females, polyhydramnios, hydrocephaly, high levels of amniotic fluid alpha-fetoprotein, and distinctive rapidly adhering cells in the amniotic fluid. The results suggest that curly-tail mice can be a useful model for investigating neural tube defects in humans.
