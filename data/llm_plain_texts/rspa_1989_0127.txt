tldr: This article investigates the nonlinear evolution of stability waves in subsonic mixing layers with symmetric mean temperature profiles. The study focuses on the high Reynolds number limit, where viscous and thermal diffusion effects dominate in the critical layer. The authors provide an analytical expression for the Landau constant and other constants in the nonlinear evolution equation for the amplitude of the eigenmode. They find that temperature excess or deficit at the critical level and the Mach number have a strong nonlinear effect on the stability of the mixing layers.
