tldr: The authors investigate the oscillation spectra of ultra compact stars, focusing on polar and axial modes. They find that the characteristic frequencies of these modes approach each other as the star becomes more compact, and that both modes are essentially spacetime modes. This study helps to understand the origin of various oscillation modes of relativistic stars.
