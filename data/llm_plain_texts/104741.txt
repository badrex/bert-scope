tldr: The author, Stephen Hales, explores the possible natural causes of earthquakes and their connection to atmospheric phenomena. He suggests that the mixture of fresh air with sulfurous vapors in the atmosphere can cause violent agitation and effervescence, which may lead to earthquakes. Hales also discusses the relationship between lightning, sulfurous vapors, and the elasticity of air, which can result in hurricanes and thunderstorms.
