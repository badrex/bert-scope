tldr: This paper extends and simplifies the Hardy-Littlewood integral inequality by considering a more general form of the inequality involving the Titchmarsh-Weyl m-coefficient of the associated differential equation. The results show that the inequality holds under minimal conditions on the coefficients and determine the best possible constant K and all cases of equality. The paper also discusses the progress made in studying the inequality and its applications.
