tldr: This article discusses the application of time-series analysis and fractal geometry to study the dynamics of nonlinear systems, such as chemical reactions, fluid flows, and electronic oscillators. The authors review methods to extract geometrical information from time-series data and apply these techniques to experimental and model systems, focusing on the fractal properties of chaotic attractors.
