tldr: The author investigates the supposed "new force" described by M. J. Thore, who claimed to have demonstrated a new force inherent in the human organism through the rotation of an ivory cylinder. The author replicates Thore's experiment and finds that the rotation always takes place in a consistent direction, regardless of the observer's position. The author also explores various factors that may affect the rotation, such as the materials used for the cylinders and pillars, and the presence of heat. The results suggest that the observed rotation may be influenced by the human observer, rather than being solely due to a new force.
