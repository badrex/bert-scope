tldr: The author, Mr. Douglas, conducted geographical and physical observations on the western coast of North America, focusing on the Columbia River and its tributaries, as well as California. He selected junctions of rivers and other well-characterized natural points as stations for geographical determination. Unfortunately, he lost most of his collections and papers during his journey. Major Edward Sabine later reported on Douglas's work and shared the preserved books and observations.
