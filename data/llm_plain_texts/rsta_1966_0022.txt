tldr: This study investigates the propagation of ocean swell across the Pacific Ocean using wave stations along a great circle between New Zealand and Alaska. The authors analyze energy spectra to track events from major storms and find that the observed propagation can be explained by the effects of Stokes interaction between wave groups from a single storm. The results show negligible attenuation for frequencies below 70 mc/s and a uniform background spectrum across the Pacific, likely due to global high winds along the storm belt of the South Pacific.
