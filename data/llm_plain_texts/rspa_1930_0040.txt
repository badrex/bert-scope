tldr: The authors describe the synthesis of antimonial analogues of the carbazole series, where antimony replaces nitrogen in the carbazole nucleus. They prepare o-aminodiphenyl, convert it into antimony tetrachloride, and then synthesize various xenyl-o-stibine derivatives. These compounds are analogues of the arsenical carbazole series and have potential applications in organic chemistry.
