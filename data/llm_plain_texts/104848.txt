tldr: Dr. Gronovius discovered a remarkable fish species called Mustela fossilis, also known as Cobites caerulescens, living in the sands near Wesel in Holland. These fish can survive for a long time without changing water or food, as they feed on what the water provides. This discovery expanded the understanding of aquatic ecosystems and fish biology.
