tldr: This article discusses the thermodynamics of elasticity in biological tissues, specifically focusing on muscle fibre bundles and their response to ATP. The author explores the effects of a factor discovered by Marsh that modifies muscle fibre response to ATP, leading to changes in fibre volume and extensibility. The findings suggest that this factor may play a role in controlling myosin enzymatic function in resting muscle.
