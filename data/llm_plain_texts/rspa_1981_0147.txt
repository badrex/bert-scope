tldr: The authors study isocirculational flows, which are steady flows with the same circulation invariants, and develop a new energy principle that incorporates these invariants. They demonstrate that all states of steady flow are stationary states of an energy functional, which can be minimized to determine stability. This work generalizes Rayleigh's energy principle to include non-axially symmetric systems and perturbations, while still considering barotropic fluids.
