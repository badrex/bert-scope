tldr: The authors investigate the nature of the reconstruction of the Ni(100) surface under the influence of a carbon overlayer using phonon spectroscopy and lattice dynamical analysis. They find that the second derivative of the pair potential between the first- and second-layer nickel atoms is sensitive to the adsorbed species, leading to a reconstruction pattern. The authors also explore the possibility of adsorbate-induced compression within the first layer as a cause of the observed reconstruction.
