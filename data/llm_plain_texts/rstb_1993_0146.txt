tldr: Arabidopsis thaliana has become a popular model organism for studying plant genetics due to its small genome size and ease of genetic analysis. The development of efficient insertional mutagenesis systems and a physical map has facilitated the cloning of numerous plant genes, leading to a better understanding of processes such as flowering, environmental responses, and plant-pathogen interactions.
