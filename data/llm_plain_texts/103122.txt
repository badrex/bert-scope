tldr: The author, Dr. Hugh Todd, shares his observations and findings about ancient antiquities discovered at Corbridge in Northumberland. He discusses the discovery of an altar dedicated to Hercules, as well as bones and teeth found nearby. He speculates that these bones may belong to large animals, such as oxen, that were sacrificed at the altar, rather than being from a giant human as some had suggested. He also suggests that the name "Colchester" may have been derived from "Hercul-ceaster."
