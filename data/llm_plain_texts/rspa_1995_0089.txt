semantic_tags:
  - Seismic sources
  - Shock wave physics
  - Seismic wave generation
  - Shear-wave energy
  - Seismic exploration
tldr: The authors discuss the free shock wave as a seismic source, highlighting its advantages and potential for generating both compressional and shear waves. This source can be tailored to enhance specific seismic wave propagation characteristics in sediments, making it useful for hydrocarbon exploration and identifying geological structures containing fluids.
