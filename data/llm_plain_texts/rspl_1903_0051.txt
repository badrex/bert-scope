tldr: The author investigates the relations between the aberrations of a lens system with a front stop and the compound system formed by two such systems symmetrically disposed with respect to the stop. They use Hamilton's characteristic function adapted by Maxwell and express the optical length between points in the medium. The author finds that it is impossible to exactly satisfy all aberration conditions, but they provide methods to obtain the minimum residual error for a given stop and field. They also discuss the conditions for stigmatic correction and no distortion in symmetrical objectives.
