tldr: The authors study the detonation of solid explosives, focusing on the equilibrium conditions in the detonation wave-front and the adiabatic expansion of the products of detonation. They develop equations to calculate the pressure, volume, and temperature in the detonation wave-front and analyze the adiabatic expansion process. The study provides insights into the composition of detonation products and the behavior of solid explosives.
