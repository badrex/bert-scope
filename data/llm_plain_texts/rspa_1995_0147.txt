tldr: This article presents a solution for the acoustic and structural scattered response from the junction of two flat plates under unilateral fluid loading. The plates are modeled using the classical theory of flexure, and the solution is found using the Wiener-Hopf technique for the dual integral equations for the unknown pressure on the plates. Explicit formulae are obtained for the pressure transform when the plates are in welded or clamped contact, and corresponding expressions are given for the various diffraction coefficients associated with the fluid-structure interaction.
