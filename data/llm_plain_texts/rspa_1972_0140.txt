tldr: The authors studied the structure and reaction kinetics of rich hydrogen-nitrogen-oxygen flames. They extended the existing reaction mechanism to better explain the properties of flames with different initial compositions. The new mechanism includes additional chain-breaking steps involving hydroxyl radicals and oxygen atoms, which help improve the agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental measurements. This research provides a better understanding of flame behavior and can be applied to improve combustion processes.
