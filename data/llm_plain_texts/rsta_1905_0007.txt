tldr: The authors investigated the electrical conductivity and other properties of sodium hydroxide in aqueous solutions. They found that the conductivity of concentrated solutions is higher than what can be explained by the direct influence of the solvent alone, suggesting that the dissolved salt contributes to the conductivity. The study also revealed that the degree of association between the solvent and solute reaches a maximum at dilutions close to those required for complete ionization.
