tldr: The authors found that poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) is utilized by bacteroids in soybean root nodules during periods of darkness or when deprived of host-stored energy sources. This utilization helps sustain the oxygen demand of the bacteroids, preserving nodule activity and continuing nitrogen fixation during seed development.
