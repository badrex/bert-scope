tldr: The authors explore the constitutive equations for resilient materials, which describe the stress tensor in terms of kinematic tensors that define deformation and its time rates of variation. They focus on isotropic bodies and discuss the dynamic properties of resilient materials, including the phenomenon of dynamic hysteresis, which occurs in rubber-like materials. The study assumes that the mechanical properties can be represented by an expression for the stress tensor as a polynomial in the deformation and its first time rate of variation.
