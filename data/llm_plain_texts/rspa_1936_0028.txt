tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the reflexion coefficient of the ionosphere for wireless waves. They developed a method to calculate the transmission coefficient, which helped them determine the reflexion coefficient and absorption suffered by the waves. The results provided insights into the factors influencing absorption and allowed them to estimate the collisional frequency of electrons with gas molecules in the upper atmosphere.
