tldr: The authors study the lower limiting crystallite size and internal strains in cold-worked metals using X-ray diffraction. They find that the crystallites formed during deformation have a lower limit size and that the lattice dimensions change during the deformation process. The results show that cold-worked metals have two extremes: a stable state with a contracted lattice and a less stable state with an expanded lattice. The authors also observe that the recovered state, with its contracted lattice, provides the amount of residual line broadening due to the Scherrer effect, which corresponds to the lower limit of the crystallite size.
