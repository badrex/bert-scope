tldr: Faraday's experiments detail the process of condensing various gases into liquids, including sulphurous acid, sulphuretted hydrogen, carbonic acid, euchlorine, nitrous oxide, cyanogen, ammonia, muriatic acid, and chlorine. The gases were released from their compounds in small glass tubes and then condensed using ice or freezing mixtures. The resulting liquids were colorless, mobile fluids that returned to their gaseous state when pressure was removed.
