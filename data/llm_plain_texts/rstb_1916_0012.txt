tldr: The authors conducted a detailed analysis of the Dicynodon skull structure using a specimen from the Karoo beds of South Africa. They observed the occiput, palate, ethmoidal, and otic regions, and provided insights into the interparietal bone, carotid canal, squamosal, quadrate, quadrato-jugal, and columella auris. The study contributes to the understanding of the Dicynodon skull's morphology and evolution.
