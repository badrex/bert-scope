tldr: This study examines the influence of sexual selection on genital anatomy in male primates, specifically focusing on penile spines. The authors find that penile spines are more common in prosimians with dispersed or paired social systems and less common in anthropoids with multi-male or single-male systems. They consider various functions of penile spines, such as locking during copulation, enhancing scent communication, and stimulating reproductive readiness, but conclude that further research is needed to fully understand their role in primate evolution.
