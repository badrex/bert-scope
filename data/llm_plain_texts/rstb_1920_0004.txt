tldr: The author presents an evolutionary classification of Cretaceous Cribrimorph Polyzoa, focusing on the subfamily Pelmatoporinae. They describe the morphology, evolution, and stratigraphical distribution of the group, and compare their findings with those of W.K. Spencer's work on Cretaceous Asteroidea. The author concludes that the evolutionary aim of the group is the deposition of calcium carbonate, which eventually leads to the extinction of some lineages.
