tldr: This article examines the distribution and character of 'connecting threads' in the tissues of Pinus sylvestris and other related species. The authors found that these threads are present in young tissues and play a crucial role in connecting cells and facilitating the passage of materials between cells. They also observed that threads are less common in lignified or suberized tissues. The research provides valuable insights into the structure and function of plant tissues, particularly in the Pinus genus.
