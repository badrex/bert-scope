tldr: The author analyzes the daily range of the magnetic declination at Kew Observatory from 1858 to 1873, finding a connection between the variations and solar activity. They compare the data with sunspot records and observe a correlation between the two, suggesting that solar activity influences Earth's magnetic field.
