tldr: This article discusses the experimental technique and results of measuring electron temperature and concentration using probes on the Ariel I satellite. The method, developed by P. J. Bowen and colleagues, is more sensitive and offers advantages for measurements made from a spacecraft. The technique was applied to study ionospheric electrons, investigate energy distribution, and measure electron density and temperature throughout the ionosphere covered by the satellite's orbit.
