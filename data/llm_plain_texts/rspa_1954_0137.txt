tldr: The article investigates the response of laminar skin friction and heat transfer to fluctuations in the stream velocity. It analyzes the boundary layer in two-dimensional flow around a cylindrical body when the velocity of the oncoming flow oscillates in magnitude but not in direction. The study finds that the maxima of skin friction anticipate the maxima of the stream velocity, while heat transfer fluctuations tend to lag behind. The research also calculates the frictional component of the virtual mass and its effects on thin obstacles in a fluid.
