tldr: This study investigates the relationship between friction and adhesion in steel sliding on indium in air. The results show that both normal and tangential stresses play a role in the deformation of metal junctions formed at the interface. The friction and adhesion increase together as relative motion occurs between the slider and the indium surface. The findings emphasize the importance of metallic junctions in both friction and adhesion, and the role of lubricant films in reducing these forces.
