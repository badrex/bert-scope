revised_title: 'Effect of Temperature on Polysaccharide Content in Bacterial Cultures'

tldr: The author investigates the effect of temperature on the polysaccharide content in bacterial cultures, specifically in Bact. lactis aerogenes. They found that higher levels of polysaccharide are obtained at 25 and 37°C, while at 42°C, the synthesis of excess polysaccharide is impaired. The author also examines the use of excess polysaccharide as a sole source of carbon in a succeeding cycle and concludes that it is not as much a reserve as a consequence of abnormal metabolism.
