tldr: The author proposes a new method for measuring the parallax of fixed stars, which could help determine their distances from Earth. By observing double stars at different altitudes and accounting for atmospheric refraction, the author believes that annual parallax can be measured with greater accuracy. This method could lead to a better understanding of the distances and properties of stars in the universe.
