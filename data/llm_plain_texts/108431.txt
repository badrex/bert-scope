tldr: In this article, Michael Faraday conducts experiments to investigate the polarity of diamagnetic and magnetic substances. He uses a unique apparatus to test the influence of these substances on an experimental helix and galvanometer. Although the experiments do not confirm the existence of polarity in these substances, they provide valuable insights into the behavior of diamagnetic and magnetic materials under different conditions.
