semantic_tags:

  - Muscle contraction
  - Histology
tldr: The author examines the structure of insect wing muscles, specifically the muscle-columns or sarco-styles, and their behavior under different conditions. They discover that these muscle-columns are made up of continuous substance with tubular canals, and the longitudinal striation is due to this canalization. The author also explains the physical changes that occur during muscle contraction and extension.
