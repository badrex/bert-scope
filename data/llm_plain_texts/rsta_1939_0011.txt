tldr: This study examines the crystallographic properties of meteoric iron, focusing on the Widmanstatten structure and the axes of the octahedrite. The research involves analyzing the orientations of kamacite and taenite crystals in the Diablo meteorite using X-ray diffraction. The findings contribute to the understanding of crystal orientations in meteorites and artificial alloys, with implications for the study of materials science and the formation of the solar system.
