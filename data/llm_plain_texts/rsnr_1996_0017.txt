tldr: This article explores the historical portrayal of scientists in literature, from the Faust story to modern science fiction. It discusses how scientists have been depicted as amoral, arrogant, and devious, and how this image has evolved over time. The author also highlights positive portrayals of scientists in literature, such as Dr. Lydgate in George Eliot's Middlemarch and Holsten in H.G. Wells's The World Set Free. The article argues that while some literary portrayals of scientists are flawed, they provide valuable insights into the relationship between science and society.
