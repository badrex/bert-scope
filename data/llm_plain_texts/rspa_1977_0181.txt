tldr: This article presents the first measurements of lanthanide absorption spectra in the range of 300-1100 A, focusing on the 5p subshell excitations of Sm I, Eu I, Dy I, Ho I, Er I, Tm I, and Yb I. The authors analyze the relative absorption cross-sections and discuss the observed photoabsorption structure, including the spin-orbit splitting of the core and the auto-ionized Rydberg series. The study provides insights into the electronic structure and properties of lanthanide elements.
