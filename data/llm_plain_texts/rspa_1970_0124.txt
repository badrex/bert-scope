tldr: The authors investigated the kinetics of the reaction between O2(1Ag) and ozone in the temperature range of 195 to 439 K using the kinetic photoionization technique. They found the rate constant for the reaction and determined the activation energy, which is essential for understanding the reaction's role in atmospheric chemistry.
