tldr: The authors study the utilization of carbon sources by \lt;italic\gt;Bact\lt;/italic\gt;. \lt;italic\gt;lactis aerogenes\lt;/italic\gt; and the significance of the tricarboxylic acid cycle in bacterial metabolism. They found that the cycle plays a crucial role in the oxidation of pyruvic acid, the formation of amino acids necessary for protein synthesis, and the overall growth of the bacteria.
