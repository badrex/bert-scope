tldr: In 1694, a 25-year-old laborer named Samuel Chilton fell into a deep sleep that lasted for a month. Despite efforts to wake him, he remained unconscious for an extended period, only to wake up after nine weeks. Chilton slept for a total of 17 weeks, during which time he could eat and drink but did not speak. The case study by Dr. William Oliver provides insight into the medical history and unusual sleep patterns of the Tinsbury Sleeper.
