tldr: The authors study the dynamical behavior of a reduction of the forced and damped Korteweg-de Vries equation, a model for the generation of weakly nonlinear and weakly dispersive long waves in various physical contexts. They find chaotic behavior, characterized by a positive Lyapunov exponent, through period-doubling bifurcations, Melnikov sequence of subharmonic bifurcations, and homoclinic crossings. Theoretical analysis and numerical solutions are presented to support their findings.
