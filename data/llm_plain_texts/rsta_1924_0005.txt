tldr: The authors analyze the principal lunar semi-diurnal harmonic constituent of the North Sea tides, using dynamical equations to calculate elevation-gradients and currents. They explain the distribution of tides in the North Sea based on the effects of friction, depth, and the Earth's rotation. Their findings provide a better understanding of tidal patterns and help improve the accuracy of tidal predictions.
