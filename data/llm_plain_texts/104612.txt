tldr: The article discusses a case where lightning destroyed the polarity of a mariner's compass, causing it to malfunction. The author, Gowin Knight, investigates the effects of lightning on the compass and its components, discovering that the iron wires and nails within the compass and its case were magnetized by the lightning. This led to the inversion of the compass needle's polarity, rendering it useless. The author suggests improvements to the design of the compass and warns against the use of iron in compass construction.
