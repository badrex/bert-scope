tldr: This article discusses the diverse transmission processes in electric organs, focusing on the differences between the synaptic patterns and mechanisms in various species. It examines the direct and indirect excitability, cholinergic processes, and the presence of intermediate electric signs in electric organs like those of Gymnotus and Torpedo. The author concludes that while acetylcholine is likely the transmitter in Torpedo, no visible intermediate electric signs accompany the transmitter action in either organ.
