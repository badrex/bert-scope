tldr: This study investigates the reproductive development and self-fertilization in three isofemale lines of the hermaphroditic freshwater snail Physa. The researchers found that the snails' age and size at reproductive maturity varied between the lines, with male maturity reached at a mean of 5.7 weeks and female maturity at 7.3 weeks. The first production of viable offspring by self-fertilization occurred at a mean age of 22 weeks, with a significant difference in size at reproduction among the lines. The research also identified cases of outeross male-sterility, outeross female-sterility, and outeross double-sterility, suggesting that simultaneous hermaphroditism best describes the reproductive biology of these snails.
