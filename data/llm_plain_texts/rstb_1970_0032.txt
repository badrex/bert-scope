tldr: This study examines the optic lobes of insects, specifically Lepidoptera, using the Golgi method to impregnate neurons. Three classes of nerve cells are distinguished: perpendicular (class I), tangential (class II), and amacrine cells (class III). The research describes the connections and functions of these cells in the optic lobes, providing insights into the visual system of insects.
