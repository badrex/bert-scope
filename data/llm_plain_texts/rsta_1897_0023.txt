tldr: The author conducted experiments with cathode rays and vacuum tubes to study their interaction with electrified objects. They discovered that the size of the shadow cast by an object depends on its electric state. A positively electrified object causes the shadow to contract, while a negatively electrified object causes the shadow to expand. This phenomenon can be observed and manipulated by varying the resistance in the connections between the cathode and the electrode casting the shadow.
