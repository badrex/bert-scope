tldr: 'This study investigates the establishment of the intracellular symbiosis of Chlorella in green hydra. The research explores the process of ecological colonization, rather than a specific recognition mechanism, in the establishment of the symbiosis. The study also examines the factors that influence the acceptance of different Chlorella strains by green hydra, such as the presence of sporopollenin and the capacity for mesotrophic growth.'
