revised_title: Investigating Radiometer Motion and Presentation of Faces
semantic_tags:
  - Radiometer

  - Surface Roughness
  - Temperature Differences
  - Presentation of Faces
tldr: The author discusses three conditions that can cause motion in a radiometer: temperature differences between faces, more favorable presentation of one face, and surface roughness. They also mention various ways these conditions can be combined to produce motion. The Society then adjourned for the Christmas Recess.
