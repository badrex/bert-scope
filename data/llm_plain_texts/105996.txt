tldr: The author, J. S. Winn, observes a connection between the Aurora Borealis and the weather, particularly hard southerly winds and storms. He suggests that this phenomenon can help seamen predict and avoid dangerous storms by navigating accordingly. This observation could also provide insight into the nature of the Aurora Borealis itself.
