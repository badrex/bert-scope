tldr: In 1742, John Winthrop, a professor of mathematics and astronomy, observed the transit of Mercury over the Sun. He used a 24-foot telescope and recorded the event's details, including the time, position, and the planet's path. Winthrop's observations helped determine Mercury's longitude and latitude, contributing to the understanding of celestial mechanics.
