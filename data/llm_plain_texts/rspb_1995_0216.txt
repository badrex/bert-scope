revised_title: 'Discovery of Functional Iridescence and its Coevolution with Eyes in Ostracoda'

tldr: The author discovered functional iridescence in Ostracoda, a type of crustacean, and found that it coevolved with their eyes. Iridescence, caused by natural diffraction gratings, has a courtship function in some myodocopid Ostracoda. This finding challenges current theories about the evolution of the compound eye and reveals light as the main stimulus for myodocopid evolution.
