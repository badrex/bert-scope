tldr: This article investigates the mechanism of electrical breakdown in gases, focusing on the spark mechanism in air. The authors analyze previous experimental data on ionization coefficients and find that the growth of pre-breakdown currents does not follow a simple exponential law. They design a high-voltage ionization chamber to measure secondary ionization and discover that the static breakdown process in air at high values of pd is in agreement with the relations for pre-breakdown ionization currents. This challenges the widely accepted streamer theories and provides a new understanding of electrical breakdown in gases.
