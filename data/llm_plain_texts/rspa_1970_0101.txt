revised_title: Competitive Features and Degenerate Branching in Alkyne Oxidation
semantic_tags:
  - Alkyne oxidation
  - Competitive oxidation
  - Radical reactions
  - Degenerate branching
  - Chain reactions
tldr: This article investigates the competitive oxidation of acetylene, propyne, and butyne-2, comparing their rates of oxidation and the involvement of electrophilic radical species. The study explores the degenerate branching mechanism in propyne and butyne-2 slow combustions and explains why acetylene oxidizes through a straight chain. The results provide insight into the chain carriers' nature and the reactions of oxidation radicals on various intermediates.
