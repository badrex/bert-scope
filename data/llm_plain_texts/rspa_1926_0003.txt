tldr: The authors analyze the crystal structure of chrysoberyl, a mineral with a chemical composition similar to spinel. They find that chrysoberyl has an orthorhombic structure and that its oxygen atoms are nearly in a hexagonal close-packed arrangement. This contrasts with the cubic structure of spinel. The study provides insights into the relationship between the crystal structures of chrysoberyl, beryllium oxide, alumina, and spinel, and highlights the importance of hexagonal close-packing in determining the size and shape of these structures.
