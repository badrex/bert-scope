tldr: The article discusses the frequency equations of one-dimensional vibrating systems with arbitrary masses and isotopic defects. The author derives an exact expression for the frequency equation and explores the properties of isotopic mass defects in a homogeneous one-dimensional chain. A stochastic model is also considered, and expansions for the spectrum are obtained in terms of moments about the mean mass. The article concludes with a discussion of vibration band spectra in one dimension.
