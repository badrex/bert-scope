tldr: The authors synthesized corroles and related ring systems, examining their physical and chemical properties. They explored two methods for synthesizing corroles: using 5,5-bis(dipyrromethenes) and cyclizing 1,19-dideoxybiladienes-ac. The corrole ring contains an aromatic chromophore and exhibits unique properties, such as the ability to form stable aromatic anions and rapid exchange of meso-protons. The authors also discuss the synthesis of corrin, a macrocyclic compound containing angular methyl groups.
