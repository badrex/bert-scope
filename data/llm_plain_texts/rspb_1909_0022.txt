tldr: The author investigates the relationship between reflex excitation and inhibition in muscles, specifically focusing on the algebraic summation of these opposing forces. They demonstrate that both extensor and flexor muscles can exhibit this phenomenon, and that it can be manipulated by varying the intensity of the excitatory and inhibitory stimuli. This research contributes to the understanding of how the nervous system controls muscle contractions and relaxations.
