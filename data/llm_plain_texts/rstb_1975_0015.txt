tldr: This article investigates the reaction between tetrodotoxin and membrane sites at the node of Ranvier. The study focuses on the kinetics of this reaction and its dependence on pH. The authors found that tetrodotoxin reduces the sodium current by binding to receptor sites on the membrane. They also discovered that the rate of toxin action is faster at higher concentrations and that the toxin's effect is reversible. Temperature experiments showed that the Arrhenius energy of activation for the toxin-receptor reaction is 41 kJ/mol.
