tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the electrical condition of hot gold and silver surfaces during the adsorption of various gases. They found that gold surfaces acquired a negative charge when in contact with hydrogen or carbonic oxide, and a positive charge when in contact with oxygen alone. This research provides insights into the mechanism and nature of heterogeneous catalysis of gaseous reactions by hot surfaces.
