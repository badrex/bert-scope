tldr: This study examines the effect of alkalinity in the underlying solution on films of fatty acids. The researchers found that changes in packing and lateral adhesion between molecules occur as the alkalinity is varied. They also observed that films contract spontaneously on alkaline solutions, and the collapse of the films depends on the type and concentration of the alkaline solution. The findings contribute to the understanding of surface chemistry and the behavior of fatty acid films.
