tldr: The authors developed a new technique to study the moisture relations of textile fibres at high humidities. They found that textile fibres have a high sorption capacity for moisture at high humidities, and the immediate saturation regain is close to the moisture imbibition obtained from standard centrifuging. The previous methods of measurement yielded low values of saturation regain due to unfavorable conditions for mass transfer and inadequate temperature control. The hysteresis loop is concluded to close at saturation.
