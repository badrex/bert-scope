tldr: 'The author proposes observing the star Sirius to determine its annual parallax, which would provide direct proof of the Copernican system. The author examines previous observations of Sirius and finds a noticeable difference in its zenith distances at different times of the year, suggesting the presence of a parallax. This proposal encourages further observations to confirm the existence of a parallax in Sirius.'
