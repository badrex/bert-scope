revised_title: Ion Implantation and Hyperfine Interactions in Solids
semantic_tags:
  - Ion implantation
  - Radiation damage
  - Defect clusters
  - Irradiation enhanced diffusion
  - Precipitation effects
tldr: This article discusses the physical state of ion-implanted solids, focusing on the destruction of the crystalline lattice during ion implantation, post-irradiation annealing, and the formation of defect clusters. The author also explores irradiation-enhanced diffusion and precipitation effects in ion-implanted materials, highlighting the importance of understanding these processes for the controlled introduction of impurities into solids.
