tldr: This article discusses the time-relations of capillary electrometer excursions and presents a method for investigating electrical changes of short duration. The author explores the factors affecting the rate of movement in the capillary electrometer and develops a new method for analyzing the data. The study demonstrates the electrometer's ability to detect and differentiate between sudden and gradual changes in electrical potential.
