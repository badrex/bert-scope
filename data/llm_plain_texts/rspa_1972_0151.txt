tldr: The authors develop a non-local space theory to study the propagation of plasmons in periodic lattices, focusing on long wavelengths. They derive an equation of motion for density fluctuations and apply the random phase approximation to obtain the dispersion relation for a uniform electron gas in the high density limit. The connection with Bloch's hydrodynamic model of collective oscillations is also discussed.
