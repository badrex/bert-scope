tldr: The authors studied the magnetic effects of iron-plated ships on compasses and developed methods to correct compass deviations caused by the ship's iron. They discovered that the mean directive force on a compass needle is diminished in iron-built ships, leading to errors in navigation. They also found that the heeling error, caused by the ship's angle, can be corrected using mathematical formulas and observations of vertical force.
