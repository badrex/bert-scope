tldr: 'The study investigates the freezing points of egg yolk and white and the conditions required for ice formation within them. The researchers found that the freezing point of yolk is around -0.57°C, while the white's freezing point is -0.42°C. They also discovered that ice formation in the yolk is hindered by the vitelline membrane, and ice can only penetrate it at specific temperatures. The study highlights the importance of understanding the state of water in living cells and the need for further research on osmotic pressures in eggs.'
