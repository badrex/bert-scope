tldr: This study investigates the transfer of heat by radiation in vacuum vessels at low temperatures. The authors determined the emissivities of various metals, including copper, silver, gold, tin, brass, aluminum, steel, and graphite. They found that a freshly reduced smooth copper surface was more efficient in reducing heat transfer than a highly polished surface. This research provides valuable information for designing vacuum-jacketed vessels for transporting liquefied gases.
