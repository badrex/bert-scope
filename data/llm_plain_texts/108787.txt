tldr: The author explores the mathematical properties of pedal surfaces, which are the loci of feet of perpendiculars drawn from a point in space to the tangent planes of a given primitive surface. The article establishes relationships between the volumes of pedal surfaces and their origins, and demonstrates that the origins of pedals of equal volume always lie on a surface of the third order. The author also compares the properties of pedal curves and pedal surfaces, and provides examples to illustrate the concepts.
