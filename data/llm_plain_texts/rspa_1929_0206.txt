tldr: This study investigates the degree of dissociation of various acids in methyl and ethyl alcohol, comparing their electrolytic behavior in water and alcoholic solutions. The authors find that strong acids like hydrochloric acid dissociate more in alcoholic solutions, while weak acids like salicylic acid have a lower degree of dissociation in alcohol compared to water. The study highlights the importance of the solvent's affinity for the proton in determining the degree of acid dissociation.
