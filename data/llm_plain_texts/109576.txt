tldr: The author, Anthony Carlisle, studied the arrangement of arteries in slow-moving animals and found that they have a different distribution pattern compared to ordinary muscles. He observed that the coronary arteries, which supply the heart, are more subdivided than other sets of arteries. This suggests that impediments to blood flow in muscles lead to a decrease in their action. Carlisle provides examples of this phenomenon in various animals, including the human eye, the swimming bladder of fish, and the intestinum ileum of the Cavia Aguti.
