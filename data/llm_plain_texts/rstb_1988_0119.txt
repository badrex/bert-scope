tldr: The authors used molecular techniques and in situ mapping to study the Sxr region of the mouse Y chromosome, which controls primary sex determination. They discovered that the H-Y variant of Sxr arose from a partial deletion within the Sxr region, proposing a new model for the generation of the original Sxr region. This research has implications for understanding sex determination and the potential role of H-Y expression in spermatogenesis.
