tldr: This article investigates the presence of transferrin and transferrin receptors on the trophoblast of human placentae. The authors demonstrate that transferrin binds to specific receptors on trophoblastic cells, suggesting that binding of maternal transferrin to trophoblast receptors is involved in the process of iron transport to the fetus. They also propose several possible biological roles of these receptors, including limiting iron in intervillous spaces and preventing maternal immunosurveillance.
