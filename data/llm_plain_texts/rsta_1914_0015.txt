tldr: The authors determined the electromotive force of the Weston normal cell using a Weber electrodynamometer. They found a value of 1.018 semi-absolute volts, which is important for comparing different methods and instruments for the absolute determination of the ampere. The study aimed to improve the accuracy and precision of these measurements, contributing to the development of more reliable methods in the field of electromagnetism.
