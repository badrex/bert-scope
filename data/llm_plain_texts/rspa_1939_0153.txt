tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the beta-radiations of uranium X and the transmutation of the carbon isotope 13C by deuterons. They used a cloud chamber to investigate the beta-rays and found that the energy spectra of uranium X were complex. The authors also detected a new transmutation of 13C by deuterons, which could be useful in understanding the relationship between disintegration energies and decay rates.
