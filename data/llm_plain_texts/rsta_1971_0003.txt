tldr: The authors studied ultrabasic rocks from the ocean floor, specifically from the rift zones of the Mid-Indian Ocean Ridge. They found that these rocks are slightly differentiated pyrolites of the oceanic type and have similar petrographic characteristics to peridotites of the alpine type. The authors also discussed the geological and petrochemical differences between oceanic and alpine ultrabasic rocks, suggesting that they were formed by different processes.
