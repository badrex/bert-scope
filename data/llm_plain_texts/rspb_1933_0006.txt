revised_title: 'Comparative Study of Iris Physiology in Selachians'
semantic_tags:
  - Iris physiology
  - Selachians
  - Pupil movement
  - Smooth muscle pharmacology
  - Bio-photochemical reactions
tldr: This study examines the iris physiology of Selachians, focusing on the direct effect of light on the sphincter muscle without the mediation of a nervous mechanism. The research explores the mechanisms present in different fish species, their phylogenetic relationships, and their implications for general smooth muscle physiology and bio-photochemical reactions.
