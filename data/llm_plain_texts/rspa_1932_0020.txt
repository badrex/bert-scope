tldr: Chadwick and Constable conducted experiments using α-particles to study the artificial disintegration of fluorine and aluminium. They discovered that the protons emitted from these elements consist of distinct groups, and the disintegration can be explained by the resonance effect between the α-particles and the atomic nucleus. The researchers used improved experimental techniques to resolve the proton groups emitted by fluorine and aluminium, providing evidence for the existence of resonance levels in their nuclei.
