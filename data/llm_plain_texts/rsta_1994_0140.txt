tldr: The author presents a generalization of the Boltzmann equation that accounts for the alteration of the distribution function on scales of the collision time order. This generalization leads to new hydrodynamic equations and a strict theory of turbulence on Kolmogorov's scale. Applications include calculating forced sound-wave speed, damping of sound, and shock wave structure for arbitrary Mach numbers.
