tldr: The article presents a reaction model for the epitaxial growth of III-V semiconductors using chemical beam epitaxy. The model considers physical effects like site-blocking, lateral interactions, and the role of adsorbed arsenic in inhibiting growth. Computer simulations based on the model show good agreement with experimental observations and provide a better understanding of the growth kinetics of GaAs. This research contributes to the development of advanced semiconductor materials and technologies.
