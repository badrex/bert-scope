tldr: Edward Sabine's study of the diurnal variation of the magnetic needle at St. Helena found that the variations still occur at intermediate stations between the northern and southern magnetic hemispheres. The variations specific to each hemisphere prevail at opposite seasons of the year, possibly related to the sun's position relative to the Earth's equator.
