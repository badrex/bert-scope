tldr: The article presents a family of stationary, cylindrically symmetric solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell equations for charged dust distributions in rigid rotation. The interesting feature of these solutions is that the Lorentz force vanishes everywhere, and the ratio of charge density to mass density can take any value. The solutions do not have a classical analogue and can be divided into two types: one with a physical singularity and another with a radially open space.
