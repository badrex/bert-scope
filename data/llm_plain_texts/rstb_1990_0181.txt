tldr: The article discusses the importance of quantifying land resources and their potential agricultural productivity for sustainable development planning. The authors describe the Agro-Ecological Zone (AEZ) methodology, which combines soil, landform, and climate data to assess production potential and provide a basis for land use decisions. The authors emphasize the need for developing countries to address ecological limitations and manage their natural resources effectively to support growing populations and increasing demand for food and agricultural products.
