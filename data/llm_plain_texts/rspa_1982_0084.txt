tldr: The authors examine the principle of equivalence in a quantum context, exploring the relationship between quantum field theory and gravity. They argue that a consistent theory of gravity coupled to matter, based on an action principle, is only possible if the gravitational coupling is universal. The authors demonstrate this through a set of consistency conditions connecting successive orders of the gravitational perturbation expansion.
