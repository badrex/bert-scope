tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate the lower regions of the radium E -ray spectrum. They used a specially designed magnetic spectrograph and Geiger-Muller tube counters to accurately observe the undistorted spectrum, especially below 100. The results provide a practical realization of this ideal, down to the region of 20 at least, without the need for corrections.
