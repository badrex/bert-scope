tldr: This article discusses the chemical nature and properties of aluminium soaps, focusing on their reactions with fatty acids and the formation of di-soaps and mono-soaps. The authors explore the role of water in these reactions and propose a polymeric formula for aluminium soaps based on sixfold coordination aluminium-oxygen octahedra. They also investigate the physical nature of aluminium soaps in organic solvents and their similarities to natural and synthetic polymers.
