tldr: This study analyzed the chemical and mineralogical content of plants in the Lake Huleh Preserve, Israel, to understand the impact of plant communities on the lake's chemical composition. The research found significant differences in elemental uptake between annual and perennial plants, as well as between aquatic and terrestrial plants. The findings also revealed correlations between elemental composition and plant taxonomy, suggesting that certain elements may serve as defense mechanisms or play a role in leaf shape and structure.
