tldr: The authors conducted a spectroscopic study on dideuteroacetylene, examining nine vibrational absorption bands with high resolving power. They determined the rotational constants for the vibrational levels and derived values for the -doubling coefficient in some levels. The results emphasize the importance of high-resolution spectroscopy for accurate analysis and understanding of molecular properties.
