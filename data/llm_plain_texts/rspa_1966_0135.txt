tldr: The authors derived an expansion for the Thomas-Fermi-Dirac function at high densities, which is essential for understanding the behavior of atoms in solids. They also derived corresponding expansions for pressure and energy, comparing it with the GeU-Mann-Brueckner series for the correlation energy of a free electron gas. This work provides a mathematical basis for the high-density expansion and allows for the derivation of an explicit expansion for the energy in the T.F.D. model.
