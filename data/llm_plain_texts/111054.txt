tldr: Professor Graham's study on the diffusion of liquids explores how different substances diffuse into water and how this can be used for separation and analysis. The research shows that common salt, sugar, and urea diffuse away from albumen, while albumen has a low diffusibility. The findings also reveal that isomorphous compounds have equal diffusibility, and that chemical decompositions can be produced by liquid diffusion. This research provides a new method of separation or analysis for many soluble bodies, similar to the process of distillation.
