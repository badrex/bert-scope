tldr: This article discusses the relationship between the Earth's climate and the variability of the Sun over recent millennia. It explores the challenges of detecting periodic or quasi-periodic variations in the solar constant through climatic and meteorological data. The article also highlights the importance of studying solar interaction with the climate to better understand the mechanisms behind solar activity and its effects on Earth.
