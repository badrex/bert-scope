tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effect of groove geometry on the strength of steel under tension. They found that U-grooved steel specimens were stronger than plain specimens, despite the non-uniform stress distribution. The author also discussed the reasons for this phenomenon, such as the uneven stress distribution, bending stresses, and the crystalline nature of the steel at fracture.
