tldr: The author presents a unique case of a hermaphrodite lobster, where the right side is female and the left side is male. The lobster has both male and female reproductive organs, which are distinct and separate from each other. This discovery sheds light on the possibility of hermaphroditism in species with double and independent reproductive systems, such as lobsters, crabs, and some birds.
