tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the absolute value of the British Association unit of resistance and the pitch of a standard tuning-fork. They used different methods, including Lorentz's method, and found close agreement in their results. The authors also discussed the determination of the absolute pitch of a tuning-fork used as a time standard in their work.
