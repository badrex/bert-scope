tldr: "The authors conducted experiments to determine the freezing point of rhodium using the International Temperature Scale. They employed a method that involved heating a rhodium ingot with electric induction and using an optical pyrometer with a calibrated absorption device. The results showed a very good agreement between the melting and freezing points, indicating the exceptional purity of the rhodium used."
