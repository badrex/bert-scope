semantic_tags:
  - Astronomy
  - Atmospheric Refraction
  - Temperature Gradient
  - Laplace's Solution
  - Biot's Dissertation
tldr: James Ivory's letter to P. M. Roget discusses the need to investigate the law of temperature diminishing with height. He critiques Laplace's solution and Biot's dissertation on the influence of aqueous vapor on refractions, referring to his accompanying paper for further details.
