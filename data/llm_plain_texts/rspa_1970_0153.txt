tldr: This article presents a detailed theoretical treatment of the hyper Raman effect using the density matrix technique. The authors derive general formulae that provide information on the scattered radiation, scattering mechanisms, and resonance processes. They also develop a hyperpolarizability theory analogous to Placzek's polarizability theory and establish the conditions under which it is valid. The hyper Raman effect offers a method for investigating previously inaccessible molecular frequencies, making it of great interest to molecular spectroscopists.
