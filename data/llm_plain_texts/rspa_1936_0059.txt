tldr: The authors conducted a study on helium ratios in rocks and minerals from the diamond pipes of South Africa to determine their age and origin. They found that the eclogite and peridotite inclusions may have formed from the parent magma of kimberlite or be pre-existing crustal rocks. The low helium ratios in some inclusions make it difficult to determine their age without additional geological evidence.
