tldr: The Rayleigh model is a one-dimensional system that studies the spatial and velocity relaxation of an ensemble of test particles in a heat-bath. This model, originally formulated by Lord Rayleigh, is an idealized representation of particle transport in a moderator. The study focuses on the singular nature of the eigenvalue problems arising from the model, which leads to the problematics of distribution theory and continuous spectra.
