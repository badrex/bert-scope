tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments on an alloy of sodium and potassium to study the complete photo-electric emission. They found that the same law governs the variation of the complete photo-electric emission with the temperature of the source of radiation, confirming previous theories. The findings contribute to the understanding of photoelectric and thermionic emissions from materials.'
