tldr: The authors extend the resonance valence state theory to include partial ionic bonding in molecules. They analyze the valence states of charged and neutral atoms and discuss the molecular wavefunctions for ionic structures. The study applies the theory to examples from first- and second-row elements, comparing the energies of representative examples and the symmetries of atomic terms appearing in valence states. This research helps in understanding the relative weighting of covalent and ionic structures in molecular wavefunctions.
