tldr: 'Charles Daubeny's study investigates the effects of light on various plant functions, including oxygen production, leaf color change, moisture exhalation, and water absorption. He found that the most luminous rays have the greatest impact on these processes. The study also examines the role of plants in purifying the atmosphere and the relationship between carbonic acid absorption and oxygen evolution.'
