tldr: The author, John Strange, describes two groups of prismatic basaltine columns in the Venetian State in Italy. He compares the columns' forms, sizes, and textures, and discusses their geological context. The columns are found in Monte Rosso and San Giovanni Illarione, and their unique characteristics provide insight into the formation of granites. The author also notes the variety of positions the columns can have, which challenges the idea that a perpendicular position is a characteristic of basaltine crystallizations.
