tldr: This article presents a study on the nonlinear elastic behavior of flexible composites under finite deformation. The constitutive relations are derived based on a strain-energy density function, which is assumed to be a fourth-order polynomial form referring to the initial principal material coordinates. The constitutive equations are verified through experiments on off-axis tension, simple shear for unidirectional composites, and uniaxial tension for flexible composites with wavy fibers, showing good agreement between theory and experiments.
