tldr: The authors studied the cell wall structure and development in Cladophora, Ghaetomorpha, and Spongomorpha species of algae from the Cladophoraceae family. They used X-ray diffraction analysis and electron microscopy to examine the wall structures and found that Cladophora and Chaetomorpha have walls containing microfibrils of cellulose I, while Spongomorpha has a substance resembling cellulose II. The study provides insights into the growth and development of these algae and their cell wall structures.
