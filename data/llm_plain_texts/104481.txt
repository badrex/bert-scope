tldr: A 12-year-old boy from Black Barnsley in Yorkshire suffers from an extraordinary craving for food, consuming large quantities of food daily. Despite eating massive amounts, he cannot retain any nutrients as everything is thrown up. This unusual condition began a year ago and has left the boy constantly hungry, leading him to gnaw at his own flesh when not fed. The case study aims to document this rare condition and its impact on the child's life.
