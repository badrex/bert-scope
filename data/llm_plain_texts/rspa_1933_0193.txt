tldr: The authors analyze the stability of a viscous fluid flow between parallel walls for three-dimensional disturbances. They derive a fourth-order differential equation and demonstrate that if a velocity profile is unstable for a specific Reynolds number, it will also be unstable for two-dimensional disturbances with a smaller Reynolds number. Additionally, they show that all profiles are stable for a certain degenerate type of disturbance.
