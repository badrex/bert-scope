tldr: In a letter to James Jurin, G. Cramer describes an Aurora Borealis event accompanied by unusual appearances. The Aurora was relatively calm, but a red, meridional zone similar to a rainbow was observed. This zone seemed to affect the visibility of nearby stars and Jupiter. Cramer speculates on the possible causes of this phenomenon, but ultimately concludes that it is difficult to explain. Additionally, he shares an interesting observation of ash trees growing in a yard where pipes had been removed.
