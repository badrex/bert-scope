tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the release of neurophysin and vasopressin from neurosecretory vesicles in the nerve endings of the mammalian neurohypophysis. They found that both vasopressin and neurophysin are released in parallel by a K+-stimulated, Ca2+-dependent mechanism, supporting the view that neurosecretion from the posterior pituitary involves exocytosis.
