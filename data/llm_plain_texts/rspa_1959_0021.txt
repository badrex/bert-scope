tldr: The authors studied the photochemical decomposition of methyl iodide in the presence of nitric oxide and found that a reaction occurs between nitrosomethane and nitric oxide, forming an unidentified product Y. The reaction's rate and extent depend on the concentration of nitric oxide. The absorption spectrum of product Y extends from 2300 to 5300 A, and it appears stable in the gas phase.
