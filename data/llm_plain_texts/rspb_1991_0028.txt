tldr: The authors conducted a longitudinal study of a progressive anomia in a patient with dementia of Alzheimer's type. The anomia could not be attributed to a semantic deficit but appeared to arise from impaired access to phonological word forms. This study provided insights into the characteristics of progressive anomia and the dynamics of interacting processes as the level of performance declined.
