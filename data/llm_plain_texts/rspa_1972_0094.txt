tldr: This study investigates the formation and properties of rigid surface films at the interface between metals and liquids. The researchers developed a mechanical squeeze film apparatus to measure the thickness of the lubricant film and observed its behavior under various conditions. They discovered that the film thickness is influenced by temperature and that the films are organized by chemical forces rather than physical forces. The findings provide insights into boundary lubrication and related phenomena.
