tldr: The article presents a solution to a mixed boundary value problem in the theory of diffraction, specifically for a semi-infinite half plane with a soft boundary condition on one side and a rigid boundary condition on the other. This mathematical model represents a noise barrier with an absorbing lining and helps in understanding the attenuation of sound in the shadow region of the barrier.
