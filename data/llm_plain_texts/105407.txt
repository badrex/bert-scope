tldr: A young boy suffered a complicated fracture in his arm that did not heal with traditional methods. A surgeon proposed a new operation to fix the issue by making a longitudinal incision, cutting off the ends of the broken bone, and rejoining them. The operation was successful, and the boy eventually recovered, with his arm fully healed and functional.
