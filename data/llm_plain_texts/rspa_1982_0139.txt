tldr: The authors develop an averaged Reynolds equation using the two-space homogenization method to study hydrodynamic lubrication of rough surfaces. They apply this equation to a squeeze-film bearing with sinusoidal or isotropic surface roughness, finding that the load-carrying capacity can be enhanced or reduced depending on the orientation of the surface roughness relative to the flow.
