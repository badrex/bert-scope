tldr: The authors conducted a series of soundings and temperature observations in the Faeroe Channel to explore the existence of a submarine ridge. They discovered a significant temperature difference between the areas on either side of the ridge and confirmed its existence. The Faeroe Channel's Wyville Thomson ridge, stretching 100 miles in length and 10 miles in width, has depths of 250 to 280 fathoms and consists of stones and gravel. The authors suggest that more submerged chains of submarine elevations will be discovered as oceanic soundings become more numerous.
