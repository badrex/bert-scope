tldr: The author argues that the problem with automation is not over-automation, but rather inadequate feedback and interaction with human operators. They propose that appropriate design should provide continual feedback, interact effectively with operators, and account for worst-case scenarios. The author suggests that automation systems should either be made less intelligent or more so, but the current level is insufficient, leading to difficulties in handling abnormalities and providing necessary information to the crew.
