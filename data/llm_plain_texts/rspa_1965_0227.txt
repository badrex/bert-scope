tldr: This article discusses the chemistry of corrinoids, focusing on the physical and chemical properties of corphyrins. The authors investigate the interaction between the conjugated ring, cobalt ion, and axial ligands using various techniques, including absorption and reflection spectroscopy, circular dichroism, proton magnetic resonance, electron spin resonance, and controlled potential reduction. The study provides insights into the valency, structure, and equilibria of cobalamins and cobinamides, contributing to a better understanding of their properties and potential applications.
