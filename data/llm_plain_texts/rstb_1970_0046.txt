tldr: This article discusses the phenomenon of natural sex reversal in vertebrates, focusing on functional hermaphroditism in teleost fish. It explores different types of hermaphroditism, such as synchronous, protandrous, and protogynous, and their gonadal development patterns. The article highlights the complexity of sexuality in sex-reversing hermaphrodites and the importance of considering ontogenetic patterns in studies on sexuality and sex determination.
