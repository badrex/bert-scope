tldr: The authors studied the distribution of 5-rays along the tracks of singly-charged particles in photographic emulsions to distinguish between protons, deuterons, and tritons. They found that the 5-ray density can help identify the type of particle and improve the accuracy of calibration and analysis in nuclear plate investigations.
