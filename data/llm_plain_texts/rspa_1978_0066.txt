tldr: This study investigates the creep rupture of circumferentially notched tension bars and the effects of stress redistribution and multi-axial stress rupture criterion on their structural behavior. The research focuses on two types of notches: circular and British Standard notches, and explores the differences in their stationary-state stress fields. The findings can be applied to various high-temperature structures, such as tension fastenings, turbine blades, and turbine casing studs.
