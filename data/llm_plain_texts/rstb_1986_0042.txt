tldr: The article discusses the evolution and function of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (Rubisco) in photosynthetic organisms. It explores the interaction and functional relations of large and small subunits in Rubisco from Prokaryota and Eukaryota. The authors also examine the potential for genetic modification to improve Rubisco's efficiency and discuss the enzyme's role in photosynthesis and photorespiration.
