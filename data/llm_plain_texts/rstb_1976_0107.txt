tldr: The authors studied the in vitro reconstitution of the CAM strain of Tobacco Rattle Virus (TRV) and investigated the RNA-protein interactions involved in its assembly. They found that the 36S protein disk easily binds to the RNA, and the polarity and specificity of encapsidation of TRV RNA by homologous and heterologous viral protein are discussed. The reconstitution process and the role of pH and ionic strength in the assembly of TRV are also examined.
