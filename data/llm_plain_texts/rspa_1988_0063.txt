tldr: The authors developed an experimental-computational procedure to determine material constitutive parameters for ductile materials, using tensile specimen size and geometry effects. They demonstrated that a single uniaxial continuum true-stress-true-strain curve can predict the behavior of laboratory specimens with different geometries, ensuring the uniqueness of the parameters. This approach allows for accurate characterization of material behavior over a wide range of deformations, from zero to final fracture.
