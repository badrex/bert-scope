tldr: This study examines the normal and pathological histology and bacteriology of oysters, focusing on the factors causing greenness in oysters and the presence of bacteria like the typhoid bacillus. The authors conclude that different types of greenness in oysters are caused by varying amounts of copper and iron, and that sea water is inimical to the growth of the typhoid bacillus. They also discuss the presence of other bacteria, such as the colon group and B. enteritidis sporogenes, in oysters.
