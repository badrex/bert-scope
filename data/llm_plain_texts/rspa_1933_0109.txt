tldr: This study investigates the thermal and electrical conductivities of tungsten, molybdenum, silver, and iron between -183°C and 100°C using an electrical method. The purity of the metal specimens and their sensitivity to impurities are also discussed. The results provide a comprehensive understanding of the conductivities of these metals under various temperatures and conditions.
