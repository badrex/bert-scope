tldr: The article explores the use of laser-generated ultrasound for non-destructive examination and validation of surface-breaking defects in metals. The technique involves the interaction of laser-generated Rayleigh pulses with surface-breaking slots, providing a diagnostic method for measuring defect depths. The authors present experimental results and discuss the potential of this method for detecting and characterizing surface defects in metals.
