semantic_tags:
  - Hamiltonian systems
  - Chaotic motion
  - Variational principles
  - Cantori
  - Modular smoothing
tldr: This article discusses recent developments in classical mechanics, specifically in the study of intramolecular motion and chemical reactions. It highlights the transition between regular and chaotic motion in Hamiltonian systems and introduces variational principles, cantori, and modular smoothing as methods for understanding these complex systems.
