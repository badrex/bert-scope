tldr: The authors studied the retinotectal projection in frogs during the regeneration of the optic nerve. They mapped the projection of the retina to the optic tectum in 67 experiments at different stages after cutting the optic nerve. The results showed various patterns of projection, with some frogs recovering the normal retinotectal projection, while others had partial or complete recovery along with an anomalous projection to the wrong half of the brain. This study provides insights into the mechanisms of optic nerve regeneration and the recovery of vision in amphibians.
