tldr: This study investigates the effects of drug inhibition on memory formation in chickens. The researchers found that sodium pump inhibitors and protein synthesis inhibitors both cause memory decline, but with different effects on short-term and long-term memory. The results suggest that short-term memory is independent of protein synthesis and that long-term memory requires protein synthesis for storage. The findings could have implications for understanding memory processes in the brain and potential applications in treating memory-related disorders.
