tldr: A large bony substance was found in the womb of a 57-year-old woman. The woman had a history of shortness of breath, difficulty in urination and bowel movements, and a constant feeling of weight in the pelvic area. The woman eventually died from asthma, and the bony substance was found to be strictly united to the womb. The discovery of this unusual case sheds light on the relationship between the bony substance and the woman's health issues.
