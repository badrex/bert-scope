tldr: The article presents an electro-osmotic theory of fluid transfer in epithelia, where the volume flow is almost entirely due to electro-osmotic coupling in the boundary membranes. The model predicts that intracellular and lateral spaces play an important role in the overall flow process and can explain isotonic fluid transport in epithelial systems. The behavior of an extracellular shunt is also studied, showing that both water and salt flow rates depend on its magnitude and ion specificity.
