tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the isotope effect in crystals to investigate the nature of hydrogen bonds. They found that special resonance effects may be present in at least one example, oxalic acid dihydrate, and discussed smaller effects in other crystals. Their research provides insights into the behavior of hydrogen bonds in crystals and the forces responsible for them.
