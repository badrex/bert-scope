tldr: The authors propose a general structure factor formalism for interpreting accurate X-ray and neutron diffraction data, which incorporates complex atomic scattering factors and complex temperature factors. This new formalism accounts for antisymmetric features associated with nonspherical atomic charge distributions and anharmonic components of atomic vibration amplitudes, improving the accuracy of crystal and molecular structure analysis.
