tldr: The authors present a method to study stationary gravitational fields due to single bodies using a mathematical approach. They introduce the concept of a continuous stationary universe and discuss the critical condition for this universe. The authors also explain the process of mathematical induction to create models of these gravitational fields and discuss the residual energy tensor.
