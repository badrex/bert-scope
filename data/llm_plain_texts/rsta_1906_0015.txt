tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the combination of hydrogen and oxygen in contact with hot surfaces, focusing on the catalytic influence of the heated surface on the reaction rates. They found that the reaction was not governed by the law of mass action and that other factors, such as diffusion and surface properties, played a significant role in the reaction's velocity.
