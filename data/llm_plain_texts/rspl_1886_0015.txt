tldr: The author discusses the source of terrestrial magnetism and concludes that the increase of magnetic force observed in certain islands comes from portions of those islands raised from the magnetized part of the earth. The paper also describes the remains of the extinct land-lizard, Megalania prisca, from Queensland, Australia, providing insights into its sacrum and foot-bones.
