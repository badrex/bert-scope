tldr: "The article is a biographical memoir of Leonard Frank Spath, a notable paleontologist who specialized in the study of ammonites. Spath made significant contributions to the understanding of ammonite evolution and their use in correlating and dating sedimentary formations. He worked on ammonites from the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous systems and was a leading authority on their classification and zonal subdivision. His extensive research and monographs on ammonites and Mesozoic invertebrate faunas from various locations have greatly advanced the field of paleontology."
