tldr: The authors investigated the denaturation of proteins in muscle juice when frozen and thawed. They found that freezing at low temperatures led to protein denaturation, with the extent and rate of denaturation depending on the storage temperature. The study also showed that rapid freezing followed by rapid thawing did not cause significant denaturation. The findings provide insights into the effects of freezing on proteins and have implications for the food industry and scientific research.
