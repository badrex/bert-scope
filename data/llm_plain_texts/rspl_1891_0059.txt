tldr: In this article, William Huggins and his wife report their observations of Nova Auriga, a celestial phenomenon with unique spectral characteristics. They discovered that the star's spectrum showed a large motion of recession for the bright lines and a motion of approach for the hydrogen absorption lines. The authors also found that some lines were doubled, with dark lines on the blue side. They discuss the implications of these findings and reserve further analysis for a future publication.
