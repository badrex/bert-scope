tldr: This study investigates the ionization of atomic hydrogen by protons in the energy range of 60 to 400 keV using the "crossed beam" technique. The researchers determined the ratio of the cross-section for ionization of atomic hydrogen to that for molecular hydrogen and found that the absolute cross-section for ionization of atomic hydrogen is in good agreement with the Born approximation calculations. The results also show that the common assumption of a hydrogen molecule being equivalent to two hydrogen atoms is not accurate at lower energy levels.
