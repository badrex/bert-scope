tldr: The article explores periodic distributions of dislocations in three-dimensional space and time, deriving expressions for the stress fields and equilibrium conditions. The authors apply these findings to a Frank network of dislocations, demonstrating the stress field induced by the network and its effects on the surrounding material.
