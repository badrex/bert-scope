tldr: The authors developed a method to measure the pressure in explosion waves using metal foils of varying thicknesses. They tested different gaseous mixtures and found that the breaking power of the mixtures varied, with electrolytic gas having the highest breaking power. The results provided insights into the pressures developed in explosion waves and the strengths of various gaseous mixtures.
