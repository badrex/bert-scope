tldr: The authors apply microstructural fracture mechanics to various metal surface states, focusing on the interaction between the environment and the metal surface under applied stress. They discuss the development of surface defects, such as pitting and crack growth, and the influence of environmental factors on fatigue lifetime. The study highlights the importance of understanding and predicting corrosion fatigue behavior for engineering applications.
