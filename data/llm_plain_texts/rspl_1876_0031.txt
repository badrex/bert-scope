tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine Verdet's constant in absolute units, which is essential for understanding the interaction between light and magnetic fields. They used a modified method by comparing the actions of a small coil and a large electro-dynamometer of the British Association. The results showed that the equation of units is related to the strength of the current helix and the deflection of a suspension outside.
