tldr: The author discusses the concept of self-tolerance, which is crucial for preventing autoimmunity. They explain that the immune system learns to recognize self-antigens and tolerate them, and that different mechanisms of tolerance induction operate for self-reactive T and B lymphocytes. The author also highlights the importance of understanding the cellular mechanisms and antigen-related variables in self-tolerance, and the use of transgenic mice in studying these processes.
