tldr: The author investigates the communication of vibration and sound in gases, specifically focusing on the rapid propagation of sound in hydrogen gas. They explain that the high velocity of sound propagation in hydrogen can account for the feebleness of sound in hydrogen and the effect of the admixture of hydrogen with air. The author provides a detailed explanation of the phenomenon and supports their findings with numerical calculations.
