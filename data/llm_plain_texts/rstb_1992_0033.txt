tldr: This study examines the survival of insect fruit predators, specifically Nanophyes shoreae, during sporadic fruiting events in Southeast Asian Dipterocarpaceae trees. The research found that the primary factors affecting the survival of these predators were fruit abscission and vertebrate predation. The low recruitment of insect predators during sporadic fruiting suggests that mass flowering plays a crucial role in their survival and may be driven by other evolutionary forces.
