tldr: The author presents a new method for constructing the honey bee's hexagonal cell using geometrical principles. The method involves inscribing an equilateral triangle in a hexagon and bisecting its sides. By drawing parallel lines and folding the resulting trapeziums, a hexagonal prism is formed that accommodates three lozenges, replicating the structure of a honey bee's cell.
