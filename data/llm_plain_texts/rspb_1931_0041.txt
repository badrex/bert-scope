tldr: The author's experiments on pea and vetch plants reveal that the growth of a plant's shoots is influenced by the presence of other growing shoots. When one shoot is defoliated, it is inhibited by the other, suggesting that unexpanded, rapidly developing leaves play a crucial role in this process. This phenomenon sheds light on the complex interactions between plant growth and inhibition, and the balance between competing shoots.
