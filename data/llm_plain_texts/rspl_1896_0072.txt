tldr: The author studied the oviposition and egg characteristics of Nautilus macromphalus, a species found in the New Caledonian Archipelago. They discovered that the eggs are laid individually and are firmly attached to a suitable surface. The eggs have a double casing, with an inner capsule and an outer capsule, and are of remarkable size. The author also observed differences in the breeding patterns of Nautilus compared to other similar forms, suggesting a definite law of periodicity in their reproduction.
