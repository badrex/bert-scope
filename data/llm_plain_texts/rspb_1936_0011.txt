tldr: Researchers Colin G. Butler and Jean M. Innes studied the metabolic activity of Locusta migratoria in both solitary and migratory phases. They found that migratory locusts have a higher metabolic rate than solitary locusts in all instars. This discovery sheds light on the differences in behavior, coloration, and morphological structure between the two phases of locusts.
