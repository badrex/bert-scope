semantic_tags:
  - Solar energy
  - Heterojunction solar cells
  - Surface passivation
  - Monolithic multijunction cells
  - Low-temperature fabrication
tldr: This article discusses the development and potential of heterojunction solar cells, which are composed of two different materials, two semiconductors, a semiconductor and a metal, or a semiconductor and an electrolyte. The article explores the benefits of heterojunctions in surface passivation, monolithic multijunction devices, devices with semiconductors of only one conductivity type, and low-temperature fabrication techniques. It also highlights the importance of lattice match and interface structure for efficient solar cell performance.
