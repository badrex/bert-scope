tldr: The author discusses the recent change in solar research due to the hypothesis of possible dissociation of elementary bodies at solar temperatures. They compare the old and new hypotheses and explain how observations during total solar eclipses can help determine which hypothesis fits the facts better. The author also presents predictions for the Egyptian eclipse and verifies them with observations made during the event.
