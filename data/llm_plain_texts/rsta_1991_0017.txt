tldr: This article reviews existing simple prescriptions for evaluating hull geometries in relation to propeller-induced surface force excitation. It discusses categories of excitation and relevant propeller-hull-wake parameters, and evaluates available elementary criteria and estimation formulas for making preliminary judgments on the acceptability of a given arrangement. The article also offers critiques of these criteria and their applicability to example ships, and their usefulness in implementing early-stage design for vibration avoidance.
