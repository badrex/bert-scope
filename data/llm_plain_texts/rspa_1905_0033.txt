tldr: 'Sir James Dewar describes his experiments with a thermo-electric junction to determine the lowest temperatures. He used a German-silver platinum couple to measure temperatures near the boiling point of hydrogen and found that the junctions could accurately measure temperatures as low as absolute zero. This research provided useful information for temperature measurement at extremely low temperatures and confirmed previous investigations on the subject.'
