tldr: The authors conducted a series of experiments to investigate the electrification of air and other gases. They discovered that air and gases become electrified when bubbled through water or solutions of various salts, acids, and alkalis. The electrification of air was found to be negative when tested using a water-dropper. The authors also studied the change in absorption produced by fluorescence and the effects of electrification on atmospheric electricity.
