tldr: The authors developed a method to investigate the photon component of cosmic radiation and studied its energy distribution and absorption. They observed the transition curve for the number of anti-coincidences and compared it with the theoretical curve, confirming the validity of the absorption formula for high-energy photons. The results provide insights into the total intensity of photons in cosmic radiation.
