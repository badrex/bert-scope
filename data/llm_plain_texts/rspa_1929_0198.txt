tldr: This study investigates the lunar semi-diurnal tides in an ocean of uniform depth, using mathematical equations and calculations. The research provides insights into the co-tidal lines and tide ranges for this specific tidal component in the chosen ocean. The findings reveal that the forms of the co-tidal lines differ significantly from those in existing charts of the Atlantic Ocean, indicating the need for further research.
