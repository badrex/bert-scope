tldr: The authors study the distribution of spacings between adjacent energy levels in regular spectra of integrable systems, specifically focusing on harmonic oscillators. They find that the levels are correlated and exhibit a repulsion between adjacent levels, depending on the arithmetic nature of the frequency ratios of the oscillators. This theory is supported by numerical experiments on two-dimensional systems involving up to 10,000 levels.
