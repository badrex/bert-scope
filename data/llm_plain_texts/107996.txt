tldr: The author conducted magnetical experiments in the South part of Europe and Asia Minor between 1827 and 1832. They studied the relative magnetic forces and the effects of temperature on magnetism using various instruments and methods. The experiments aimed to determine the horizontal and dipping forces at different locations and compare the results to understand the variations in magnetism.
