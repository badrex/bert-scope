tldr: This article discusses the development of travelling waves in a simple isothermal chemical system with quadratic autocatalysis and quadratic decay. It shows that a travelling wave can be initiated for all values of the non-dimensional ratio of decay to autocatalytic reaction rates, and examines the structure of these travelling waves, their speed, and the limits of the system.
