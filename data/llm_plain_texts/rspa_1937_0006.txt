semantic_tags:
  - Amino acids
  - Zwitterions
  - Dissociation constants
  - Molecular dimensions
  - Ionization
tldr: The authors discuss the dissociation constants and structures of zwitterions, specifically focusing on amino acids. They explore the influence of charged and uncharged substituents on the dissociation constants and provide a theoretical approach to calculate molecular dimensions of amino acids. The study highlights the importance of understanding the chain effect and charge effect on the ionization process.
