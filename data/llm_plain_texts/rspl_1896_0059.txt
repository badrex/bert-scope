tldr: The author analyzes the presence of gallium in clay-ironstone from the Cleveland district of Yorkshire and provides a detailed account of the methods used to determine the quantity of gallium present. They employ fractional precipitations, spectrographic analysis, and gravimetric determinations to separate and quantify the metals in the sample. This research contributes to the understanding of the composition of ironstone and the extraction of valuable elements from it.
