tldr: This article discusses the long-term prospects for wood usage in Britain, considering factors such as timber availability, competition from other materials, and the importance of successful forest regeneration. It concludes that while there will likely be enough wood to meet demands for the next hundred years or so, the nature and quality of the material available will change, and successful regeneration of forests, particularly in tropical areas, is crucial for the future of wood beyond that time frame.
