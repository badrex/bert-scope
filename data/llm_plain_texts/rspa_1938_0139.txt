tldr: The authors conducted an X-ray investigation of slowly cooled copper-nickel-aluminium alloys, exploring the entire ternary system and identifying eleven single-phase areas, twenty-two two-phase areas, and ten three-phase areas. They discovered eight new structures related to a body-centered cubic lattice and three face-centered cubic phases, including a superlattice. This research helps in understanding the phase boundaries and composition of these alloys.
