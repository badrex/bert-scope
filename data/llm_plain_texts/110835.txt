tldr: This paper discusses the research conducted by Erasmus Wilson on a newly discovered parasitic animalcule, the Entozoon folliculorum, which lives in sebaceous follicles of the human skin. Wilson corrects previous inaccuracies in the description of the animalcule's structure and provides detailed anatomical information about its various organs, including the retraction apparatus, eyes, ova, and embryonic development stages.
