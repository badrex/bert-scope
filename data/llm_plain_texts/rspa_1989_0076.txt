tldr: This article explores the Bondi mass and mass flux in the exterior vacuum region of an isolated gravitational source using numerical relativity. The author derives expressions for the Bondi mass and mass flux by employing an arbitrary Newman-Penrose null tetrad in the conformally related spacetime. A numerical tool is developed to relate the near field of a gravitationally radiating system to the far field, allowing for the calculation of the system's mass and energy loss.
