semantic_tags:
  - Enzyme action
  - Hexosephosphate
  - Fermentation
  - Yeast-juice
  - Enzyme extraction
tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the action of enzymes on hexosephosphate, a compound involved in the fermentation process. They found that enzymes from various sources, such as castor oil seeds and yeast-juice, can hydrolyze hexosephosphate. The study also showed that the enzyme hexosephosphatase can be extracted from autolysed yeast-juice, which has significant implications for understanding fermentation and enzyme action.
