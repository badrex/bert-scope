tldr: The article discusses the chemical structure, activation, and molecular heterogeneity of bovine carboxypeptidase A. The enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of carboxyl-terminal peptide bonds in peptides and proteins. The study reveals that carboxypeptidase A has a complex structure and multiple products of activation, leading to variations in its chemical structure and amino acid sequence.
