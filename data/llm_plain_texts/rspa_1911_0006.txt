tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the density and atomic weight of radium emanation, also known as niton. They used a highly sensitive balance to measure the weight of the emanation evolved from a known amount of radium. The results showed that the atomic weight of niton is approximately 222, which is consistent with the periodic table. This research helped to advance the understanding of radioactive decay and the properties of radium and its byproducts.
