tldr: 'The article discusses the structural and functional specificity of Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) receptors in controlling cell growth. FGFs are a group of polypeptide mitogens that elicit various responses depending on the target cell type. The molecular cloning of FGF receptor tyrosine kinases has revealed a diverse family with at least four members. These receptors, along with proteoglycans, play a crucial role in FGF binding and signal transduction. The article highlights the different receptor forms, their activation by various FGFs, and their expression in different cells and tissues.'
