tldr: 'This study found that the venom glands of formicine ants contain microgram quantities of hexadecanol, hexadecyl formate, and hexadecyl acetate. These compounds are not found in the venom itself but are located in the convoluted gland. The presence of these compounds may protect the tissue from the corrosive venom and form a monolayer film on the secretory ducts.'
