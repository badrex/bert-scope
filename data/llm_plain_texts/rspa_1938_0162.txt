tldr: The authors conducted a series of experiments to analyze the fine structure of the first spark spectrum of iodine. They used advanced spectroscopic techniques to measure the nuclear spin and the interactions between the electrons and the nucleus. Their findings provide a better understanding of the atomic structure of iodine and its implications for nuclear electrical quadrupole moments.
