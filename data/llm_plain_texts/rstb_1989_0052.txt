tldr: This paper summarizes the current understanding of the micrometeorology of thin windbreaks and forest edges, focusing on the effects of shelter belts on microclimate and the principles governing their aerodynamics. The authors discuss the development of similarity laws and their application to the study of windbreaks and forest edges, as well as the impact of turbulence, porosity, and stability on wind reduction and microclimate modification.
