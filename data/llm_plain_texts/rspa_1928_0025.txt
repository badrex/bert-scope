tldr: The authors explore the relationship between the quantum theory and the metrics of space, specifically focusing on the effects of gravitational and electromagnetic fields. They propose a new way to measure the length of a line element and discuss the wave equation for an electron moving in an electromagnetic field. The authors suggest that the wave equation represents a law of metrics and is comparable to the law of gravitation.
