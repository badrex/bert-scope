tldr: The authors present a continuum theory of disorder in nematic liquid crystals, treating them as a continuum with a perfectly aligned ground state. They consider a spectrum of distortion modes involving splay, twist, and bend, thermally excited with amplitudes determined by the Frank stiffness constants. The theory predicts values for the conventional order parameter and higher order parameters, agreeing adequately with experimental results.
