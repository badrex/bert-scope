tldr: The study investigates the steady motion of an incompressible fluid within a curved pipe under a constant mean pressure gradient. The research focuses on the characteristics of flow when the Dean number is large, and proposes an asymptotic description for the fully-developed laminar flow within a general symmetric section. The findings provide insights into the fluid dynamics of curved pipes and have implications for understanding blood flow in the human aorta and other physiological applications.
