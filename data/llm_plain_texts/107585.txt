tldr: The author, Everard Home, describes the discovery of the ovum in the human uterus and its connection to impregnation. By examining a woman's uterus after her death, Home was able to identify the ovum and its development, providing new insights into the reproductive process. This discovery challenged previous theories about menstruation and conception, and helped to advance the understanding of human reproduction.
