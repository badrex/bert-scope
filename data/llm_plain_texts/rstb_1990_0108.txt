tldr: This article presents the findings of zoological expeditions to the Krakatau Islands in 1984 and 1985, focusing on the birds of the archipelago. The authors recorded 55 species of birds, including 14 species recorded for the first time in the decade. The study provides a baseline for future work on bird recolonization and discusses the implications for island biogeography theory. The authors also describe their survey methods, which were non-destructive to protect the fragile populations on the islands.
