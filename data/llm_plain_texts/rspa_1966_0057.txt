tldr: This article discusses recent advancements in the technique of seismic recording and analysis, focusing on interpreting array records of explosion and earthquake P waveforms that have traveled through the deep mantle. The author highlights the significance of low ambient noise locations and array summation in improving signal-to-noise ratios, and examines the effects of transmission paths and signal-generated noise on teleseismic records. The findings have important implications for studying earthquake mechanisms and understanding the structure of the Earth's interior.
