tldr: The Redbank Deformed Zone in Central Australia displays heterogeneous deformation on all scales. Microstructural and fabric observations indicate that the heterogeneities arise from inhomogeneous deformation during individual tectonic events and fault reactivation. Fault reactivation is preferentially localized in regions where superimposed fabrics are parallel or sub-parallel to the original fabric. The study of the Redbank Deformed Zone provides insights into the structural history of ancient fault systems and the localization of reactivation in fault systems.
