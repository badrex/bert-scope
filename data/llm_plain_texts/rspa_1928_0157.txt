tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of strong electric fields on the current from a thermionic cathode. They found that the current increases with the applied voltage and discovered a method to determine the value of the electronic charge. The results provide insights into the velocity distribution of electrons and the thermionic emission process.
