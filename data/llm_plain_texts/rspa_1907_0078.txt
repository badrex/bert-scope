revised_title: 'The Sun's Influence on Terrestrial Magnetism and Atmospheric Conductivity'
semantic_tags:

  - Solar radiation
  - Ionization
  - Electromagnetic effects
tldr: The author investigates the diurnal variation of terrestrial magnetism and concludes that it is caused by electric currents circulating in the upper regions of the atmosphere. The study suggests that the sun is the source of ionization, with ultra-violet radiation being the most plausible cause. The author also discusses the connection between barometric and magnetic changes, and the importance of further research into the cosmical causes affecting the ionization of the upper atmosphere.
