tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of electric charge distribution on the aging of aerosols. They found that the rate of coagulation and surface loss of an aerosol is influenced by the fraction of negative and positive particles, the average charge of each sign, and the average radius. The results suggest that the rate of surface loss is increased by electric charges on the particles, and the coagulation and surface-loss constants can be related to the electric charge distribution at any given time.
