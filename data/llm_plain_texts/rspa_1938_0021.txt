tldr: The author, O. W. Richardson, discovers a new band system in the H2 spectrum, proving that the state formerly called XX is actually Iso* 2s2f. The new state has a significant impact on the structure of the H2 spectrum, leading to the discovery of two nearly coincident band systems ending on lser in the region. The author proposes provisional designations for the upper states as 12(a) and 1D(6) and leaves it to others to determine the correct designations and interpretation of the findings.
