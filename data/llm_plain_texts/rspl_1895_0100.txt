tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine if Röntgen X-rays affect the contact electricity of metals. They found that the X-rays caused a slight difference in potential between the metals, suggesting that the rays have an electrolytic effect on the contact potential. This discovery expanded the understanding of the properties of X-rays and their potential applications.
