tldr: The authors study fossilized beetle assemblages to understand the changing environmental conditions in Great Britain and Ireland during the Devensian (Last) cold stage. Beetles are abundant fossils in Quaternary deposits and display a remarkable degree of evolutionary stability, making them valuable components in interpreting past environments. The authors analyze beetle fossils from different interstadial periods, providing insights into the climate fluctuations during the Devensian cold stage.
