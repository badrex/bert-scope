tldr: The article discusses the response of Antarctic climate to increasing carbon dioxide concentrations using general circulation model experiments. The results show that processes in the Southern Ocean around Antarctica are crucial for determining the global pattern of temperature change as CO2 levels rise. The study highlights the importance of including Antarctic processes in climate models to better understand and predict climate change effects.
