tldr: Professor Hansteen presents a research on the secular changes of the Earth's magnetic system, focusing on the secular variation of magnetic inclination in the Northern Temperate Zone. By calculating older and newer observations of magnetic declination, he determines the movement of the four magnetic polar regions and attempts to explain the cause of variations in declination, inclination, and intensity.
