tldr: This article discusses recent advancements in analytical infrared spectroscopy, a powerful tool for qualitative identification of chemical species. It highlights the development of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometers, which offer high sensitivity, speed, resolving power, and frequency reproducibility compared to dispersive spectrometers. The article also explores various applications of FTIR spectroscopy, such as atmospheric analysis, surface studies, and planetary atmosphere studies. Despite the growth of FTIR spectrometers, dispersive instruments still have their place in analytical chemistry due to their affordability and precision.
