tldr: The authors present four main findings in their study of rotating charged dust in general relativity. They derive an exact and explicit non-cylindrically symmetric solution for charged dust rotating with constant angular velocity in Newton-Maxwell theory. They also find a general solution of the main equation describing differential rotation in Newton-Maxwell theory for particles of equal mass and charge. Additionally, they derive a new exact and explicit solution of the cylindrically symmetric Einstein-Maxwell interior equations for charged dust rotating with constant angular velocity. Lastly, they show that for cylindrically symmetric, differentially rotating charged dust in general relativity, there exists a solution in which the Lorentz force on a typical particle vanishes.
