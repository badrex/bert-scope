tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the nuclear spin and fine structure of arsenic using spectroscopy. They found that arsenic has a single isotope, 75, and analyzed the fine structure of the majority of its visible lines. The results provide important theoretical significance and contribute to the understanding of atomic physics.
