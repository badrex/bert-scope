tldr: The authors investigated the transfer of vibrational energy in hydrocarbons, focusing on ethylene and paraffin hydrocarbons. They found that higher paraffin hydrocarbons are more effective in transferring vibrational energy, which they attribute to molecular flexibility and other aspects of the hydrocarbon structure. This study provides insights into the energy transfer between hydrocarbon molecules and the role of molecular structure in energy transfer efficiency.
