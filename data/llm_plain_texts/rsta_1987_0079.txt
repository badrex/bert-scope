tldr: The article discusses the technique of resonance ionization spectroscopy (RIS), which can detect single atoms by using lasers to selectively ionize atoms based on their known spectroscopy. The author explains the RIS principle, its applications, and some examples, including the detection of 81Kr for solar-neutrino research, ice-cap dating, and groundwater dating. The technique has potential for sensitive analyses but requires further development and improvements in technology.
