tldr: The authors construct a non-local kinetic equation for a plasma in a highly magnetized environment, where charged particles coincide with their guiding centers and have zero drifts. They demonstrate that, although mass transport occurs only along the field lines, heat transport cannot be confined only in the direction of the magnetic field. The study estimates a finite cross-field heat flux that can be driven by collisions between like particles at the limit, leading to a modification of the classical dependence of thermal conductivity.
