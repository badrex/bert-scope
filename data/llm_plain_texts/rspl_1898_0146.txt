tldr: The author investigates the stomatal behavior and adaptation in plants, particularly in Xenia, using a hygroscope to measure stomatal transpiration. They observe the effects of light, temperature, and environmental factors on stomatal opening and closing, and discuss the possible mechanisms behind these processes. The author also suggests that stomatal behavior may be related to plant irritability and adaptation.
