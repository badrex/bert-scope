revised_title: 'Breeding and Genetic Manipulation of Crop Plants for Behavior-Controlling Chemicals'
semantic_tags:
  - Plant breeding
  - Genetic manipulation
  - Pheromones
  - Antifeedants
  - Crop protection
tldr: The article discusses the possibilities of breeding crop plants that produce insect pheromones and other behavior-controlling chemicals, as well as obtaining antifeedants from natural sources for protection against invertebrate pests. The potential role of genetic manipulation in these approaches to crop protection is also considered. These methods aim to create safer and more effective crop protection procedures while addressing concerns about pesticide resistance and environmental impact.
