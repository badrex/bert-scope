tldr: The authors conducted experiments on monkeys to study the effects of cerebellum lesions and the resulting symptomatology and degenerations. They observed disturbances in station, locomotion, and muscular effort, and analyzed the degenerations following different types of lesions. The research provided insights into the connections and functions of the cerebellum and its related structures.
