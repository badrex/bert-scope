tldr: The authors explore the use of canonical co-ordinates in solving equations of axially symmetric gravitational fields. They demonstrate this through the case of an infinite rotating cylinder and a rotating sphere, providing solutions to the equations and discussing the effects of rotation on the gravitational field.
