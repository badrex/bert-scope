tldr: This article presents experiments on the specific heats of gases at constant volume, focusing on carbon dioxide. The author, J. Joly, extends the research to higher densities, where the substance is partly in the liquid state. The results show that the specific heat of carbon dioxide at constant volume can be expressed in terms of its variation with density, providing a better understanding of the gas's thermodynamic properties.
