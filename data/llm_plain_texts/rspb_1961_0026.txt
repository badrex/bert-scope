tldr: The study investigates how environmental temperature affects the structure of synapses in the central nervous system of lizards. The researchers found that altering the temperature from 19 to 32Â°C causes three types of structural changes in the lizard's brain, which are reversible and take from 1 to 4 weeks to occur. These changes involve synaptic structures and may provide useful experimental tools for studying the functional significance of the altered parts.
