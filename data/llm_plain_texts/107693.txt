tldr: 'This article discusses experiments conducted by William Prout on the changes that occur in the fixed principles of an egg during incubation. Prout analyzed the egg's components, such as the shell, albumen, and yolk, and their changes during incubation. He found that the specific gravity of eggs decreases during incubation, and the saline and earthy matters undergo various transformations. Prout also analyzed the chemical composition of eggshells and the yolk, providing insights into the nature of these components and their role in egg development.'
