tldr: This article discusses the physical processes and modeling of the plasmasphere and its interactions with the high-latitude ionosphere. It explores the transport equations for the plasma, the influence of plasma drifts, and the importance of understanding the behavior of the high-latitude ionosphere for effective modeling. The article also presents some results on convective drift effects in the mid-latitude plasmasphere.
