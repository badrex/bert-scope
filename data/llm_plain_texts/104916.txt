tldr: In 1755, a learned gentleman from Naples discovered ancient writings and books buried in the ruins of an edifice near Herculaneum. The rolls were made of papyrus and contained Greek and Latin texts. Despite the challenges of preserving the fragile papyrus, efforts were made to unroll and read the texts, including the use of innovative techniques by Father Antonio. One of the unrolled texts was a philosophical tract on music by a Greek writer in Plutarch's style, criticizing its negative effects on society. The process of unrolling and preserving these ancient texts was time-consuming and labor-intensive, but the discovery offered hope for uncovering more valuable works.
