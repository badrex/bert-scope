tldr: 'This study examines the functional characteristics of dorsal horn neurons in adult rats treated with capsaicin at birth. Researchers found that the receptive field sizes of these neurons were larger in rats treated with capsaicin, and the post-synaptic efficacy of remaining C fibers appeared to be the same as in control rats. These findings suggest that neonatal capsaicin treatment may decrease tonic descending inhibitory influences, leading to changes in pain processing.'
