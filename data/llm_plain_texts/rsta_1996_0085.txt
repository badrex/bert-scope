tldr: This special issue explores the significance of curved surfaces and triply periodic minimal surfaces in modern structural and synthetic chemistry. It highlights the progress and excitement in solids with three-dimensional surfaces, their relevance to chemical and crystallographic taxonomy, and their impact on materials science and applied chemistry. The volume covers various milestones and growth points, including fullerenes and mesoporous silica, and their applications in shape-selective catalysis, biomineralization, nanotechnology, and more.
