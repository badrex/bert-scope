tldr: The author conducted extensive research on the meteorology and rainfall patterns in the Lake District of Cumberland and Westmoreland. They analyzed data from various stations and gauges to understand the distribution and quantity of rain in the region. The author discovered that the amount of rain increases from the valley to an altitude of about 2000 feet, after which it rapidly decreases. They also found that the temperature in these valleys is higher than commonly imagined and discussed the implications of their findings for future research.
