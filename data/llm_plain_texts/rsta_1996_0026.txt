tldr: This article describes various techniques for generating high repetition rate, high-quality soliton pulse trains in the range of 10 GHz to 1 THz. The authors focus on nonlinear conversion methods, such as dispersion-modified fibers, self-Raman scattering, and phase-modulated sideband extraction. These techniques can be used for high-bit-rate optical communication systems and other applications.
