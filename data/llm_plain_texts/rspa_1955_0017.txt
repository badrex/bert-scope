tldr: The authors extend the classical Helmholtz theory of incompressible flow around obstacles with constant-pressure cavities to include compressible subsonic flow around curved obstacles with varying bubble pressures. They apply the theory to calculate the flow past a circular cylinder for various points of flow separation and Mach numbers, demonstrating good agreement with experimental results.
