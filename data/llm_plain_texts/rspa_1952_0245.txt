revised_title: 'A Discussion on Friction and Surface Deformation'
semantic_tags:
  - Friction
  - Surface Deformation

  - Plasticity
  - Lubrication
tldr: This article discusses the factors that influence friction and the likelihood of plastic deformation between surfaces. The authors argue that plastic deformation is more likely than suggested by Professor Blok, especially with rough surfaces and non-parallel ridges. They also highlight the importance of elastic deformation of surface irregularities in hydrodynamic lubrication.
