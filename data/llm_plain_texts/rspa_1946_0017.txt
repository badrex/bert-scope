tldr: This article investigates the fields and equations of motion for point particles with charges, dipoles, and higher multipole moments interacting with fields of any spin. The authors show that the radiation field and its derivatives are always finite at all points, including those on the particle's world line. They also introduce the modified symmetric field, which has important properties near the world line and simplifies the equations of motion for point particles.
