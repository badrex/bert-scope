tldr: Dr. William Brownrigg, a physician and chemist, conducted groundbreaking research on the poisonous gases in coal mines during the 18th century. His work led to a better understanding of the risks associated with coal mining and contributed to the development of safety measures. Despite his significant contributions, Brownrigg did not receive the recognition he deserved during his lifetime, partly due to his preference to stay in his native Cumberland rather than moving to London.
