tldr: This lecture discusses the discovery and study of monomolecular layers, or monolayers, on water and their properties. The author explains the importance of short-range forces in adsorption and how these forces lead to the formation of monolayers. The lecture also covers the spreading of oil on water, the orientation of molecules in monolayers, and the use of surface balances to measure the surface tension of monolayers.
