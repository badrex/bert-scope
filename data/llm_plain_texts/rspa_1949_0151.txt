tldr: The authors studied the polymerization of sarcosine carbonic anhydride, a reaction important for synthesizing polypeptides and understanding a less common type of polymerization. They found that the reaction involves a reversibly formed compound between the carbonic anhydride and the polymer, which decomposes through unimolecular and bimolecular routes. The equilibrium constant and velocity constants for the decomposition were determined, and the molecular weight distribution was calculated to be extremely sharp.
