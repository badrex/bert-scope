  - Lignin
  - Hemicellulose
  - Pectin
  - Lignification
tldr: The authors investigate the chemical changes that occur during lignification in plant cell walls. They identify and categorize the substances involved, including lignins, hemicelluloses, and pectins. The study shows that hemicelluloses found in lignified tissues are derived from pectins through decarboxylation, a process that can be replicated in vitro using weak alkalis at low temperatures.
