tldr: The author discusses the formation of coals and chars, proposing that they are not just residues of arboreal and swamp vegetation but a reworked, condensed material, similar to a natural Bakelite. The process involves the transformation of organic materials under specific conditions, such as water and oxygen absence, and the role of bacterial action in decay. The author also explores the role of peat, shales, and vegetable humus in coal formation, emphasizing the need for further research in this area.
