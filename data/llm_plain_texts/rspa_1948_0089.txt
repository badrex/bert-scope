tldr: The authors studied the rate of hydrolysis of the ester group in the monocetylsuccinate ion by hydroxyl ions as a monolayer reaction. They found that the hydrolysis constants show a significant decrease when referred to the concentration of alkali in the surface rather than the bulk phase. The study also explains the slowing down of alkaline hydrolysis of neutral esters of long-chain acids by considering the existence of a surface phase.
