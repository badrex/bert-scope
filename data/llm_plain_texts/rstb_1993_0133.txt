tldr: The article investigates the site-specific glycosylation of CD4 and Thy-1 proteins and how the protein structure influences oligosaccharide processing. The study finds that the local amino acid sequence and micro-environment of the glycosylation site play a crucial role in determining the type of oligosaccharides attached to the protein. The results suggest that protein structure has a significant impact on glycosylation patterns and may have functional implications in cellular interactions.
