tldr: This article discusses the role of hormones in the sexual differentiation of the central nervous system and its impact on reproductive cycles in mammals. The authors explain how the presence of testosterone during early neonatal life can lead to masculinization of the central nervous system, resulting in altered reproductive cycles and behaviors in female rats. The study provides insights into the hormonal regulation of reproductive functions and the development of the brain.
