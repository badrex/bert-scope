tldr: The author describes the post-mortem examination of an asthmatic patient, revealing that the cause of death was due to two factors: emphysema and varicose affection of the pulmonary vein. The patient had a history of violent vomiting, which likely caused both conditions. The emphysema and varicose veins prevented the lungs from functioning properly, leading to difficulty in breathing and eventually death.
