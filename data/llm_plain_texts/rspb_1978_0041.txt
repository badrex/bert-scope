tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of Corynebacterium parvum on chemical carcinogenesis in mice. They found that a course of intravenous injections of C. parvum before a single injection of methylcholanthrene significantly delayed or prevented the development of fibrosarcomas in CBA mice. The results suggest that macrophages play a key role in inhibiting cancer growth, and further research is needed to understand the mechanism behind this phenomenon.
