tldr: The authors investigate the role of extracellular matrix molecules, laminin and tenascin, in the development and regeneration of the leech central nervous system (CNS). They find that these molecules influence neurite outgrowth and form, suggesting a key role in neuronal development and regeneration. Laminin and tenascin are present in the leech extracellular matrix and have structurally similar but not identical properties to their vertebrate counterparts.
