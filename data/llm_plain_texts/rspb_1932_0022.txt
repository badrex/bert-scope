tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effects of spaced radiation on tissue cultures in vitro. They found that spaced radiation has a similar impact as a continuous radiation of 2.5 minutes with 300 milligrams of radium. The study showed that a spacing interval of about 80 minutes between two irradiations produces the greatest effect on mitosis. The results suggest that spaced radiation can temporarily delay cell division and increase the radiosensitivity of cells.
