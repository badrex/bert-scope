tldr: The authors studied the morphological and physiological changes in dissociated adult frog muscle fibres after prolonged culturing. They discovered that the fibres developed striated muscle sprouts, which could form functional neuromuscular junctions with embryonic Xenopus neurons. The cultured fibres showed slow hyperpolarizing regenerative responses, indicating that new skeletal muscle fibres can be formed from outgrowths of adult muscle fibres and can accept motor innervation.
