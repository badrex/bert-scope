tldr: James Logan conducted experiments on the impregnation of seeds in plants, specifically focusing on Indian corn. He discovered that the male seed, or farina, is essential for the growth and development of seeds. His experiments showed that when the male seed was removed or obstructed, the seeds would not grow, but when left intact, the seeds would develop normally. This research highlights the importance of male seed in plant reproduction.
