tldr: The author discusses the restricted range of volcanic rocks found on the ocean floor and proposes that the viscosity of magma plays a crucial role in determining which types of magma can penetrate the oceanic crust to emerge on the ocean floor. The author suggests that a "low-viscosity window" exists, allowing only the most fluid lavas to pass through the barrier and reach the surface, while more viscous magmas are unable to do so.
