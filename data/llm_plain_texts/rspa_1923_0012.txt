tldr: The author investigates the gyromagnetic ratio in ferromagnetic substances and explores the role of electron orbits in the magnetization process. They propose that the ratio is influenced by the contribution of the positive and negative charges in the atom, and that the magnetism of iron is due to a pair of parallel or coplanar orbits with a single azimuthal quantum.
