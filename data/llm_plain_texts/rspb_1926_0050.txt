tldr: The authors conducted experiments using tissue cultures in vitro to study the direct effects of X-radiation on cells in mitosis. They discovered that small doses of X-rays significantly decreased the number of cells in normal mitosis, while larger doses led to a complete disappearance of cells in mitosis. The study also observed abnormalities in the mitotic cells after receiving certain doses of X-rays. This research provides valuable insights into the biological response to irradiation and the potential effects of radiation on living cells.
