tldr: This article discusses the rigidification of behaviour in animals and humans during stress situations. It explains how animals in captivity create abnormal rituals and motor patterns due to the lack of environmental variability, leading to a simplified nervous system response. The author highlights the similarities between these stereotyped patterns and animal rituals, and explores the common factors that explain their shared properties.
