tldr: This study investigates the absorption spectrum of gallium vapor, focusing on inter-subshell correlations and the simultaneous ejection of two photoelectrons. The researchers detected more than 90 transitions between 440 and 660 A and found that the quenching of one-electron excitation is more pronounced in Ga I than in In I. The findings provide insights into the behavior of atomic gallium and its implications for atomic physics and spectroscopy.
