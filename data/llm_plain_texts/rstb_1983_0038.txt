semantic_tags:
  - Protein Phosphorylation
  - Muscle Contraction
  - Myofibril
  - Troponin I
  - Myosin Light-Chain Kinase
tldr: The article discusses the role of protein phosphorylation in the regulation of contractile activity in muscle. It focuses on the phosphorylation of myofibrillar proteins, such as tropomyosin, troponin I, and the P light chain of myosin. The study highlights the importance of these phosphorylation processes in modulating the contractile response in striated muscle and the activation of actomyosin ATPase in vertebrate smooth muscle.
