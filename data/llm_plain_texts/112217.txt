tldr: The author examines distorted skulls found at Wroxeter and investigates the causes of the deformities. He concludes that pressure alone cannot explain the distortion, and suggests that the acidity of the soil, particularly the presence of carbonic and nitric acids, plays a significant role in dissolving and softening the bones, leading to the deformities. The distortion occurs at an early stage after burial when the animal matter of the bones is still present.
