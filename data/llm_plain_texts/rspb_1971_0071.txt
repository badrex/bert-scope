tldr: This study investigates the role of separated gas in decompression procedures and challenges the current theories on which decompression tables are based. The authors found that the incidence of decompression sickness increases when a conditioning exposure to pressure is followed by a test exposure, even if the test exposure is shorter. This suggests that gas bubbles are present in symptomless decompressions and raises the question of gas transport to the lungs as a factor that should be considered in designing decompression tables.
