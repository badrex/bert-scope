tldr: The authors determined the velocity constants of propagation, transfer, and termination in the polymerization of vinyl acetate using the viscosity method. They found that the polymerization process involves four types of reactions: initiation, propagation, transfer, and termination. The study provides insights into the reaction mechanisms and helps improve the understanding of vinyl polymerizations.
