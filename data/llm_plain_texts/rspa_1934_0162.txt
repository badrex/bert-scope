tldr: The authors studied the homogeneous unimolecular decomposition of gaseous methyl nitrite, finding it to be a first-order reaction. They determined the rate of reaction and proposed a mechanism involving free radicals. The decomposition of other nitrites and the reaction at low pressures is still under investigation.
