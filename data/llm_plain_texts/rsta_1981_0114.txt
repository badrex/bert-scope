  - Earth's crust evolution
tldr: This article discusses the origin and evolution of Earth's continental crust through the study of granite plutonism and its relationship with plate tectonics. It explores the space-time trends of granitoid rocks and how they reflect changes in tectonic patterns, magma types, and crust mobility. The article also highlights the importance of understanding the Earth's long-term thermal decay in explaining crustal evolution.
