tldr: 'In alpine accentors, female song attracts males during the breeding season. Female alpine accentors sing complex songs during their fertile period, singing more when alone than when accompanied by mate-guarding males. Female songs elicit approaches from males but not from other females, and females often solicit copulations as soon as the male arrives. Playbacks show that males respond differently to and distinguish between male and female songs. This study suggests that female song in alpine accentors has evolved to attract mates and may advertise quality and receptivity for mating. Female song may also provide females with a mechanism for sharing mating access among several males, ensuring maximum paternal care for their offspring.'
