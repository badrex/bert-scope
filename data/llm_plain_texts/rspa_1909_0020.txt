tldr: The authors conducted a study on the electrical phenomena accompanying rain and thunderstorms in India. They found that the heavier the rainfall, the more positively charged the rain was. The study also showed that the breaking of water drops in the air led to the separation of positive and negative charges. The authors proposed a theory that ascending currents in thunderstorms cause water drops to accumulate and break, resulting in the separation of positive and negative charges, which eventually leads to positively and negatively charged rain.
