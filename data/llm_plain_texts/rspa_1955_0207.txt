tldr: The authors studied the effects of electrolytes on gaseous monolayers, specifically neutral films. They found that the surface pressure of the equimolar film increased with the ionic normality of the substrate solution. The results suggest that the film molecules in the surface are mobile and in reversible equilibrium with those in the bulk, and that the increase in surface pressure is due to substrate ions getting entangled with the film ions.
