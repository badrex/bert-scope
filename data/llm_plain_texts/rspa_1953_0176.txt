tldr: The authors conducted ultrasonic measurements in liquid helium to study the velocity and absorption of sound at frequencies of 2, 6, and 12 Mc/s over a temperature range from the normal boiling point to 0.85 K. They found that the attenuation is very high near the A-point and at low temperatures, and is proportional to w^2 between 1.2 K and the A-point. The results provide insights into the behavior of liquid helium and its implications for various theories.
