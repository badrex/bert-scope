revised_title: 'The Role of Sympathetic Nerves in Skeletal Muscle Function and Adrenaline Sensitivity'

tldr: The author's experiments demonstrate the function of sympathetic nerves in skeletal muscle and provide evidence for a humoral action. They found that the strength of the Orbeli response, which occurs when sympathetic nerves are stimulated, is dependent on the concentration of a chemical intermediary and the sensitivity of the muscle's motor end-organs to the intermediary. The author also discovered a relationship between a muscle's adrenaline sensitivity and its response to sympathetic stimulation.
