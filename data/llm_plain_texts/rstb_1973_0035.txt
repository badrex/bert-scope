tldr: The authors conducted excavations at St Erth, Cornwall, to study the Pliocene marine formation, which contains rich collections of marine mollusca and foraminifera. They describe the sediments and stratigraphy, as well as the results of detailed studies of the fossils (mollusca, foraminifera, ostracoda, and plants) in the marine clay. The findings suggest that the marine clay was deposited in a sea with a higher water temperature than present-day Cornwall, during the final Boytonian beds of the Pliocene Coralline Crag formation.
