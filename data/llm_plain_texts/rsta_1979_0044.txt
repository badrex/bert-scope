tldr: This article explores the optical caustics formed by liquid drops under gravity, focusing on the parabolic and symbolic umbilics. The authors observe the complex patterns created by drops on various surfaces and explain how these patterns can be understood through the concepts of parabolic and symbolic umbilics. They also discuss the role of gravity in shaping these patterns and the mathematical equations governing their formation.
