tldr: The authors conducted an experiment to study the glide of single crystals of sodium and potassium. They found that the glide direction is along the [111] direction, and the glide plane is near the crystallographic (123) plane. The study provides insights into the deformation and behavior of body-centered cubic crystals, which is essential for understanding their mechanical properties and potential applications.
