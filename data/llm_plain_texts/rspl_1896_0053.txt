revised_title: 'Synthesised Proteid-Like Substances and Their Physiological Reactions'
semantic_tags:
  - Proteins

  - Blood coagulation
tldr: The author synthesized several proteid-like substances and studied their chemical and physiological reactions. These substances cause intravascular coagulation of the blood when injected into animals, similar to the action of nucleo-proteids. The author also investigated the effects of precipitation and redissolving processes on the substances' properties and physiological actions.
