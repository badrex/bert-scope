tldr: This article studies the asymptotic expansion of multidimensional integrals using the concept of integration in the finite part sense of Hadamard. The authors derive the asymptotic expansion of up to order when the function is smooth enough. This expansion is proposed for with and is based on the use of the integration in the finite part sense of Hadamard.
