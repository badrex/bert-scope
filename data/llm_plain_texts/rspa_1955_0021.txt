tldr: This article investigates the explosive combustion of hydrocarbons using kinetic spectroscopy. The authors compare the absorption spectra of ethane, methane, and ethylene explosions and find that the continuous spectra are due to absorption by carbon particles. They also discover that a second continuous spectrum, with a characteristic maximum at 3900 A, is attributed to a carbon molecule in approximate thermal equilibrium. The study provides insights into the process of carbon formation and the role of radicals in explosive reactions.
