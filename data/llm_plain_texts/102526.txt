tldr: Roelof Diodati, the Supreme Director of the Council of Mauricius, wrote a letter to Mr. Witsen about an extraordinary inundation that occurred in the island. The river near Noordwyck suddenly swelled, causing significant damage to the sugar mill, sugar work, and surrounding area. The cause of the sudden swelling remains unknown, as there were no earthquakes or other similar occurrences in nearby rivers. The water receded just as suddenly, returning to its normal height.
