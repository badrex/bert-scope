tldr: The author examines a petrified Williamsonia cone from Scotland, providing a detailed description of its morphology and anatomy. The cone is found in Jurassic rocks alongside other plant fossils, and its structure suggests it may be a reduced form of a pinnate frond. The author also discusses the possible connections between this fossil and other cycadean plants, as well as the absence of a well-defined base in the strobilus.
