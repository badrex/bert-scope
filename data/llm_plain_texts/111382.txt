tldr: The author investigates the composition and formation of serpentines in Canada, discovering a uniform composition across various samples and the constant presence of small amounts of nickel. The study also reveals the association of nickel with chromic iron and serpentines in other regions, such as Pennsylvania, California, and the Vosges in France. The author discusses the presence of other minerals and rocks associated with serpentines, such as talcose slates, magnesites, dolomites, and euphotides.
