tldr: The author investigates the innervation and reflex movements of antagonistic muscles in spinal animals. They observe that the response to stimuli can vary depending on the initial posture of the limb and the location of the stimulus. This suggests that the direction of spinal reflex movements can be influenced by the posture of the limb at the time of stimulus application.
