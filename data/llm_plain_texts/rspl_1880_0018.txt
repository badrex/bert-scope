tldr: The author conducted actinometrical observations in India at Mussooree and Dehra to study solar radiation and its variations. They used two actinometers to measure changes in solar energy and discussed the effects of local conditions, such as atmospheric stratus and cumulus clouds, on the measurements. The observations were taken at different times of the day to establish a time-range for inconstancy of radiation due to varying zenith distances.
