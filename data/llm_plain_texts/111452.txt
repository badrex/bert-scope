tldr: The author, Arthur Cayley, explores the automorphic linear transformation of bipartite quadric functions, which are lineolinear functions of two distinct sets with the same number of variables. He presents a theorem that shows how any matrix satisfies an algebraic equation of its own order and demonstrates the application of this theorem in finding the general expression of matrices convertible with a given matrix.
