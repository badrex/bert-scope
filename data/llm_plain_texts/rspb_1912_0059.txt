  - Plant Enzyme Distribution
tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the distribution and characteristics of enzymes in plants, specifically focusing on enzymes that break down glucosides. They found that these enzymes, such as linase, amygdalase, prunase, and salicase, have varying distributions in different plant species. The study also highlights the importance of understanding the influence of season and environmental factors on enzyme activity in plants.
