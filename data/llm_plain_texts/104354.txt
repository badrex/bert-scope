tldr: The author describes a case where a gentleman experienced a severe urinary problem due to the discharge of hair along with his urine. Despite various treatments, the problem was resolved only after the hair and gritty matter were removed. The author discusses the possibility of the hair being extraneous or generated in the urinary passages and suggests that the mouths of the lacteals may be perceptible in living bodies when dilated with chyle.
