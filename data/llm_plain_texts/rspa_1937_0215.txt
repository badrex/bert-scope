revised_title: 'Critical Phenomena in a Two-Dimensional Gas: The Interaction of Atoms and Molecules with Solid Surfaces'
semantic_tags:
  - Statistical mechanics
  - Two-dimensional gas
  - Critical phenomena
  - Lennard-Jones potential
  - Gas theory
tldr: The authors apply a method used for three-dimensional gas to a two-dimensional case, calculating two isotherms and estimating that the critical temperature of a gas in two dimensions is about half that in three dimensions. This study helps understand the behavior of atoms and molecules on solid surfaces.
