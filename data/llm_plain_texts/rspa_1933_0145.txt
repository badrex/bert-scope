tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the photoelectric emission from tungsten and molybdenum under the action of soft X-rays from copper. They found that heating the photoelectric plates increased the emission, and that the increase was due to the removal of a chemical residue. The results showed that the photoelectric current could vary by a factor of about 2 depending on the surface condition of the metal. This study provided insights into the photoelectric effect and the behavior of metals under X-ray radiation.
