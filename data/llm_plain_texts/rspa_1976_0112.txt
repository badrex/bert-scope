tldr: The authors present a method to calculate the potential energy surfaces of interacting molecules using the spin-coupled formalism. They expand the total energy in powers of electron interchange and develop a comprehensive diagram technique to obtain any term in the expansion. This approach is suitable for calculating intermolecular potentials between non-bonded systems and for determining interaction potentials in the long and intermediate range for bonded systems.
