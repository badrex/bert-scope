tldr: The article is a biographical memoir of Robert Edward Bell, a distinguished Canadian physicist and Fellow of the Royal Society. Bell made significant contributions to nuclear physics, including the measurement of the binding energy of the deuteron, the development of a novel K-band scanner, and the study of positronium lifetimes. He also played a crucial role in transferring nuclear research and the use of radioactive materials to Canadian hospitals and universities.
