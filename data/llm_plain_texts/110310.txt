tldr: Jacob Perkins conducted experiments on the evaporation of water on heated iron surfaces. He discovered that the time required for evaporation depends on the temperature of the iron. At higher temperatures, water is removed from contact with the metal by a layer of steam. To produce steam efficiently, water must be in close and constant contact with the heated metal.
