tldr: This article discusses the mechanisms of salt and water transport in fish gills, specifically in freshwater and seawater environments. The gills play a crucial role in maintaining mineral and water balance in fish. The study highlights the functional differences in gill function between freshwater and seawater environments and the changes that occur when euryhaline fish migrate between these environments. The article also explores the role of enzymes, such as carbonic anhydrase and Na-K activated ATPase, in the ionic pumps of fish gills.
