tldr: This article discusses the origins and evolution of eukaryotic proteins, focusing on the enigmatic nature of the eukaryotic cell and its unique cytoskeleton. The author examines the evolution of cytoskeletal proteins, such as actin and tubulin, and explores the implications of their slow rate of change on our understanding of eukaryotic origins. The article highlights the challenges in determining the common ancestry of eukaryotes, archaebacteria, and eubacteria and the importance of studying protein evolution to unravel the mysteries of life's early history.
