tldr: The author, J. W. Lubbock, conducted a study to determine the influence of the moon's declination on the height of the barometer. He combined observations from various sources and found that there is an elevation of nearly one-tenth of an inch for every seventeen degrees of declination. This inequality has a contrary sign to the inequality of the same argument in ocean tides.
