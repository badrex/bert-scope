tldr: This article discusses the calculation of the optical spectrum terms in atoms with one series electron using the Hartree equations. The author explains the approximations made in determining the core wave functions and their impact on series electron wave functions and values. The article also explores the use of Fock equations and the self-consistent field method in atomic physics.
