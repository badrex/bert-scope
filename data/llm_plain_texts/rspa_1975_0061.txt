tldr: This article discusses the observations of radio frequency noise made by the Ariel 4 satellite. The observations were conducted using a 12 m electric dipole and a narrow-band receiver that either swept from 0.25 to 4.0 MHz every 16 seconds or operated at a fixed frequency of 2 MHz. The authors identified three distinct types of noise, with one being naturally occurring and associated with specific regions of the CMA diagram. The Ariel 4 satellite's observations complemented and extended previous studies on noise in the ionosphere.
