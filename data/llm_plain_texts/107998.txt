  - Absorption and radiation
  - Experiments
tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the influence of color on heat absorption and radiation. They discovered that color has a significant impact on how much heat a surface absorbs and how quickly it radiates heat. This finding could have implications for designing more efficient heating and cooling systems.
