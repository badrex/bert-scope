tldr: The article is an obituary for Henry Crozier Plummer, a notable astronomer who made significant contributions to the study of globular clusters, stellar motions, and spectroscopy. Plummer's work on the distribution of mass in globular clusters and his classification of these clusters based on central concentration laid the foundation for future research in the field. He also made important discoveries in stellar motions and spectroscopy, including the first analysis of the hypothetical parallaxes of type A stars.
