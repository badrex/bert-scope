tldr: In this article, Sir William Ramsay and Professor J. Norman Collie describe their attempts to map the spectrum of radium emanation. They explain their experimental setup and the challenges they faced due to impurities. They successfully observed the spectrum, which had a striking resemblance to the spectra of the gases in the argon group. The authors identified several strong lines in the spectrum, and their findings contribute to the understanding of radium emanation and its properties.
