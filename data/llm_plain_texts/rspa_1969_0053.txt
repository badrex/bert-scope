tldr: The authors developed a new model for viscoelastic relaxation in liquid mixtures, which can predict the behavior of binary mixtures of supercooled liquids in alternating shear. The model introduces a single additional constant, K, into the equation for the complex compliance, allowing for better fitting of experimental results for various mixtures and pure liquids that do not conform to the original model. This new model provides a more accurate representation of the viscoelastic properties of liquid mixtures.
