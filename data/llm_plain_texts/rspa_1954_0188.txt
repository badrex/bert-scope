tldr: This study measures the laminar flame speed of propane/air mixtures using a unique porous burner that allows for heat extraction from the flame. The researchers found that the flame speed decreases as more heat is removed, and they were able to determine the flame speed in gases of reduced initial temperature. This method provides a more accurate way to measure flame speed and can be applied to other combustible mixtures.
