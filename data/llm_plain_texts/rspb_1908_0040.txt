tldr: This study examines the giant nerve cells and fibers in the marine worm Halla parthenopeia. It describes the formation, structure, and function of these large cells and their fibers, which play a crucial role in the worm's nervous system. The research also compares the giant cells of Halla parthenopeia to those of another species, Aglaurides fulgida, finding similarities in their structure and arrangement of neurofibrillar networks.
