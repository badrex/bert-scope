tldr: The authors conducted microscopic studies on the oxidation of layered solids, such as graphite and MoS2, to understand the enhanced reactivity at structural faults in solids. They found that high-energy dislocations and indigenous or created vacancies in the surface act as active centers for oxidation. The studies help identify the actual structural defects that function as active centers and evaluate the degree of enhanced reactivity.
