tldr: The authors conducted a quantitative analysis of the growth of Helianthus annuus, focusing on the plant's respiration throughout its life cycle. They determined the respiration rate at various stages of the plant's development and found that the respiratory index, a measure of the "internal" factor for respiration, can be related to the plant's nuclein nitrogen content. This study provides insights into the interconnection of internal factors affecting plant growth and respiration.
