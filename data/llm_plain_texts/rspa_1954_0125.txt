tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the behavior of liquids between rotating rollers and observed the onset of cavitation. They found that cavitation sets in at a rarefaction of about 2 atm for castor and paraffin oils, consistent with hydrodynamical theory. The results provide insights into industrial processes involving liquid films and roller technology.
