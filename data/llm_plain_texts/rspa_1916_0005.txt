tldr: This paper investigates the skin friction of high winds on Earth's surface, proposing a theoretical model and comparing it to experimental data. The authors find that skin friction is proportional to the square of wind velocity and is consistent with laboratory experiments on small flat plates and pipes. The study contributes to understanding the interaction between the atmosphere and Earth's surface.
