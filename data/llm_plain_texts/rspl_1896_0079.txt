tldr: 'The article discusses the discovery of the Zeeman effect, a phenomenon where spectral lines of light are broadened when a magnetic field is applied. The author, Oliver Lodge, verifies Dr. P. Zeeman's findings and explains how the effect is connected to the interchange of energy between ether and matter. The discovery is linked to the work of Lorentz, who developed a theory that describes the interaction between matter and ether through the movement of electrons.'
