tldr: This article discusses the temperature distribution and heating mechanisms in the thermosphere, focusing on the influence of conductivity and the role of various gases in the atmosphere. The author argues that the temperature gradient likely decreases rapidly above the base of the thermosphere layer, rather than remaining constant. The article also examines the discrepancies between different measurements and theories regarding the thermosphere's temperature and heating processes.
