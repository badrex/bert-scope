tldr: The authors constructed and analyzed a series of synthetic RNA polymerase III promoters using chemically synthesized double-stranded analogues of the box A and box B consensus sequences. They found that these two boxes, when separated by approximately 50 base pairs, are sufficient to direct efficient transcription, and that substitution of certain nucleotides causes reduced template activity.
