tldr: The authors studied the effects of injecting inositol trisphosphate (IP3) into Xenopus oocytes to understand how it influences intracellular calcium levels and membrane currents. They found that IP3 injection caused slow, rising, and decaying aequorin/calcium signals and produced oscillatory chloride membrane currents. These responses did not depend on extracellular calcium, suggesting that IP3 releases calcium from intracellular stores in the oocyte.
