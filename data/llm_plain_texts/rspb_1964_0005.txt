tldr: The author investigates the efficiency of mechanical power development during muscular shortening and its relation to load. They confirm Aubert's findings that the ratio of work done to heat produced remains constant during shortening at constant speed or load. The efficiency of mechanical power development is highest around a specific load, with 44% or more of the total power being used by the muscles delivered externally in mechanical form.
