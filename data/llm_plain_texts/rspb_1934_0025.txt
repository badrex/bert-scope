tldr: The authors investigated the antiseptic properties of various amino derivatives of styryl and quinoline. They found that these compounds showed potent antiseptic activity against staphylococcus and B. coli bacteria, with little or no diminution in action when present in serum. The study continues the authors' previous work on the antiseptic properties of quaternary salts of 2(jo-amino anil or styryl) quinoline.
