tldr: The authors used pyrene-labelled actin to study the dynamics and equilibria of the interaction between myosin subfragment 1 and the actin-troponin-tropomyosin complex in rabbit skeletal muscle. They found that the presence of troponin-tropomyosin in the presence of calcium increases the affinity of myosin subfragment 1 for actin sixfold. Kinetic studies revealed an isomerization of the actin-subfragment 1 complex, which is affected by the presence of troponin-tropomyosin.
