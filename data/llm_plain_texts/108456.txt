tldr: The author examines the composition of chylous urine, which is white due to the presence of fatty matter. They find that albumen, fibrin, blood-globules, and alkaline salts can be present in the urine before food intake and can be influenced by rest or motion. The author disproves the idea that a disease causes fat accumulation in the blood, which is then excreted by the kidneys. Instead, they suggest that other factors, such as diet and physical activity, may affect the composition of chylous urine.
