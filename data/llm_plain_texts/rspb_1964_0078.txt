tldr: The authors studied the mountain soils of Mount Kinabalu's east ridge during the 1961 Royal Society Expedition. They found that the soils were influenced by altitude, parent rock, and local relief, resulting in diverse soil characteristics. The authors also discussed the differences in soil types in various forest zones and their implications for the ecosystem.
