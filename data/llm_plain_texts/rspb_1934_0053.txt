tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the kinetics of hemoglobin's reaction with carbon monoxide. They found that the reaction is slower than the reaction between oxygen and hemoglobin, and the extreme slowness of carbon monoxide hemoglobin dissociation is responsible for its 200-fold greater affinity. The author also tested the effects of pH, temperature, light, and salt concentration on the reaction and discussed the implications of their findings.
