tldr: The authors present various direct numerical methods to solve the singular nonlinear transonic integral equation, which is essential for understanding transonic flow around aerofoils. They discuss the limitations of standard numerical techniques and propose alternative methods to improve accuracy and computational efficiency. The methods are compared and evaluated, showing improvements over previous works in both numerical accuracy and computational economy.
