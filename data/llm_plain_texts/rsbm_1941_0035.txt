tldr: This obituary celebrates the life and achievements of H. S. Hele-Shaw, a pioneering engineer and educator. Hele-Shaw founded three important engineering colleges and made significant contributions to the fields of kinematics, integrating mechanisms, and fluid dynamics. His work on stream line flow and the transparent boundary in fluid mechanics was particularly notable, and he developed a method using air bubbles as tracers to visualize the flow of water past objects.
