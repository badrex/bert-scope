tldr: The author investigates the oscillations of a Schwarzschild black hole and its normal-mode frequencies, which are relevant in various processes involving dynamical perturbations of a black hole. The phase-amplitude method is used to calculate these frequencies with high accuracy, providing a powerful alternative to previous investigations of the normal-mode problem.
