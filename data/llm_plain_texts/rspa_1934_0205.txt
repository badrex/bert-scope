tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the catalytic activity of palladium in the union of hydrogen and oxygen. They discovered that the activity of the catalyst depends on its pre-treatment, and that palladium can be temporarily inert when exposed to hydrogen. The authors suggest that a compact layer of adsorbed hydrogen may act as a protective covering, preventing the catalysis process from occurring. Further research is needed to test these hypotheses.
