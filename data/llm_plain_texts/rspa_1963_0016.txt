tldr: The authors studied the paramagnetic resonance and optical absorption of trapped holes and electrons in irradiated KCl:Ag crystals. They discovered that silver impurity ions act as traps for both electrons and positive holes, providing detailed information about the electron excess and deficient centers formed due to low-temperature irradiation.
