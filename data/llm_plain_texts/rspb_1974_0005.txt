tldr: The authors conducted an autoradiographic study to understand the formation of enameloid and dentine matrices in teleost fishes using tritiated amino acids. They discovered that the collagenous matrix of dentine is laid down incrementally, while enameloid matrix is a composite tissue containing collagen and an amelogenin-like protein. The inner dental epithelium plays a significant role in enameloid mineralization and may be responsible for initiating the removal of collagen from the matrix. The study provides insights into the evolution of enameloid and its relationship to dentine and enamel in teleost fishes.
