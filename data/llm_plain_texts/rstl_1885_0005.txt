  - Polarization
  - Electromagnetism
  - Lord Rayleigh
tldr: 'The author, Lord Rayleigh, investigates the phenomenon of magnetic rotation of light in bisulphide of carbon. He discusses the methods used to measure the rotation and the importance of accurately defining the light source. The study helps to determine the velocities of propagation of circularly polarized rays and contributes to the understanding of electromagnetism and optics.'
