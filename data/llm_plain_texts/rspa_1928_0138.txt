tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the Zeeman effect in the band spectrum of helium. They observed that the helium band spectrum lines broadened and diminished in intensity when exposed to a magnetic field. The results showed that the effect of the magnetic field on the band lines was less than the width between the outer components in the normal atomic Zeeman triplet. The study aimed to understand the behavior of helium's band spectrum under magnetic fields, which could help improve spectroscopic investigations.
