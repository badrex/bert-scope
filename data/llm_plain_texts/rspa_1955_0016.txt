tldr: The author presents a theoretical approach to calculate the Hall coefficient in a single crystal of graphite with the magnetic field and current oriented in specific directions. The study focuses on the four conduction bands of graphite and the trapping states, considering the distribution of electrons according to Fermi-Dirac statistics. The results are compared with experimental data on polycrystalline graphite, providing insights into the behavior of the Hall effect in graphite materials.
