tldr: The author proposes a modification to twistor diagram theory, using a non-projective approach and incorporating the twistor scale, to eliminate the infrared divergence in first-order massless Moser scattering. This new formalism, called inhomogeneous twistor diagrams, offers a fresh approach to the divergences of quantum field theory.
