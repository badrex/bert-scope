tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the relationship between the minimal lethal dose of toxic substances and the body weight of warm-blooded animals. They found that the minimal lethal dose can be expressed as a function of the body surface area, which is proportional to the blood volume. This discovery led to the conclusion that dosage must be proportional to body surface area in warm-blooded animals, improving the understanding of drug administration and therapeutic action.
