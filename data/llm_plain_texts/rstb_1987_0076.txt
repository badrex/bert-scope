tldr: The article describes the identification of multiple cellular factors required for SV40 replication in vitro. Researchers have identified three fractions, I and II, which when combined, support efficient DNA synthesis. These factors play a crucial role in the replication of eukaryotic chromosomes and provide a foundation for understanding the mechanism of DNA replication.
