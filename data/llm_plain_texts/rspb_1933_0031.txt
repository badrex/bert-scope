tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the effect of monovalent, divalent, and trivalent salts on the absorption of ammonium ions by potato tuber tissue. They found that monovalent salts, such as lithium chloride, increase ammonium absorption, while divalent and trivalent salts, like calcium and aluminium chlorides, decrease it. The study suggests that the antagonistic action of ions depends on two factors: competition with the accompanying ion and the specific effect of the ion on the tissue's absorptive power.
