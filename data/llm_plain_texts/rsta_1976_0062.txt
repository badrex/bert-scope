tldr: The authors study the accidental degeneracies of Bloch waves in high energy electron diffraction and their effects on diffracted waves and Kikuchi patterns. They use analytic semiclassical approximations to predict which Bloch waves can degenerate and develop an inversion technique to infer the potential in real space from critical voltage and critical angle measurements.
