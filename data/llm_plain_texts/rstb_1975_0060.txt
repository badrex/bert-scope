tldr: The article discusses the role of the cell surface in the selection and transport of proteins from the mother to the foetus and newborn. It examines the process of protein uptake by endodermal cells in the yolk sac splanchnopleur, chorio-allantoic placenta, and small intestine. The author suggests that selection occurs at the cell surface through different uptake processes, rather than intracellular events as previously believed. This understanding helps explain how the foetus and newborn mammal acquire essential amino acids and protection against invasive organisms.
