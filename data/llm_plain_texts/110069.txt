tldr: 'The author, William Henry, studied the action of finely divided platinum on various gaseous mixtures and its application to their analysis. He found that different gases were acted upon with varying ease, with hydrogen and carbonic oxide being the most reactive. The author also discovered that by regulating the proportion of hydrogen, it was possible to convert all the carbonic oxide into carbonic acid without affecting other gases. Additionally, he proposed a method to obtain pure carburetted hydrogen using platinum as a catalyst.'
