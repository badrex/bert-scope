tldr: The authors study the ferroelectric behavior of potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP) and its phase transitions. They find that the hydrogen bonds play a crucial role in the phase transition, while the magnitude of the polarization is determined by the heavy ions. The authors develop a theoretical model based on the Ising model and the hydrogen lattice of KDP to explain the ferroelectric properties and phase transitions in KDP.
