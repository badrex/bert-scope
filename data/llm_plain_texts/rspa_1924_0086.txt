tldr: This article explores the possibility of Saturn's ring being elliptical and examines the stability of an elliptic ring using mathematical models. The author demonstrates that an elliptical ring can maintain its form with small disturbances and suggests that further investigation into the permanent forms of Saturn's ring could provide valuable insights.
