tldr: The author, James Ford, describes his successful use of agaric and fungus vinosus in amputations to control bleeding. He explains his suspicion that the effect of agaric is due to its texture rather than any specific stypticity, and shares his experience using fungus vinosus as an alternative. The author also shares two case studies where the fungus was applied, demonstrating its effectiveness in stopping blood loss during and after amputations.
