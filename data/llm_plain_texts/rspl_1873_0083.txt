tldr: This article investigates the physiological effects of various chinoline and pyridine bases on different animals. The authors found that there is a gradation in the extent of physiological action in the pyridine series, while the action of the chinoline series changes in character as they move from lower to higher members. The bases containing a larger amount of hydrogen showed greater physiological activity. The study also found that these substances do not have specific paralytic action on the heart but can cause death through convulsions or respiratory paralysis.
