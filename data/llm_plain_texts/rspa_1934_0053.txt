tldr: 'The authors analyzed the crystal structure of Heusler alloys using X-ray diffraction and self-consistent field methods. They found that in the specimen studied, there was a deficit of manganese atoms, and the excess aluminium atoms were distributed equally in the positions normally occupied by copper and manganese.'
