  - Ethyl-aniline
tldr: The authors describe a new method for synthesizing ethyl- and methyl-aniline from Hofmann gum, a waste byproduct of the aniline dye production process. They also discuss the properties of these compounds, including their solubility and reactivity with acids. The discovery of these new sources of aniline has potential applications in the dye industry.
