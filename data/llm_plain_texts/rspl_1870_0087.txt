tldr: This article presents an analysis of the magnetic observations recorded by the horizontal and vertical force self-recording magnetometers at the Kew Observatory from 1859 to 1864. It shows a progressive decrease in the number and intensity of disturbances during this period, with a minimum in 1863. The study also examines the distribution of disturbances affecting the Earth's magnetic field in different years, months, and hours.
