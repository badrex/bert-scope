tldr: The authors studied the molecular scattering of light in vapors and liquids, focusing on the relationship between this phenomenon and critical opalescence. They investigated the scattering of light in ether in both liquid and saturated vapor phases at various temperatures, and found that the scattering power of the gas was far greater than expected if the "principle of random phase" were valid. The results showed that the scattering power of the saturated vapor, liquid, and gaseous phases approached each other and converged to a very large value at the critical point, highlighting the importance of considering higher-order terms in the Einstein-Smoluchowski formula.
