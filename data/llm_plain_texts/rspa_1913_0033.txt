tldr: The author presents a simple method for finding the approximate period of stable systems, such as structures or ships, by considering them as equivalent pendulums. This method is useful in practical engineering work and can help determine the stiffness and deflections for a given load. The author also discusses the effects of corrections on the period of structures and shares a real-life example of using this method to determine the flexure of a vertical column under lateral force.
