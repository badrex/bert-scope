tldr: 'Charles Glover Barkla was a renowned physicist who made significant contributions to the field of X-rays. He discovered that scattered X-rays are polarized and that each chemical element can emit X-rays with properties unique to that element. Barkla's work laid the foundation for the development of crystallography and the understanding of the nature of X-rays as electromagnetic waves.'
