tldr: This article introduces a new method for evaluating local fields and overall properties of inelastic composite materials subjected to incremental thermomechanical loads. The approach relies on transformation influence functions and concentration factor tensors, which can be evaluated using micromechanical models. The method is suitable for composite aggregates with multiple inelastic phases and various elastic material symmetries and geometries. Applications to elastic-plastic, viscoelastic, and viscoplastic systems are discussed, and the new approach is compared with self-consistent and Mori-Tanaka approximations, which are shown to violate exact relations between local and overall inelastic strains.
