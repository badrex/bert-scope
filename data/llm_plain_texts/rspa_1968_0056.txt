revised_title: Geometry and Algebra of Representations of the Lorentz Group
semantic_tags:

tldr: The authors develop a spinor analysis for higher representations of the Lorentz group, introducing a geometrical representation of spinors as points in a projective space. They discuss the algebra of these quantities and their connection with more conventional objects, providing a foundation for further applications in physics and mathematics.
