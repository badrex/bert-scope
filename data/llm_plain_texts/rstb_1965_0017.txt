tldr: The 1961 volcanic eruption on Tristan da Cunha had a significant impact on the island's fauna, particularly in the areas closest to the eruption site. The study found that the invertebrate fauna was severely affected by the lava and ash, with some species losing their habitats and possibly going extinct. However, the vertebrate fauna seemed to be less affected by the eruption, with birds and seals showing no signs of damage. The research highlights the importance of understanding the effects of volcanic eruptions on local ecosystems and the need for conservation efforts to protect vulnerable species.
