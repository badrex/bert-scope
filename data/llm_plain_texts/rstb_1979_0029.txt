tldr: 'This study examines the relationship between Aldabran giant tortoises and white-throated rails. It is found that when a tortoise adopts a cooperative posture in response to tactile or visual stimuli, a rail may clean the tortoise of ectoparasites. This mutualistic relationship appears to be ecologically unimportant for both species and their ectoparasites.'
