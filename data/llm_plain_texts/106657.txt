tldr: Edward Jenner's observations on the natural history of the Cuckoo focus on the bird's nesting habits and its unique ability to lay its eggs in the nests of other bird species, such as the Hedge-sparrow, for them to raise its young. Jenner also discusses the Cuckoo's migration patterns and the behavior of the young Cuckoos in the nest.
