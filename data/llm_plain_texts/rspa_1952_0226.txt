tldr: This article investigates the anomalous skin effect in metals at low temperatures and high frequencies. The authors found that the electronic mean free path plays a significant role in the skin effect, and they studied the behavior of various metals, including copper, silver, gold, tin, cadmium, lead, and aluminum. The results showed that the skin effect is sensitive to surface imperfections, and the authors discussed the impact of these imperfections on the measurements.
