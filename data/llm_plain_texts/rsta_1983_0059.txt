tldr: This article explores the masses of multiquark states in the MIT bag model, taking into account flavor symmetry violations. The author uses the P-matrix formalism to analyze the eigenstates and compare them to experimental data, finding agreement with the bag model predictions. The study focuses on color-hyperfine spectra and provides a comprehensive survey of the multiquark hadron sector.
