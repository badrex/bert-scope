tldr: The authors studied the solubility behavior of irradiated polyethylene and other polymers, focusing on the effects of radiation-induced crosslinking and degradation. They found that the net effect of radiation on a polymer depends on the ratio of crosslinking to dislinking (bond-breaking) events. The authors also derived radiation parameters for various polymers, providing insights into their molecular weight distributions and solubility behavior.
