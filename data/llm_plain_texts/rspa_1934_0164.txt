tldr: The author investigates the concept of the vacuum in Dirac's theory of electrons, exploring the idea that the vacuum is filled with an infinite number of electrons of negative kinetic energy. They discuss the potential influence of an external electromagnetic field on the motion of these electrons and the possibility of a vacuum polarizability, which could have implications for the effective charge of observed particles.
