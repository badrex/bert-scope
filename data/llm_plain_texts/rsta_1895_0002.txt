tldr: The author analyzes the photographic spectrum of the Orion Nebula using the thirty-inch reflector and a spectroscope by Hilger. They identify fifty-four lines in the spectrum, with hydrogen being a major component of the nebula's vapors. The study also reveals the presence of other elements and lines, some of which have unknown origins. The author discusses variations in the spectrum and the challenges of analyzing the photographic spectrum due to differences in sensitive films and tarnished mirrors.
