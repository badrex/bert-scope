tldr: The author investigates the entanglement of polymers in melts and concentrated solutions, focusing on the plateau modulus and its relation to the concentration of entangling loci. They propose a method to directly calculate the entanglement and reconcile different theories, finding that the local environment plays a significant role in establishing the modulus's magnitude.
