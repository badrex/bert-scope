tldr: The authors investigate the surface ionisation of potassium by tungsten and its potential for creating a steady, intense, and long-lasting beam of positive ions. They study the process of ionisation, the build-up and breakdown of equilibrium, and the factors affecting ionisation efficiency. The experiments provide insights into the behaviour of fast K+ ions striking a hot target and the potential applications of this ion source in further research.
