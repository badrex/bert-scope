tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the ionization of hydrogen gas by X-rays, focusing on the role of recoil electrons. They found that the energy absorbed by hydrogen gas from the incident X-ray beam could be correlated with the energy in the beam, and compared their experimental results with the predictions of the quantum theory of recoil scattering.
