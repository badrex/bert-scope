tldr: The author examines the morphology and evolution of spore-producing members in plants, focusing on the sporophyte generation. They discuss the concept of antithetic alternation, where the sporophyte generation arises from the fertilized ovum and has a distinct phylogenetic history. The author also explores the role of sterilization in the evolution of plants and the methods of morphological change.
