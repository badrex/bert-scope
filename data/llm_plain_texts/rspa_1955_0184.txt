tldr: The author investigates the reflection of vertically-incident long radio waves from the ionosphere when the Earth's magnetic field is oblique. They develop approximate equations for the reflection of plane electromagnetic waves from a horizontally stratified anisotropic ionosphere and divide the ionosphere into two regions with different equations governing the propagation of waves in each region. The author provides an analytical solution for a model in which the electron density distribution is exponential and the collision frequency is constant, and discusses the overall reflection and conversion coefficients for the combined effects of the two regions on an incident wave.
