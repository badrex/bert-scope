tldr: 'In 1769, a massive hailstorm struck Buckland Brewer, causing significant damage to the church tower. The hailstones were unusually large and heavy, with one weighing almost 8 pounds. The storm's intensity was compared to the discharge of a hundred cannons at once. The church's south-east corner suffered the most damage, with stones from the church pinnacle scattered in all directions.'
