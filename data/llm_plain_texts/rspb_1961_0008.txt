tldr: 'The study investigates the hormonal control and chemical acceleration of the maturation process in male desert locusts. It demonstrates that a chemical substance produced by mature males can accelerate the maturation of young locusts. The substance is released through olfaction and contact, and its presence is indicated by a vibration reaction. The corpora allata, endocrine glands in males, control sexual maturation and related processes, such as the production of the accelerating substance and color change.'
