tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the resonance levels and radioactive yield in magnesium isotopes, specifically Mg24 and Mg25. They discovered that both isotopes have similar resonance levels and that the resonance effect is associated with the emitted particle rather than the bombarding particle. The authors also found that the resonance levels for Mg25 are closely similar to those of Mg24, and that the widths and peak values of the resonance levels are nearly the same.
