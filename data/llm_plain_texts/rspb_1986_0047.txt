tldr: This article documents the historical record of erect bryozoan growth forms and presents a hypothesis to account for their limited number. The study examines general categories of form, branch, and surface widths and patterns of changes within categories to determine whether colony forms are limited in type or if types differ substantially through time or between classes and orders in which they developed. The strict limitation on branch width is released where water can be vented locally back in the direction from which it came.
