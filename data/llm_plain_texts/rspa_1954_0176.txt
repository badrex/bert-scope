tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the thermal diffusion factor in various gas mixtures, including hydrogen-deuterium, nitrogen-argon, oxygen-argon, and nitrogen-carbon dioxide. They found a reversal of sign in the thermal diffusion factor for some mixtures, which occurs when the heavier molecules diffuse up the temperature gradient instead of down. This phenomenon was predicted by the Lennard-Jones model, but the experimental results show that this model is not quantitatively satisfactory.
