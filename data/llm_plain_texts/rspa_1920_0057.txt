tldr: The author discusses the use of vacuum grating spectroscopy in the extreme ultra-violet region, focusing on the use of helium gas. They describe the design and operation of a vacuum grating spectrograph, and its potential for studying the absorption spectra of elements. The author also shares their experience with previous designs and improvements made to the apparatus for better performance and airtight seals.
