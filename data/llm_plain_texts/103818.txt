tldr: The authors conducted experiments on phosphorus urine, exploring its properties and its ability to transform into glass. They discovered that phosphorus, which consists of a subtle acid concentrated by the salt of urine and a fat-depurated oil, can be deflagrated and sublimed, yielding a white salt that can be vitrified into glass. This process demonstrates the transmutation of bodies and the potential for further research into phosphorus and its properties.
