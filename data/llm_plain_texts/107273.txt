tldr: This article discusses the effect of westerly winds on the water level of the British Channel and the resulting currents. The author, James Rennell, explains how these currents can impact the navigation of ships in the area, particularly during storms. He also describes the differences in current direction and strength on either side of the Strait of Dover and how this influences the overall water flow.
