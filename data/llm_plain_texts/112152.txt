tldr: This article discusses John Davy's observations and experiments on birds' temperature, respiration, and excretion. He found that birds have a higher temperature than mammals due to their low vascularity, feather insulation, and efficient heart circulation. The author also studied the air in birds' bones and the composition of their excretions, suggesting that these factors contribute to their high temperature.
