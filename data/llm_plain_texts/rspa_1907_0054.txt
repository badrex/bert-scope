revised_title: 'The Origin of Gases in Mineral Springs and Their Connection to Rock Composition'
semantic_tags:
  - Geochemistry
  - Mineralogy
  - Radioactivity
  - Gas composition
  - Geological processes
tldr: The author examines the gases evolved by mineral springs and finds a resemblance between the gases of mineral springs and the gases of rocks. They conclude that the disintegration and partial solution of ordinary rocks by water at a high temperature account for the gaseous products delivered by springs. The author also discusses the connection between helium in rocks and radioactivity, suggesting that helium may be generated in situ by radioactive change.
