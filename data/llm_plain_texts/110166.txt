tldr: 'Edward Sabine conducted experiments to determine the difference in the length of the seconds pendulum in London and Paris. He used two pendulums, one made for M. Schumacher and another belonging to the Board of Longitude. The comparison was made at the Royal Observatory in Paris, and the results showed a final acceleration of 12.00 for the seconds pendulum in passing from Paris to London. This research helped to establish more accurate standards of length and time measurement.'
