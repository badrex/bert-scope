tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the ejection of protons from nitrogen when bombarded with short-range alpha particles. They discovered that disintegration occurs at lower ranges than previously thought and found that over 80% of ejected protons occur between 30-150 degrees. The study also suggests the existence of resonance levels in the nitrogen nucleus.
