tldr: The authors conducted experiments on secondary radiation from gases and light solids exposed to X-rays. They discovered that the character of this radiation is similar to the primary radiation, and its energy is proportional to the quantity of matter the X-ray beam passes through. The authors proposed a theory that X-rays consist of a succession of electromagnetic pulses, and the electrons in the medium cause secondary radiation. They found that secondary beams perpendicular to the primary beams are plane-polarized, and the intensity of the secondary radiation depends on the primary beam's polarization. The authors also observed partial polarization in X-ray beams from an X-ray tube.
