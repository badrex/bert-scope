tldr: This article presents a study on the scattering of mesotrons in metal plates, providing important evidence about the nature of cosmic-ray particles. The authors found that the scattering of mesotrons is mainly due to the Coulomb field of the nucleus, and the distribution of scattering angles follows a Gaussian pattern. The study also estimates the action cross-section of mesotrons with nuclear particles, contributing to the understanding of mesotron-proton and mesotron-neutron interactions.
