tldr: The authors conducted a study on post-estrous changes in the generative organs and mammary glands of non-pregnant dogs. They discovered that the persistence of the corpus luteum spurium over a considerable period in dogs is associated with uterine and mammary development, similar to what occurs in pseudo-pregnant rabbits and marsupial cats. This research provides insights into the hormonal regulation of reproductive cycles in dogs and other mammals.
