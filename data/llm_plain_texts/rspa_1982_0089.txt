tldr: The authors present an improved theory of nuclear interactions in a cubic doublet system, focusing on the electronic Zeeman and nuclear magnetic hyperfine interactions. They develop a general theory for the case when the magnetic field is in an arbitrary direction and discuss special cases, such as along the [111] axis and the spectrum of a concentrated compound with fast flip-flops between electronic states.
