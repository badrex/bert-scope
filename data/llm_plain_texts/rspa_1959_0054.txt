tldr: This article presents a theoretical analysis of the interaction between two iridium ions in an antiferromagnetic crystal structure. The author uses group theory to classify the states and examine the contributions to the Hamiltonian. The lowest energy level of the two iridium-chlorine complexes breaks up into a singlet and a triplet, with the singlet-triplet separation related to various exchange integrals.
