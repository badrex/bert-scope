tldr: This article examines the dentition and mandible of the extinct marsupial Thylacoleo carnifex, challenging previous claims that it was a herbivorous animal. The author presents evidence from the structure and function of its teeth and compares it to other marsupials and herbivorous animals, concluding that Thylacoleo was more likely a carnivorous species.
