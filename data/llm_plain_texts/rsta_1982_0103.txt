tldr: The author discusses the distribution and composition of intergalactic clouds at large red-shifts, focusing on the single Lyman-a absorption lines in quasar spectra. They propose that these lines are produced by primordial intergalactic clouds, which can provide information on the state of the intergalactic medium and element production in the Big Bang.
