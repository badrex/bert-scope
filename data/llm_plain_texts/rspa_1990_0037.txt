tldr: The author investigates the steady linear convection-diffusion equation in unsaturated soil flow and proposes a roof boundary-layer analysis for certain boundary-layer equations. They introduce the concept of natural coordinates, which are essential for the boundary-layer analysis and can accurately determine the crucial dimensionless potential for water entering underground cavities. The author presents conjectures on the use of natural coordinates and boundary-layer equations in fluid dynamics.
