tldr: This article discusses the management of Antarctic krill and mackerel icefish stocks in the Southern Ocean, focusing on the impact of environmental changes on their distribution and abundance. The authors emphasize the importance of understanding the relationship between krill and its predators, as well as the effects of oceanic circulation patterns on these resources. They conclude that while it is currently difficult to detect changes on a Southern Ocean scale, local changes, such as those observed at South Georgia, can have significant effects on the krill fishery and the natural mortality of the icefish.
