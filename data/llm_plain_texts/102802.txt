tldr: In a letter to Dr. Tyson, Dr. Wallis discusses the possibility of humans being naturally adapted to consume plant-based diets rather than flesh. He raises the question of whether animals that do not consume meat have a specific digestive structure, and whether carnivorous animals have a different one. Wallis also mentions the role of reason in human adaptation to different needs and the variety of teeth structures in humans.
