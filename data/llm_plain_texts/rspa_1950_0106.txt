tldr: This article presents a comprehensive study of heat transfer in laminar boundary layers, focusing on the development of an approximation method for calculating heat rates across a laminar boundary layer. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the energy equation in von Mises form and discuss various cases, including uniform and non-uniform main-stream velocities and wall temperatures. The study offers insights into heat transfer in high-speed flight and its implications for the temperature distribution on surfaces of airfoils, projectiles, and other bodies in the atmosphere.
