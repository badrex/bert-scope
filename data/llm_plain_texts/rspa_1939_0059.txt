tldr: 'This article investigates the mechanism of polymerization reactions, specifically focusing on the polymerization of styrene and methyl methacrylate. The authors find that the rate of chain propagation is the limiting factor in the polymerization process. They also study the effect of catalysts, such as benzoyl peroxide, on the polymerization process and its impact on the molecular weight of the resulting polymers.'
