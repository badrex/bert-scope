tldr: The author examines the crystal structure of haloid compounds of silver, focusing on silver chloride, silver bromide, and silver iodide. They analyze the atomic volumes and densities of these compounds, providing insights into their molecular arrangements and properties. The study also highlights the unique behavior of silver iodide, which transitions from a hexagonal to a cubic structure upon heating.
