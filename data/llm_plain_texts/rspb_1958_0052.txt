tldr: The authors studied the effects of drug-induced reversible and irreversible enzyme alterations in bacteria, specifically Escherichia coli, and how these changes contribute to drug resistance. They discovered that when bacteria are exposed to sub-inhibitory concentrations of a drug, they can develop the ability to synthesize folic acid more efficiently, making them resistant to the drug. This resistance can be reversible or irreversible depending on the drug concentration and the duration of exposure.
