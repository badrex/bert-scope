tldr: This article by William Thomson introduces the concepts of stress and strain in solid materials. Stress is defined as an equilibrating application of force to a body, while strain is any definite alteration of form or dimensions experienced by a solid. The author explains the properties of homogeneous stress and strain, and how they affect the behavior of materials under various conditions. The article also discusses the relationship between stress and strain, and how they can be used to understand the behavior of materials in engineering and other applications.
