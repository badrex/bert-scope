tldr: The author investigates the ionizing properties of positive ions and the ionizing potential for negative corpuscles using a direct method. They discovered that positive ions can cause ionization in gases through collisions, and the ionizing potential for negative corpuscles can be measured under different experimental conditions. This research contributes to understanding the behavior of charged particles in gases and their potential applications in various fields.
