tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the pressure experienced by the poles of metallic and composite arcs, including an investigation into the reactions consequent upon electron emission. They found that metallic arcs, such as copper, silver, and iron, experienced greater pressures than a carbon arc. The authors attributed the pressure to a recoil caused by the projection of electrons from the poles, which is supported by the order of magnitude of the calculated values associated with electrons.
