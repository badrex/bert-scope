tldr: The authors conducted a self-consistent calculation of the band structure of aluminium, considering the potential acting on a conduction electron and the effects of correlation and exchange. They used an effective potential that included the Bohm & Pines theory of a free-electron gas and the Hartree-Fock treatment of ion cores. The results agreed with the model of the band structure obtained from experimental data.
