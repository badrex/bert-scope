tldr: The author examines the transmission of radiant heat through glass screens, specifically investigating the accuracy of previous findings by M. De La Roche. The author's experiments support De La Roche's conclusion that the additional diminution of heat caused by a second glass screen is proportionally much less than that produced by the first. This phenomenon is explained without the need for new properties of heat or direct transmission through glass.
