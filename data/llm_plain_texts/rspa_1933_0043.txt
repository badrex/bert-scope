semantic_tags:
  - Alpha particles
  - Magnetic fields
  - Ionization chamber
  - Velocity determination
  - Radium C'
tldr: The authors used an annular magnetic field to analyze alpha particles emitted by radioactive substances, particularly radium C'. They determined the energies and velocities of these particles, providing a more precise understanding of their properties and behavior.
