tldr: The author discusses a framework for understanding and analyzing comparative data and phylogenies using a microevolutionary perspective. This framework can be used to infer the ancestral states of phenotypes, the strength and type of microevolutionary forces acting on characters, and the degree of phylogenetic inertia in a character. By incorporating phylogenetic or taxonomic information into the analysis, researchers can correct the problem of non-independence in comparative data and infer more accurate evolutionary patterns and processes.
