tldr: This article discusses the physical aspects of blade erosion in steam turbines, focusing on the impact of liquid deformation, rain damage in aircraft and missiles, and cavitation erosion. The authors explore the collection of droplets on turbine blades, the influence of vacuum on specimen weight loss, and the effectiveness of drainage systems in reducing erosion. They also investigate the erosion resistance of various materials and propose improvements in turbine design to mitigate erosion issues.
