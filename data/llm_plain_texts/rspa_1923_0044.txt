tldr: The authors present an improved method for measuring the electrical charge of colloidal particles using the moving boundary technique. They address the sources of error in previous methods and introduce a direct measurement of the potential gradient across the boundary. This new method allows for more accurate determination of the electrical charge and provides a better understanding of colloidal properties.
