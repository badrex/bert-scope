tldr: The study investigates the activity of neurons in the striate and prestriate cortex of trained rhesus monkeys while they fixate on a target. The researchers found four types of binocular depth-sensitive neurons that may contribute to depth perception. These neurons help process information for both fine and coarse stereopsis, providing a better understanding of how the brain perceives depth and three-dimensional space.
