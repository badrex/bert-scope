tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the pressure-concentration equilibria between silica gel and water and ethyl alcohol under isothermal conditions. They found that the water-silica gel system behaves differently from other analogous systems, showing non-reproducibility of equilibrium points, inability to follow the saturation pressure of water vapor, and irreversible pressure-concentration isothermals with hysteresis.
