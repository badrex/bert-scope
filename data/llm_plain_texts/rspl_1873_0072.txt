tldr: The authors conducted a detailed study of smallpox in sheep, a disease that closely resembles human smallpox. They investigated the anatomical changes and the role of microorganisms in the disease's progression. The study found that the disease starts in the rete Malpighii and the papillary layer of the corium, and progresses through stages of inflammation, vesicle formation, and pus-corpuscle development. The authors also discovered new microorganisms in the lymphatic system and the rete Malpighii, which play a crucial role in the disease's development.
