tldr: This article discusses the complex interactions between host heterogeneity and parasite polymorphism in malaria, focusing on the factors that contribute to the wide spectrum of disease severity in Plasmodium falciparum malaria. The authors propose that both host factors and parasite virulence play a role in determining disease outcomes, and that their combined effects can explain intriguing epidemiological observations, such as the reduction in severe malaria incidence in certain host genotypes without a concomitant reduction in mild disease. The authors use a mathematical model to explore the coevolutionary consequences of host resistance and parasite virulence in malaria transmission.
