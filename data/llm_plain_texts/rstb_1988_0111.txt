tldr: This article discusses the various patterns of environmental sex determination in reptiles, focusing on temperature-dependent sex determination. It describes experiments on the effects of incubation temperature on sex determination and development in Alligator mississippiensis eggs. The article also explores possible mechanisms of reptilian sex determination and their phylogenetic implications.
