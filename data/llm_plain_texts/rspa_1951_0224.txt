tldr: The authors conducted electrical resistivity measurements on gallium single crystals at low temperatures, finding that the anisotropy of this property increases in the low-temperature region. The 'ideal' resistivity is proportional to T, where T is the temperature. The results indicate that the electrical resistance of gallium varies nearly as in a free electron metal at low temperatures.
