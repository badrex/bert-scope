tldr: The article discusses the numerical modeling of twisted nematic devices in thermotropic liquid crystals. It reviews methods and recent advances in simulating laminar regions and illustrates bistable twist cells. The article highlights important problems of stability and edge effects in the presence of electric fields that require two- or three-dimensional simulations for a better understanding of the behavior of nematic and chiral nematic displays.
