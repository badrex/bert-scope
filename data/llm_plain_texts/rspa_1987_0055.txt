tldr: The article presents a study on the representation formulas for transversely isotropic elasticity tensors in hyperelastic materials. The authors show that only five independent constants, known as elasticities, are needed to specify such tensors. They also discuss the symmetry requirements and the number of elasticities required for different material symmetries.
