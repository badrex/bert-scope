tldr: The author critiques Bernard's glycogenic theory and his method of blood sugar analysis, which he claims is affected by post-mortem changes. He presents a new gravimetric method for analyzing blood sugar levels accurately during life, which provides more reliable results and corrects the errors in Bernard's method.
