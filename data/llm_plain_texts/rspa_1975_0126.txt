tldr: This study investigates the role of aggregation in the allosteric control of bovine glutamate dehydrogenase using quasi-elastic light scattering spectroscopy. The results show that aggregation affects the enzyme's activity, making the allosteric transition occur at a lower level of allosteric activation and making it a more abrupt function of the activation level. This finding has significant implications for the enzyme's role in protein metabolism.
