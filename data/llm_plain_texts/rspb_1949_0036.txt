tldr: The authors conducted experiments using tissue culture to study the effect of nerve fibers on Schwann cell migration during Wallerian degeneration. They found that reinnervation significantly reduced the amount of Schwann cell outwandering compared to non-reinnervated nerves. This discovery sheds light on the complex relationship between nerve fibers and Schwann cell migration, which is crucial for understanding nerve regeneration and repair.
