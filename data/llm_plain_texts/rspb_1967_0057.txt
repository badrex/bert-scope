tldr: 'This study examines the structural changes in ancient Indian timbers that have survived for up to 47,000 years. The researchers found that burial underground led to a reduction in cellulose content, both amorphous and crystalline, in the wood samples. The oldest specimen still had cellulose present but in a non-crystalline form. The findings suggest that cellulose degradation under these conditions proceeds by a rapid removal of amorphous or paracrystalline cellulose, followed by a slower conversion of crystalline to non-crystalline cellulose. The results have implications for understanding the natural durability of timber and the development of preservation methods.'
