tldr: The authors conducted experiments to demonstrate that the phenomenon of welding in iron and steel is identical to that of regelation in ice. They found that both materials expand when passing from the liquid to the plastic state and then contract to the solid state. The authors also discovered that wrought iron at welding temperatures possesses the same property of cooling under pressure, which was proven by Lord Kelvin to exist in freezing water. This finding helps to explain the useful property of welding in iron and steel.
