revised_title: 'Leg Design and Jumping Techniques in Vertebrates and Insects'
semantic_tags:
  - Jumping mechanics
  - Leg design
  - Muscle properties
  - Vertebrate locomotion
  - Insect locomotion
tldr: This article investigates the factors that affect jump height in various animals, including humans, other vertebrates, and insects. It explores leg design, muscle properties, and jumping techniques, such as countermovement and catapult mechanisms. Mathematical models are used to determine the effects of these factors on jump performance, providing insights into the adaptations that enable animals to jump effectively.
