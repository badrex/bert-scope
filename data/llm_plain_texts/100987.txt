tldr: In 1668, M. Hugens and M. Picart observed Saturn using a 21-foot telescope in Paris. They noticed that the planet's oval-shaped ring system appeared more prominent than in previous years. Their observations led to a more accurate measurement of the ring's inclination, which helped confirm the hypothesis of the ring system. The authors also discussed the expected changes in Saturn's appearance over the coming years.
