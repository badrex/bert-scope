tldr: The authors present a new method for fitting boundary conditions in the cellular method for close-packed hexagonal lattices, specifically applying it to zirconium metal. They develop a technique for dealing with a least squares problem and create a program for a digital computer to carry out the cellular computation automatically. The energy eigenvalues for all 12 irreducible representations of zirconium metal are provided.
