tldr: The authors measured the magnetic moment of the proton by comparing the proton spin resonance frequency with the proton cyclotron frequency in the same magnetic field. They used a modified decelerating cyclotron to interpret the experimental results and found that the magnetic moment of the proton is 2.7928 nuclear magnetons. This discovery is important for evaluating the best values of fundamental atomic constants.
