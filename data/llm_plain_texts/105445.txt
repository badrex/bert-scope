tldr: The author, John Michell, discusses the use of Hadley's quadrant in various applications, including navigation, surveying, and determining a ship's position. He explains how the instrument can be used to take precise measurements and improve the accuracy of observations, even in the challenging conditions of a moving vessel. Michell also suggests using the quadrant in conjunction with charts and geometric principles to determine a ship's location with great precision.
