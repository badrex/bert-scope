tldr: The author discovered that the sponge Merlia normani has a unique infestation of Zooxanthella, which plays a significant role in its exceptional characteristics. The sponge's calcareous skeleton is made up of calcified corpses of these organisms, and the author suggests that this feature is a descendant of the Palaeozoic Monticuliporas. The study also highlights the relationship between Merlia normani and the Monticuliporas species.
