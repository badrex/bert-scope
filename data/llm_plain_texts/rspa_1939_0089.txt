tldr: This article investigates natural convection in liquids, focusing on the heat transfer and fluid dynamics near a heated vertical plate. The author presents three approximate solutions to the problem and compares them with previous experimental data and other theoretical methods. The study provides insights into the behavior of natural convection in various fluids and offers a theoretical framework for understanding heat transfer in similar scenarios.
