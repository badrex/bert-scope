tldr: This article by T. Lauder Brunton and Walter Pye examines the physiological effects of Erythrophleum guinense bark, also known as sassy bark. They found that it reduces oxidation and has varying effects on different organisms, including humans. It causes failure of muscular power, vomiting, and irregular muscular movements in some animals, while in others, it raises blood pressure and slows down the heart rate. The authors also observed unique pulsations in pulmonary veins after the heart has stopped beating.
