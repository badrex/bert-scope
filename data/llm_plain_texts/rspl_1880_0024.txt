tldr: This article investigates the effects of electric currents on the diffusion and electrolysis of liquids. The author examines various pairs of electrolytes, observing complex phenomena involving physical and chemical effects. The study concludes that electric currents can cause electrolysis, dissociation of water from salt, and simple mechanical movement and diffusion of liquid by electric convection. The findings also suggest that every inequality of structure or composition of the liquid in the path of the current acts to some extent as an electrode.
