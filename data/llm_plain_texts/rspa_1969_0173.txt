tldr: The author used a non-local pseudopotential model to generate the Fermi surfaces of CuZn and PdIn alloys, taking into account the influence of d-electrons. The model involved six parameters and provided a satisfactory fit to the de Haas-van Alphen frequencies observed in the alloys. This approach could be applicable to similar situations.
