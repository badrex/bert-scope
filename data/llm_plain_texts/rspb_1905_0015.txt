tldr: The authors investigate the similarities between Plimmer's Bodies, found in cancerous growths, and vesicular structures in reproductive cells. They suggest that these structures may be related, as both are autonomous and exhibit unique cellular and nuclear transformations. This connection could have implications for understanding the development of cancerous cells.
