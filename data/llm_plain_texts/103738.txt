tldr: 'In this article, Lord Paisley describes his observations of a comet he discovered in October 1723. He provides detailed descriptions of the comet's appearance and movement, as well as three figures representing the comet on different nights. The comet's tail gradually decreased in size and brightness over time, making it difficult to observe after a few weeks.'
