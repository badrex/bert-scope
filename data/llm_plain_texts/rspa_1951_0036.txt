tldr: The authors studied the photochemistry of native proteins, focusing on serum albumin and gelatine. They discovered that approximately 5% of the radiation absorbed by the protein at 2537A wavelength is directly absorbed at the keto-imino linkage. Irradiation in nitrogen causes protein aggregation, while irradiation in oxygen leads to photo-oxidative decomposition. The authors also found that absorption of radiation quanta by the keto-imino linkage causes the linkage to break, producing free radicals that react with other protein molecules, forming aggregates. The quantum efficiency for this process was determined in terms of the number of quanta absorbed by the peptide linkage.
