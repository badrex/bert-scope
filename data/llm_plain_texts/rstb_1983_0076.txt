tldr: The authors studied the dissemination of mildew spores in a glasshouse and found that human intervention can significantly affect the spread of plant diseases. They discovered that environmental factors, such as wind and air turbulence, play a crucial role in spore dissemination. The authors also highlighted the importance of understanding the variables responsible for the rate of disease development, including the host, pathogen, and environment, to effectively control and prevent epidemics in glasshouses.
