tldr: 'In 1761, Mr. Abraham Mason reported an extraordinary agitation of the sea in Barbados, similar to an earthquake. This event coincided with a severe health crisis affecting the island, causing widespread illness among the inhabitants. The crisis was particularly puzzling for local pharmacists, who struggled to find the cause and cure. Despite the widespread illness, few deaths were reported. The situation also affected the British Royal Navy, as many sailors were unfit for service due to the contagion.'
