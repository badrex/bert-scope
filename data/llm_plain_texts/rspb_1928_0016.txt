tldr: The authors conducted a series of experiments to determine the organic content of human enamel. They analyzed samples from young and adult human teeth, as well as deciduous teeth, and found that the organic content in enamel is between 1-2%. The study also discussed potential sources of error and methods to avoid them in analyzing enamel samples.
