tldr: The author, Isaac Todhunter, points out an error in Jacobi's extension of a theorem related to the equilibrium of a fluid in the form of an ellipsoid. He demonstrates that the axis of rotation must coincide with one of the principal axes, specifically the least principal axis. He also discusses the work of Dahlander, who incorrectly assumes three simultaneous angular velocities, and corrects the mistake.
