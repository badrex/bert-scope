tldr: This article discusses the concept of torsional oscillations in a rotating star with a poloidal magnetic field. The authors derive numerical estimates for the period of the fundamental mode and explore the implications of these oscillations in relation to solar variability. They also consider different forms of the poloidal magnetic field and use the Rayleigh-Ritz method to estimate the frequency of the lowest mode.
