tldr: This article presents a petrographic survey of rock fragments collected from the Mid-Indian rift zone. The authors identify three main series of magmatic and metamorphic rocks, including dunite-peridotite, fresh tholeiitic basalt, and greenstone (spilite-diabase) associations. They discuss the chemical composition and metamorphic features of these rocks, suggesting that infiltration of volatile fluids from the upper mantle may play a role in their metamorphism.
