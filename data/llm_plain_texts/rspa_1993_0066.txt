tldr: The authors studied the initiation and propagation of deflagration and detonation in various primary explosives, such as mercury fulminate, lead azide, and silver-5-nitrotetrazole. They investigated factors affecting deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) and the related phenomenon of dead-pressing. The research aimed to understand the mechanisms behind DDT and its relationship to the initiation and propagation processes in primary explosives.
