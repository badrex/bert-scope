tldr: This article discusses the study of transcurrent faulting and displacements in the ocean floor, focusing on the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The authors measure the displacements along strike-slip faults using magnetic anomaly patterns and find that the ocean floor carries a pattern of total magnetic intensity anomalies oriented north-south. The study provides evidence for extensive lateral movement in the Earth's upper mantle and suggests that transcurrent movements have occurred due to the extrusion of hot mantle material under oceanic rises.
