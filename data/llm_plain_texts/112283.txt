tldr: 'The author, Alexander J. Ellis, introduces Clinant Geometry as a means to express the general relations of points in a plane, resolve conflicts between algebra and geometry, and extend the theories of anharmonic ratios. Clinants are operations that alter the length of a line in a given ratio and rotate it through a specific angle. This new approach allows for a geometrical representation of algebraic results, eliminating the concept of "imaginary" numbers and discrepancies between analysis and geometry. The author demonstrates the application of Clinant Geometry through various examples, including the stigmatic straight line and central stigmatic circle, which provide a complete geometrical explanation for complex algebraic concepts.'
