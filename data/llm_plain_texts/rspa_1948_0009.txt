tldr: The author calculates the second virial coefficient for non-spherical molecules, specifically those that are roughly cylindrical in shape. They use a four-center molecular model to derive an intermolecular potential and provide tables for the second virial coefficient and Thomson c at low pressures. This work allows for the analysis of observed virial coefficients of gases and provides insights into intermolecular forces between non-spherical molecules at any relative orientation.
