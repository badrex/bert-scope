tldr: The author describes a rare case of a birth defect where a child was born with a small, malformed body lacking a head, brain, spinal cord, and most internal organs. The child had a bony structure resembling a kneeling position and a small intestine connected to the posterior edge of the pelvis. This case study provides insights into the limits of human development and the importance of various organs and structures in the functioning of the human body.
