tldr: The author, W. Snow Harris, investigates the elementary laws of electricity and presents new electrical instruments for studying these laws. He describes an electroscope that acts on the principle of divergence and a moveable conductor suspended over it. These instruments help in measuring attractive and repulsive forces between conductors, providing a deeper understanding of electrical phenomena.
