tldr: The authors analyze the vibration frequencies of triatomic molecules, such as ozone, fluorine monoxide, chlorine monoxide, nitrogen monoxide, and nitrogen trioxide. They propose new assignments for these frequencies that better align with the observed regularities in isoelectronic molecules. The new assignments provide a more accurate interpretation of the molecules' properties and help to understand their behavior in various processes.
