tldr: The author conducted seismometric measurements to study the vibration of the Tay Bridge during the passage of railway trains. The results showed that the bridge experienced both longitudinal and lateral vibrations, with the lateral movements being more significant. The vibrations were caused by the trains passing over the bridge and were recorded using a duplex pendulum seismograph. This study demonstrated a novel method of inquiry that may be useful for engineers in understanding the effects of various disturbances on engineering structures.
