tldr: This article investigates the polymerization and oxidation processes in monolayers of drying oils. The authors found that the reaction is a chain process that can be influenced by factors such as temperature, pressure, and the presence of inhibitors. They also discovered that the polymerization process is sensitive to different wavelengths of light, with short-wave ultra-violet light promoting primary oxidation and long-wave ultra-violet light promoting polymerization.
