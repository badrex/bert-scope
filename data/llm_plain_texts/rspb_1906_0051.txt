tldr: The author investigates the structure of the lumbo-sacral-coccygeal cord of the Macaque monkey using histology techniques and provides measurements of the cross-sections of the cord. The study focuses on the areas of the grey and white substance at different levels of the cord and compares the results with previous research on human spinal cords. The findings contribute to the understanding of the monkey's spinal cord structure and its potential implications for human spinal cord research.
