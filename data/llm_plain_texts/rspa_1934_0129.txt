tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the relationship between the photoelectric properties and structure of certain surfaces by depositing metal vapors on polished and etched metal surfaces. They observed that the diffraction patterns of crystalline deposits disappeared rapidly on polished surfaces but remained permanent on etched surfaces. This provided direct experimental proof of the existence of the Beilby layer and its formation by polishing.
