tldr: This article describes a precise method for measuring the density of mercury at 20°C using a hollow cube of fused silica. The researchers found that the largest source of uncertainty in previous measurements was the thickness of grease films on the surfaces of the cubes. They developed a new method to minimize these uncertainties and obtained a more accurate density value for mercury.
