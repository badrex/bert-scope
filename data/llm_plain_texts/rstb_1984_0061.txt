tldr: This article discusses the effects of acidic aerosol, fog, mist, and rain on crops and trees. It examines the physical and chemical properties of these atmospheric precipitation components and their influence on plant health. The study highlights the importance of meteorological factors, such as wind, humidity, and temperature, in determining the deposition rates and potential impacts on vegetation. The article also explores the chemical composition of acidic precipitation and its potential effects on plant nutrition and processes occurring at the leaf surface-atmosphere interface.
