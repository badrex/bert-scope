tldr: The authors conducted experiments on monkeys to study the functions of the cerebral cortex. They described the methods used, the results of excitation and extirpation of various parts of the cerebral hemispheres, and the symptoms observed during life and after death. The paper also includes a topographical plan of the excitable or motor region of the cortex cerebri.
