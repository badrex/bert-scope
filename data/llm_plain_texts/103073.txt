tldr: The author examines the four grinding teeth of an elephant found in Ireland and provides a detailed analysis of their structure and formation. The author compares the teeth to descriptions by other naturalists and concludes that they are indeed from an elephant. The teeth's unique structure is explained as a result of nature's design for the elephant's diet and long lifespan. The author also discusses the possible reasons for the teeth's preservation and the elephant's presence in Ireland.
