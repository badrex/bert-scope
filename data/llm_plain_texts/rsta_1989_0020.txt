tldr: This study investigates the rapid deformation behavior of various polymers under compression. The research focuses on understanding the effects of strain rate on the mechanical properties of polymers and the role of thermal properties in rapid deformation. The authors used high-speed photography and heat-sensitive film techniques to visualize and measure the deformation process. They found that the strain rate sensitivity of the polymers ranged from 5-15 MPa per decade of strain rate, with some polymers showing softening at higher strain rates.
