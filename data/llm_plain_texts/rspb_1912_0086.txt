tldr: The author studies a camel trypanosome and examines the biometric method of diagnosing trypanosomes. They find that the biometric method has limitations and is not always reliable for diagnosis, as it is affected by factors such as fixation, strain variations, and the age of the strain. The author suggests that measurements should be made in a consistent manner, but the biometric method should not be overemphasized in diagnosing trypanosomes.
