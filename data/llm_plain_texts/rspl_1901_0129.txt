tldr: The author investigated the effects of induced currents on the distribution of magnetism in an iron cylinder when rotated in a magnetic field. They found that the distribution of magnetism varies with the frequency of rotation and the strength of the external magnetic force. The results have wider applications to similar cylinders with different dimensions. The study also compared the effects of rotating and alternating magnetic fields on the iron cylinder.
