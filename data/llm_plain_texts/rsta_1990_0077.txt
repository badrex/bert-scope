tldr: This article examines the environmental impacts of a fast reactor fuel cycle, focusing on the local and global consequences. It compares the environmental effects of a fast reactor with those of thermal reactor fuel cycles, considering factors such as radioactive emissions, radiation doses, and waste management. The study finds that while there are differences in the environmental impacts, the planned discharges from fast reactor fuel reprocessing using current technology are already lower than those of comparable plants today.
