tldr: This article discusses the role of tonalites in the formation and evolution of Earth's continental crust. Tonalites played three significant roles in geological time, contributing to the generation of the Earth's oldest crust, forming part of the greenstone-granite terranes, and composing about 5-10% of the crust generated in Proterozoic and Phanerozoic time at convergent oceanic-continental margins. The article also explores the different stages of crustal evolution and the tectonomagmatic processes involved.
