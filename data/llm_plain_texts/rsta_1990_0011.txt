tldr: This article discusses the importance of high purity organometallic precursors for semiconductor fabrication, particularly for metal-organic vapour phase epitaxy (MOVPE). The authors review adduct purification methods for main-group metal alkyls, which involve forming stable adducts with Lewis bases to remove impurities. They also explore alternative source materials and new results on the synthesis and thermal stability of mixed alkyl compounds of tellurium.
