tldr: The authors conducted a vertex analysis of Purkinje cell dendritic trees in the cerebellum of rats. They found that the mean number of segments in the trees was 881, with segment lengths being longest over proximal segments. The growth of the Purkinje cell tree was most closely simulated by a random terminal growth model, incorporating 5% trichotomy, where branching of higher order terminals was more likely than lower order terminals. This study provides a comprehensive methodology for analyzing branching structures in neural networks.
