revised_title: Vibration-Rotation Bands of Methyl Fluoride and Deuterated Methyl Fluoride
semantic_tags:
  - Molecular spectroscopy
  - Vibration-rotation bands
  - Methyl fluoride
  - Deuterated methyl fluoride
  - Rotational constants
tldr: The authors measured and analyzed the vibration-rotation bands of methyl fluoride and deuterated methyl fluoride, resolving much of their fine structure. They derived values for rotational constants, Coriolis coefficients, and other molecular constants, providing insights into the structure and behavior of these molecules.
