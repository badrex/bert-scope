tldr: This article explores the geochemistry of oceanic ferromanganese deposits, which are important authigenic mineral deposits forming on the deep sea floor. The two types of marine ferromanganese deposits have different chemical compositions and are the products of different precipitation and accretion mechanisms. The article discusses their formation, chemical composition, and the factors influencing their distribution, such as metal sources on the sea floor and environmental conditions.
