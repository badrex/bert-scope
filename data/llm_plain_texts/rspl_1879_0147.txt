tldr: In this article, William Crookes explains his theory of a fourth state of matter, which he calls "radiant matter." He describes how this state is formed through rarefaction and the control of molecular movements. Crookes also discusses the properties of this state and how it differs from the gaseous state. He believes that the molecule is the true matter, and the state we know as matter is just the effect of molecular movements on our senses.
