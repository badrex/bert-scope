tldr: This article presents an experimental study on the latent heat of vaporization of benzene at temperatures above its boiling point. The authors determined the heat required to convert benzene liquid into saturated vapor at various temperatures and found that the latent heat decreases with increasing temperature. The results provide a more accurate understanding of benzene's thermodynamic properties and contribute to the development of molecular theory in the liquid state.
