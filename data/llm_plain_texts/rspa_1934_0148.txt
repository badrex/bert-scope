tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the angular distribution of electrons scattered by acetylene, ethylene, and ethane at various voltages. They found that the form of the scattering curves varied with voltage and molecule shape, with ethylene showing the greatest resemblance to the spherical molecule methane. The results are discussed in relation to molecular field contours and atomic configurations.
