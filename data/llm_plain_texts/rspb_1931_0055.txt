tldr: The author investigates the distribution of sandflies in relation to Mediterranean Kala Azar and concludes that P. perniciosus is the primary carrier of the disease due to its distribution, infection rates after feeding on human cases, and adaptation to the insect vector. The study also highlights the importance of understanding the bionomics of the insect vector, susceptibility of the population, and frequency of parasites in the blood for the epidemiology of the disease.
