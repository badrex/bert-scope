tldr: The author investigates the effectiveness of surface currents in preventing the passage of waves coming from the sea. Two types of currents are considered: one with uniform velocity and another with velocity decreasing uniformly and vanishing at a certain depth. The author also examines the water current produced by a curtain of air bubbles from a perforated tube on the sea bottom, comparing the theoretical predictions with experimental results. The study shows that surface currents can effectively stop waves of a certain critical length when directed against oncoming waves.
