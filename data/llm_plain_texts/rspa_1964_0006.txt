tldr: The authors develop a generalized spin-Hamiltonian formalism to describe the low-lying energy levels of paramagnetic ions in crystals, incorporating all independent spin operators arising from higher multipole effects. They apply this method to cubic crystalline symmetry, providing expressions for the Zeeman field-independent part and the linearly field-dependent part of the spin Hamiltonian for ions with electron spin and nuclear spin up to 2. The study emphasizes the importance of terms quadratic in the Zeeman field for precise ENDOR experiments.
