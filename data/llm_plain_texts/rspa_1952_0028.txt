tldr: The author investigates the spectra of flames supported by fluorine and their emission characteristics. They study the reactions of fluorine with various organic and inorganic substances, observing the emission of C2 and CH bands and the effect of hydrogen on carbon formation and the emission of these bands. The author also discusses the possible mechanisms for carbon and C2 and CH formation in these flames.
