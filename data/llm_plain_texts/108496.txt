  - Heat expansion

  - Isothermal curves
tldr: 'The author, William John Macquorn Rankine, explains the geometrical representation of the expansive action of heat and its application to thermo-dynamic engines. He introduces the concept of isothermal curves and curves of no transmission, and discusses the transformation of heat to motive power through changes in the volume of an elastic substance. Rankine also emphasizes the importance of understanding the total actual heat and the mechanical equivalent of heat in various types of engines.'
