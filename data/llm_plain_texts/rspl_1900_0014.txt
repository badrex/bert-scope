tldr: 'This report presents the results of magnetical observations conducted at Falmouth Observatory in 1897. The observations focused on the Declination and Horizontal Force, which were deduced from hourly readings of photographic curves. The data was collected using specialized equipment and methods, and the findings provide valuable information on the Earth's magnetic field during that time period.'
