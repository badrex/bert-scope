tldr: The authors studied the poisonous effects of the young plants of the Great Millet, Sorghum vulgare, and discovered that the toxicity is due to the presence of a glucoside that undergoes hydrolysis, producing prussic acid. This finding helps clarify the confusion surrounding the poisonous properties of the plant and its effects on cattle. The authors also provide methods for isolating the glucoside responsible for the toxicity.
