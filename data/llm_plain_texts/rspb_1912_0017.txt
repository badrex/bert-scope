tldr: The authors discovered that a trypanosome species, Trypanosoma uniforme, is present in antelopes near Lake Victoria. They found that Glossina palpalis tsetse flies can transmit this species to healthy animals. The study also showed that these flies are naturally infected with Trypanosoma uniforme. This research contributes to understanding the transmission of trypanosomiasis, a disease affecting humans and animals.
