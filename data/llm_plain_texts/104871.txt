tldr: 'This article presents a collection of equations for exhibiting the relationships between goniometrical lines. The author, William Jones, provides a method for calculating the sine, tangent, secant, and versed sine of arcs in a circle. He also explains how to use these equations to find the product of co-sines and the sum of products made of every sine and co-sine. The article also covers the tangent, secant, and co-secant of any arc, as well as the chord of an arc and its relationship to the diameter of the circle.'
