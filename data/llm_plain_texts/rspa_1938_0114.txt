tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the Zeeman and Paschen-Back effects in strong magnetic fields. They used improved techniques to produce and measure magnetic fields up to 320,000 gauss, allowing them to increase the accuracy of their measurements and explain discrepancies found in previous research. The study focused on the behavior of spectral lines and the influence of magnetic fields on the relative intensities of these lines.
