tldr: The author demonstrates that nerves play a crucial role in regulating arterial action and blood distribution in the body. Experiments on animals show that nerve irritation can increase or decrease arterial pulsations, and that heat and cold have different effects on nerve stimulation. This discovery sheds light on various bodily functions, including blood supply regulation, erection, secretions, and the growth of tumors.
