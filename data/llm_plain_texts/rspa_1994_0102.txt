tldr: This article investigates the nonlinear behavior of upper-branch near-neutral waves in pre-stressed incompressible elastic plates. The authors derive an evolution equation for these waves and study its properties, finding that nonlinear effects can either stabilize or destabilize the wave amplitude. The research focuses on a model problem for dispersive waves, considering an incompressible isotropic elastic plate under hydrostatic pressure.
