tldr: This article investigates the diurnal variation of magnetic disturbance in high latitudes and its relation to local and universal time. The study finds that the incidence of irregular magnetic disturbance has a pronounced diurnal variation, with a maximum occurring around the same local time in the evening at various stations. The time of this maximum varies systematically with magnetic latitude, and above 70 degrees, disturbance has its primary maximum in the forenoon, with a secondary maximum in the late evening. The article also examines seasonal changes in the form of the diurnal variation of disturbance, finding that the type of D remains stable at some stations while others show a systematic change in the form of D from winter to summer.
