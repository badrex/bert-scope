tldr: This article discusses the scattering of hard gamma rays and the experimental research conducted to establish the angular distribution of intensity and the variation with wave-length of the probability of interaction between a quantum and an electron. The authors investigate the scattering power of different elements and the absorption coefficient per electron, providing insights into the interaction between gamma rays and matter.
