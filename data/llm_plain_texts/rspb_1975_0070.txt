revised_title: 'Proton Magnetic Resonance Studies of Tyrosine Residues in Hen Lysozyme'
semantic_tags:
  - Protein Structure
  - Magnetic Resonance
  - Amino Acids
  - Lysozyme
  - Conformational Mobility
tldr: The authors used proton magnetic resonance to study the tyrosine residues in hen lysozyme and successfully assigned and detected conformational mobility in the tyrosine rings. They found that the tyrosine residues have considerable conformational mobility, which could have implications for the protein's function and structure.
