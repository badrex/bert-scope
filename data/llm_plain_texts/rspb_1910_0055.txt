tldr: This study examines the anatomy and morphology of the leaves and inflorescences of Welwitschia mirabilis, revealing similarities to Cycads and suggesting connections to the ancestry of Angiosperms. The research also discusses the structure of the ovule, comparing it to other seed plants like Lagenostoma, Cardiocarpus, and Bennettites, and explores the possible primitively foliar origin of the ovules.
