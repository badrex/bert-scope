tldr: This article discusses the effect of asymmetry on the accuracy of wave-length measurements in spectroscopy. The authors present a method to calculate the displacement caused by asymmetry and its impact on resolving power. They also suggest that the assumption of no significant asymmetry in lines might lead to incorrect conclusions in some cases.
