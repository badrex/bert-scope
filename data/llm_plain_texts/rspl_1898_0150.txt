tldr: The author critiques Hertz's wave of magnetic induction theory, arguing that it does not start with zero phase from the origin but with a finite phase. They also discuss the complexity of velocity changes in the wave motion and its relation to Hertz's interference experiments. The authors expand and modify Hertz's theoretical oscillator investigation, providing a new perspective on the topic.
