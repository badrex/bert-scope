tldr: This study investigates the Flandrian biogenic and inorganic deposits of the lower Thames Estuary, focusing on the area between central London and the Isle of Grain. The research deduces the vegetational and environmental history by analyzing pollen, diatom, and other microfossil studies, with radiocarbon dating used to establish an objective chronology. The findings reveal the height of relative sea level movements in marine transgression and regression surfaces, plotted against time to show the rate of relative sea level change and subsidence trends for the Thames Estuary and southern England.
