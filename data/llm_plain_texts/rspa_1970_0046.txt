tldr: The authors measured the photoelectron spectra of chloro-, fluoro-, and chlorofluoroethylenes, determining ionization potentials in the range of 6 to 15 eV. They analyzed the vibrational structure associated with electronic transitions and assigned ionization potentials to specific molecular orbitals. The study discusses variations in ionization potentials related to inductive and conjugative effects of halogen substituents and provides insights into the molecular structure and bonding of halogenated ethylenes.
