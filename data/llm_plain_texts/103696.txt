tldr: In 1725, John Dove reported a surprising discovery of a large shoal of pumice stones floating on the sea during a voyage to India. The pumice stones were found in the South Atlantic Ocean, far from any known land, and were a mystery to the crew. Dove documented the location and extent of the pumice drifts, which were thick and wide, and speculated about their origin. This discovery was significant because no other ships reported similar occurrences, and the pumice stones could pose a danger to ships navigating the area.
