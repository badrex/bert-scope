tldr: The author, Edmund Stone, discovered that the bark of the English willow tree is a powerful astringent and effective in treating ague and intermitting disorders. He found that the bark, when used as a remedy, reduced the severity and frequency of the patients' fits. Stone also compared the willow bark to the Peruvian bark, noting that they have similar properties and can be used together for better results. The willow bark was found to be a safe medicine, with no ill effects reported from its use.
