tldr: The author studied the N-terminal and C-terminal amino acid sequences of calf rennin, a milk-clotting enzyme from the fourth stomach of the calf. They discovered the sequences and found a strong homology with hog pepsin's C-terminal sequence. This research helps understand the structure and function of gastric proteases.
