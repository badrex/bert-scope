tldr: The authors describe the design and synthesis of new enzymes based on the lactate dehydrogenase framework. They analyze the enzyme's structure and mechanism, and use chemical probes and crystal structures to study the protein's movements and substrate recognition. The research successfully predicts the design of new enzymes, such as -hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenase and fully active malate dehydrogenase, and provides insights into enzyme catalysis and protein folding.
