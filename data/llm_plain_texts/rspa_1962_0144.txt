tldr: The authors discuss the localized orbitals needed to describe the properties of an aromatic molecule in the presence of a magnetic field. They calculate the ring currents induced by an external field and their effects on the diamagnetic anisotropy and the shielding of the nuclear dipole of an attached proton. The theory is based on the self-consistent form of molecular orbital theory and is applied to some hydrocarbon molecules.
