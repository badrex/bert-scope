tldr: The authors conducted an experiment to measure the velocity of white and colored light using a revolving toothed wheel and two distant reflectors. They found that blue light travels faster than red light, with a difference in velocity of about 1.8% of the whole velocity. This research supported previous findings on the velocity of light by M. Cornu and Mr. Michelson.
