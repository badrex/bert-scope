tldr: The author, E. Schunck, describes a process to isolate a crystalline fatty acid from human urine. The fatty acid has properties similar to palmitic and stearic acids and is soluble in alcohol and ether. The author discusses the chemical reactions and properties of the fatty acid, but does not determine if it is a normal constituent of healthy urine or how it dissolves in the acidic urine.
