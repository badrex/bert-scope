tldr: The authors developed a semi-empirical SCF treatment for conjugated hydrocarbons, which predicts heats of formation and geometries with good accuracy. They used the Mulliken approximation to estimate core resonance integrals and included non-bonded interactions in their calculations. The study focused on bond properties, heats of atomization, resonance energies, and ionization potentials of various conjugated hydrocarbons.
