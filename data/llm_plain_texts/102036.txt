tldr: The author, Martin Lyster, presents evidence supporting the idea that thunder and lightning are derived from pyrites. He discusses instances of iron falling from the sky and the magnetic properties of lightning, which he believes supports his theory. Lyster argues that the affinity between copper and iron strengthens the likelihood of his hypothesis.
