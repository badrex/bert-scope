tldr: This article discusses the importance of pore fluids in various in situ phenomena related to faulting processes in the Earth's crust. The authors present evidence from measurements of water levels, pore pressure changes, and changes in travel times of seismic waves to support their claims. They argue that the flow of groundwater can provide the necessary viscous element to produce aftershock sequences and that changes in pore pressure can significantly affect local seismicity.
