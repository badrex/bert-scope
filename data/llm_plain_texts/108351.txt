revised_title: 'The Effect of Alcohol Concentration on Specific Gravity in Spirits'
semantic_tags:
  - Alcohol concentration
  - Specific gravity
  - Distillation
  - Fermentation
  - Alcohol purity
tldr: The author conducted experiments to create a table of the quantity of absolute alcohol in spirits of different specific gravities. They found that the actual specific gravities of alcohol and water mixtures form an irregular curve, while the calculated mean specific gravities form a straight diagonal line. This table can be useful in inquiries related to fermentation and other purposes.
