tldr: This paper investigates the precession of a viscous spheroid, using the Earth as an example, and explores the effects of external disturbing bodies like the moon and the sun on the Earth's rotation and obliquity. The author also examines the reaction of the bodily tides on these disturbing bodies and their impact on the moon's distance and periodic time.
