tldr: This article discusses various methods for measuring the temperature of flames, focusing on the wire method and spectral line reversal method. The wire method involves immersing a metal wire carrying electric current in a flame and observing the point at which the current and temperature are equal in both the flame and a vacuum, determining the flame temperature. The spectral line reversal method uses the principle that the dark lines in a solar spectrum correspond to the bright lines in a flame. By observing the disappearance and reversal of spectral lines, the flame temperature can be determined.
