tldr: This article explores the role of inositol lipids and transmembrane signaling in muscle contraction, specifically focusing on inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and calcium. The study identifies the sarcoplasmic reticulum as the primary source of calcium in both smooth and striated muscle, and suggests that IP3 plays a significant role in pharmacomechanical coupling in smooth muscle cells.
