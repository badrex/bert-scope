tldr: The authors studied the thermal decomposition of diethyl ether and found that acetaldehyde is an intermediate product in the reaction. They discovered that the rate of decomposition of acetaldehyde is faster than that of ether, and the reaction can be regarded as a one-stage decomposition of the ether. The authors also found that there is a surface reaction occurring alongside the main reaction, and they provided a detailed analysis of the products formed during the decomposition process.
