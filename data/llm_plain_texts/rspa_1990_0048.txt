tldr: 'This study investigates the structure of boric oxide and alkali borate glasses using high-resolution magic-angle-spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The researchers found that around 66% of boron atoms in boric oxide glass are present in boroxol units, while the rest are in loose B03/2 units. The study also reveals that the remarkable tendency of boric oxide to vitrify may have a structural origin.'
