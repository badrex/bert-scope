tldr: The author compares various British standards of linear measure, including the forty-inch bar, General Roy's scale, and Sir George Shuckburgh's scale, to determine their accuracy and establish a standard for future use in trigonometrical surveys. The author finds that the forty-inch bar is shorter than one sixth of Ramsden's bar, and that General Roy's scale is shorter than the forty-inch bar by 0.1732 inches. The study aims to improve the precision of measurements and establish a reliable standard for future scientific work.
