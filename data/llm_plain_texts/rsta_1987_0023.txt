tldr: The article discusses the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the white-rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium during lignin degradation. The fungus produces H2O2 through enzymes like glucose-2-oxidase and methanol oxidase, which play a crucial role in breaking down lignin. The fungus also regulates glucose levels in its environment to control H2O2 production and maintain its ability to degrade lignin.
