tldr: The authors studied the vibrational relaxation of nitric oxide and carbon monoxide using kinetic spectroscopy. They found that the relaxation of nitric oxide is slightly faster in nitrogen than in helium or krypton. Additionally, they discovered that flashing mixtures of nitric oxide and carbon monoxide causes the carbon monoxide to become vibrationally excited, which accounts for the fast relaxation of nitric oxide in these mixtures.
