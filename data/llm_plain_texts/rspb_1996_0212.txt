tldr: The authors studied the relationship between nuclear DNA content and floral evolution in the plant Silene latifolia. They found a negative correlation between DNA content and calyx diameter, suggesting that repetitive DNA may play a role in phenotypic variation and evolution. This discovery could help understand the genetic basis of flower size and its ecological significance in plants.
