tldr: In 1769, Samuel Horsley observed the transit of Venus on the Sun using a 18-inch reflector telescope. He recorded the external and internal contact times of the event and compared them with other observers. The observations helped in understanding the accuracy of timekeeping and telescope technology at the time.
