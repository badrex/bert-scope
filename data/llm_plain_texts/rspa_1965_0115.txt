tldr: The authors investigated the ground state of divalent thulium in calcium fluoride using electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopy. They measured the hyperfine interactions of the ion with the four nearest fluorine shells and analyzed the crystal field states. This study provides insights into the bonding and electronic structure of the complex.
