tldr: This article presents a numerical approach to study free tidal oscillations in a rotating square sea. The authors use a relaxation method to solve the dynamical equations and obtain a series of solutions for different degrees of rotation. The study provides insights into the behavior of tides in seas and oceans on Earth and has implications for understanding ocean currents and water movement.
