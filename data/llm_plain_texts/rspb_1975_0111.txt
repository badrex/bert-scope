tldr: The article discusses the importance of membrane separation processes and freeze concentration in food technology during the 1980s. It highlights the need for increased flexibility in materials and processes due to potential shortages in raw materials and energy resources. The author also emphasizes the significance of concentration and separation processes in food production from new sources, such as waste streams and single-cell organisms. Freeze concentration has a great potential in food and pharmaceutical products that require mild treatment and maximum preservation of flavor qualities. Membrane separation and concentration, along with other complex food production schemes using membranes, will become increasingly important in the future.
