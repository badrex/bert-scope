tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of high temperatures on the anti-neuritic vitamine, which causes polyneuritis in birds and beri-beri in humans. They found that the vitamine is slowly destroyed at 100°C and rapidly destroyed at temperatures above 120°C. This is important for understanding the nutritional value of cooked foods and preserved foods, such as tinned meat and vegetables.
