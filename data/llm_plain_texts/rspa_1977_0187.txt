tldr: The authors analyze spin-weighted spheroidal harmonics, which are used to study scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational wave perturbations of Kerr black holes. They explore the behavior of these harmonics and their eigenvalues for small and large frequencies, providing useful analytical expressions for specific astrophysical situations involving rotating black holes and radiation.
