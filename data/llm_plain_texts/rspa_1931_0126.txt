tldr: The author investigates the tidal oscillations in a rectangular basin, providing a mathematical analysis of wave motion. They find that there is more than a single normal mode of oscillation and that the waves move in opposite directions. The study helps to understand the behavior of waves in water bodies and can be applied to improve the understanding of ocean tides and water management.
