tldr: This article discusses the molecular aspects of neurohypophysial hormone release, focusing on the role of neurophysin and the interaction between hormones and calcium ions. The authors propose that calcium ions may affect hormone release by inhibiting the formation of complexes between hormones and neurophysin, and by promoting extracellular extrusion of hormone-containing particles (exocytosis). The article also highlights the importance of understanding the relationship between hormone release and the ultrastructure of nerve terminals in stimulated neurohypophyses.
