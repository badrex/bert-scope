tldr: The article describes the unique tapetum lucidum found in the eyes of seatrout (Sciaenidae) fish. This tapetum is a lipid-based, diffusely reflecting layer located in the pigment epithelial cells. The reflecting material is composed of small spheres with a diameter of about 0.4 Âµm, which scatter light to enhance night vision. The lipid material is mainly composed of triglycerides and a specific fatty acid, tridocosahexaenoin. This tapetum is different from other known tapeta in its location and properties, and its presence may help seatrout adapt to low-light conditions in turbid inshore waters.
