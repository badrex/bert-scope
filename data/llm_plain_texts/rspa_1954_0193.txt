tldr: The authors conducted magnetothermal measurements on manganese ferrite and magnesium zinc ferrite to study their spontaneous magnetization. They used three extrapolation techniques to determine the spontaneous magnetization and found that the results agreed with Neel's theory of ferrimagnetism. The study also investigated the behavior of the materials in the Curie point region and their magnetization properties.
