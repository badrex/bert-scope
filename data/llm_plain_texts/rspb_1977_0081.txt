tldr: The authors discovered interplexiform cells in the rabbit retina using Golgi staining methods. These cells have different morphologies and are present in significant numbers. Interplexiform cells provide connections between the inner and outer plexiform layers, suggesting they could control the flow of information within the retina. The presence of these cells in the rabbit retina adds to the understanding of neural mechanisms and retinal information processing.
