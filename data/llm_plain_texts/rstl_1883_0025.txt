tldr: The author investigates the continuity of protoplasm in plant cells and demonstrates that protoplasmic threads pass through pits in the cell walls. They also discuss various preservation techniques for studying plant cells, finding that a saturated watery solution of picric acid provides the best results. This research supports the idea that plant cells are fundamentally a protoplasmic body connected by these threads.
