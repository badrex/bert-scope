tldr: This article discusses the discovery of a bacterium found in association with yeast, which can ferment sugar to produce carbon dioxide and some acid, creating a drink similar to lemonade or ginger-beer. The bacterium and yeast can grow in anaerobic conditions and are responsible for the fermentation process. The authors also describe the process of isolating and separating the two organisms for further study.
