tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the slow combustion of cyclopropane and analyzed the products and intermediates formed during the reaction. They discovered that the stable products were carbon monoxide, water, and small amounts of carbon dioxide, methane, and hydrogen. The only organic intermediate was formaldehyde, which played a crucial role in the delayed branching of the reaction. A detailed reaction scheme is proposed, involving the production and decomposition of cyclopropylperoxyl radicals and the involvement of OH and HOâ€¢ radicals in the reaction chains.
