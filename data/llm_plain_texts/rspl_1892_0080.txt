tldr: The author conducted experiments on frogs, cats, and monkeys to study the distribution of fibres in the posterior roots of spinal nerves. They discovered that each sensory spinal root has a specific segmental skin-field, and these fields overlap with neighboring fields. The author also found that the cutaneous segments in the limbs are distorted and seemingly dislocated from their attachments to the mid-dorsal and mid-ventral lines of the trunk. This study provides insights into the segmental significance of the constitution of sensory spinal roots and their relationship with the skin fields.
