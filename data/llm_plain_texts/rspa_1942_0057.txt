tldr: This article discusses the nuclear two-body problem, focusing on non-central forces between particles. The authors analyze the effects of these forces on the deuteron's properties, such as binding energy and electric quadripole moment. They find that the results obtained with central forces can be applied to non-central forces with only minor modifications.
