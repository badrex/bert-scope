revised_title: 'Unifying Wave Mechanics and Relativity Theory through Metrics of Space'
semantic_tags:
  - Wave mechanics
  - Relativity theory
  - Metrics of space
  - Electromagnetic phenomena
  - Quantum theory
tldr: The authors propose a union between classical and quantum theory by introducing a law of metrics in space-time. They derive an equation identical in form to the wave equation, suggesting that this law of metrics is essential for understanding the relationship between gravitational and electromagnetic phenomena.
