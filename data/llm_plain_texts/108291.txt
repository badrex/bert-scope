tldr: The author conducted a series of experiments to analyze the chemical nature of wax, specifically beeswax. They discovered that beeswax contains two main components, cerin and myricin, which can be separated using alcohol. The author also found that cerin can be further broken down into an unsaponifiable body called cerain and an acid. This research sheds light on the formation of fatty bodies and the transformation of sugar into wax in bees, which could have implications for understanding animal structure repair and the production of other waxes.
