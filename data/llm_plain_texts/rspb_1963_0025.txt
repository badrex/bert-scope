tldr: The author examines unique attachment and interaction mechanisms between the Loranthaceae plant parasites and their hosts in Australia. They describe various attachment structures, such as longitudinal strands and tangential flanges, and discuss the growth and development of these structures in different host species. The study provides insights into the complex relationships between parasites and their hosts and the strategies they employ to survive and thrive.
