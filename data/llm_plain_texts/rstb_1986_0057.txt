tldr: This article discusses the regulation of plant gene expression during growth and development. It highlights the highly regulated expression of genes in different organ systems and the unique regulation of seed protein genes during embryonic development. The study also explores the roles of transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes in controlling plant gene expression.
