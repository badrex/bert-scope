tldr: The authors studied the van der Waals forces in oil-water systems by examining thin lipid films. They measured the contact angle and estimated the van der Waals free energy of film thinning. Their findings suggest that the main contribution to the free energy change during film formation comes from van der Waals forces, with other forces like electrostatic repulsion being negligible. This research provides insights into the interaction of macroscopic bodies at small separations and the role of van der Waals forces in oil-water systems.
