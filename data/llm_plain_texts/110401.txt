tldr: William Rowan Hamilton introduced a general method in dynamics that simplifies the study of free systems of attracting or repelling points. This method reduces the study to finding and differentiating a central relation or characteristic function. This approach revolutionized the understanding of classical mechanics and laid the foundation for modern Hamiltonian mechanics.
