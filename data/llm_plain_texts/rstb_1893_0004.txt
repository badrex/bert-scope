tldr: The author investigates the electromotive properties of the skin of the common eel, focusing on the role of glandular secretions in the generation of the current of rest. They demonstrate that the current of rest in eels is associated with active preparatory processes in their glandular elements, rather than a demarcation surface. The study provides insights into the physiology and biology of eels and contributes to the understanding of skin electromotive properties in fish.
