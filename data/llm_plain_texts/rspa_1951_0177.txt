tldr: This article investigates the stability of viscous flow between parallel planes for finite disturbances. The authors find that the critical Reynolds number depends on the magnitude of the disturbances and that periodic vibrations of finite amplitude can exist in the flow, maintaining laminar flow. They provide a method for calculating the critical parameters and discuss the modified mean flow profile.
