tldr: The author, A. W. Hofmann, discovered a new class of diatomic bodies called phosphammonium-compounds. These compounds are formed by the reaction of phosphorus and nitrogen-based molecules. The author established the transformation of monatomic into diatomic compounds and demonstrated the diatomic nature of these new compounds through various experiments and reactions.
