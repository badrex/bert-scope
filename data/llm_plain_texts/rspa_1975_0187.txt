tldr: The authors study irreversible processes in a model universe containing gas and radiation, exploring the effects of these processes on the dynamical behavior and entropy of the model. They find that the entropy increases continuously, providing an arrow of time even in the contracting phase, and that the dynamical behavior changes systematically from cycle to cycle, resembling a system that is just barely bound. The study uses simplified hypotheses regarding the exchange of energy between gas and radiation, and provides insights into thermodynamic properties expected in more realistic models.
