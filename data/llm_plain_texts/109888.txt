tldr: The author, Everard Home, examines the glandular structure and mucus secretion in the nests of the Java Swallow. He discovers that the nests are made from a unique mucus secreted by the bird's stomach glands. The chemical composition of the nest is similar to albumen but has distinct properties. This research confirms that membranes without visible glandular structures can still secrete mucus.
