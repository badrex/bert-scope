tldr: The authors discovered that the haemocytes of the American horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus) synthesize nitric oxide from L-arginine using nitric oxide synthase. This finding indicates that the formation of nitric oxide from L-arginine is a pathway of early evolutionary origin and suggests that nitric oxide may play a role in regulating the haemostatic function of haemocytes, similar to human platelets.
