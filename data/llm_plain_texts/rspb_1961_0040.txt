tldr: This study investigates arterial air embolism, a serious hazard in diving and submarine escape training, caused by rapid decompression from high atmospheric pressures. The authors found that manual chest squeezing and abdominal binders can effectively prevent injuries like air embolism, pneumothorax, and interstitial emphysema in rabbits during decompression. These findings suggest practical methods to improve safety in diving and related activities.
