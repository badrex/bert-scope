tldr: The author presents a new method for determining the specific heat of solid bodies, which is more accessible and efficient than previous methods. By immersing a glass container with the substance in cold water, the total increase of temperature can be measured, and the specific heat can be calculated. This method allows for smaller quantities of the solid substance and lower temperatures, making it more suitable for various applications in chemistry.
