tldr: The author explores the application of quaternions to rotations in hyperbolic space of four dimensions. They discuss the properties of different types of rotations, including planar rotations in reciprocal planes and a second type of transformation with some properties similar to rotations. The study provides insights into the structure and behavior of hyperbolic space and its applications in special relativity.
