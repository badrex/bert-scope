tldr: The author, John Hunter, examines the similarities and differences between wolves, jackals, and dogs, and investigates the possibility of their classification as the same species. Through observations and experiments, he explores the breeding and behavior of these animals, including the first recorded instance of a dog and wolf breeding in the late 18th century. Hunter's findings contribute to the understanding of animal taxonomy and species classification.
