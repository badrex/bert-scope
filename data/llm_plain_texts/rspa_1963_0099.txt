tldr: The authors studied the magnetic susceptibilities of palladium and palladium-rhodium alloys, observing rapid increases at low temperatures. They attributed these increases to impurities and suggested that they cause a form of superparamagnetism. By combining their results with measurements of electronic contributions to specific heat, they deduced the variation of Stoner's exchange parameter with composition, which has implications for understanding the electronic structure of these materials.
