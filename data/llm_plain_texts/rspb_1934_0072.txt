tldr: Researchers A. W. Greenwood and J. S. S. Blyth developed the capon test to diagnose equine pregnancy by observing changes in the breast feathers of castrated male fowls after injecting them with urine samples from potential pregnant mares. The test is sensitive and accurate, offering a faster alternative to the traditional mouse test. The capon test detects the presence of oestrin in the mare's urine, which is excreted in higher amounts during pregnancy.
