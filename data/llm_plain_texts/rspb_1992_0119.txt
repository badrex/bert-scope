tldr: Termites solve the carbon-nitrogen balance problem by utilizing symbiotic relationships with microorganisms and fungi. These symbiotic mechanisms allow termites to add nitrogen to their food or selectively eliminate carbon, enabling them to efficiently utilize the abundant but carbon-nitrogen unbalanced resources of dead plant matter. This balance constraint also provides an ecological advantage for termites, allowing them to monopolize their food resources.
