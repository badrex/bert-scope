tldr: This article explores the directional distribution of magneto-hydrodynamic waves and other anisotropic wave motions. It examines the effects of compressibility and the use of a more realistic equation for current in a plasma on these waves. The study provides a quantitative measure of the departure from pure one-dimensional propagation and has implications for understanding wave behavior in astrophysical contexts.
