tldr: The authors studied the molecular statistics of enzyme action, specifically focusing on catalase, an enzyme found in living cells. They found that a large proportion of catalase molecules are active at any given moment, leading to a low temperature coefficient. The study provides insights into enzyme kinetics and the efficiency of collisions in enzyme reactions.
