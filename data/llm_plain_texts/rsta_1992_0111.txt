tldr: The authors evaluate the Taylor-type model for large deformation polycrystalline plasticity in FCC metals, comparing predictions for the evolution of crystallographic texture and stress-strain response in various deformation modes against experiments and finite element simulations. The study focuses on OFHC copper and provides insights into the performance of the model in capturing the anisotropic plastic response of polycrystalline metals.
