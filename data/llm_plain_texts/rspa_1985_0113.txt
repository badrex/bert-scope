revised_title: Oxidation Mechanisms in Sliding Wear of Metals
semantic_tags:
  - Oxidative wear
  - Metal oxidation
  - Sliding wear
  - Surface oxidation
  - Wear protection
tldr: This article investigates the various mechanisms of oxide generation during the sliding wear of metals in oxidizing environments. It discusses three main causes of oxide generation: oxidation-scrape-reoxidation, total oxide, and metal debris mechanisms. The authors present theoretical models to account for these processes and assess their importance in wear processes under specific sliding conditions.
