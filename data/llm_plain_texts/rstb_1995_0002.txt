tldr: The article discusses the role of RecA protein in homologous recognition via non-Watson-Crick bonds in base triplets. The protein forms a helical nucleoprotein filament on single-stranded DNA, recognizing homology in duplex DNA and initiating the exchange of strands in homologous recombination. The discovery of this reaction has led to a better understanding of the importance of RecA protein in recombination and repair processes in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
