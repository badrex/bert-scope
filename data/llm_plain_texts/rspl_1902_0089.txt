tldr: The author analyzed the spectra of the solar eclipse of 1900 and confirmed previous findings about the relationship between dark and bright lines in the solar spectrum. They proposed a model of continuous circulation of solar gases in a radial direction, which explains the enhanced lines in the flash spectrum. This model suggests that the chromosphere consists of small eruptions of highly-heated gases, and the flash spectrum represents the emission of both ascending and descending gases, while the Fraunhofer spectrum represents the absorption of descending gases only.
