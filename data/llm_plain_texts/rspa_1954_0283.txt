revised_title: 'Magnetic Properties of Non-Stoichiometric Compounds: Antiferromagnetism and Ferrimagnetism'
semantic_tags:
  - Antiferromagnetism
  - Ferrimagnetism
  - Non-stoichiometric compounds
  - Magnetic properties
  - Crystallography
tldr: The authors study the magnetic properties of non-stoichiometric compounds, specifically antiferromagnetism and ferrimagnetism. They develop a theoretical treatment to understand the behavior of substances containing vacancies and discuss the experimental results for compounds like iron and chromium sulfides, selenides, and tellurides.
