tldr: The article discusses Mr. Spottiswoode's contact problems, focusing on the contact of conics with surfaces and the contact of quadric surfaces with surfaces of higher order. The author presents methods to determine the number of points at which a conic or quadric can have contact with a given surface and applies these methods to various geometric problems.
