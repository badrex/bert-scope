tldr: The author investigates the seed-fungus of Lolium temulentum, the darnel, and its relationship to the plant's toxicity. They discover a layer of fungus hyphae in the seed, which is always situated in a specific layer of the seed, just outside the aleurone layer of the endosperm. The author finds that the fungus is present in the young ovary before fertilization and grows alongside the plant during germination. The presence of the hyphal layer in the darnel grains indicates a case of symbiosis rather than true parasitism.
