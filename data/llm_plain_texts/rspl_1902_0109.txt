tldr: The author conducted experiments to test the statolith theory of geotropism, which suggests that the presence of heavy particles called statoliths in plant cells helps them sense gravity. They found that applying vibration to seedlings increased their geotropic response, supporting the statolith theory. However, they also noted some limitations and sources of error in their experiments.
