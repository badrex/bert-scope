tldr: This article presents a mathematical model that suggests sexual reproduction offers advantages over asexual reproduction when beneficial mutations arise in a population undergoing frequency-dependent selection. In sexual populations, beneficial mutations are less likely to be lost due to genetic drift, allowing for better adaptation and evolution.
