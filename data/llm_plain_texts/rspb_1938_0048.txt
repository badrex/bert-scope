tldr: This study investigates subthreshold potentials in crustacean nerve fibers, providing evidence of localized action potentials in the cathodic part of the nerve fiber. The experiments reveal that a small and localized response can occur in the stimulated region, which may explain previous observations inconsistent with classical theories of excitation.
