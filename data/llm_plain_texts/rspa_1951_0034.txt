  - Equivalent Orbitals
tldr: The authors apply the molecular orbital theory of chemical valency to describe the structure of various molecules, such as methane, ammonia, water, and ethylene, using equivalent orbitals. This method provides a dualistic approach to understanding molecular structure and helps explain properties of chemical interest, such as lone pairs of electrons and double bonds.
