tldr: This article reviews the life and work of the renowned Indian physicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, focusing on his groundbreaking contributions to the field of theoretical astrophysics. Chandrasekhar is best known for his discovery of the 'Chandrasekhar Limit,' which established an upper limit to the mass of a star that could collapse into a white dwarf state. The article highlights his influential research in stellar structure, dynamics, radiative transfer, and hydrodynamic stability, as well as his career at the University of Chicago and his receipt of the Nobel Prize in 1983. It also discusses the impact of his work on the broader scientific community and his personal life, including his upbringing in India and his later years in the United States.
