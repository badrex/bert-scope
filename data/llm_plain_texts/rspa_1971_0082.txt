tldr: The authors conducted experiments and calculations to determine the fundamental vibrational frequencies of electrified water drops and drops in an electric field. They found that the fundamental frequency of a charged drop is zero when the charge equals the Rayleigh critical value, and for higher charges, the frequency is imaginary, indicating instability. The fundamental frequency of an uncharged drop in a uniform electric field decreases with increasing field strength and equals zero when the field reaches a critical value.
