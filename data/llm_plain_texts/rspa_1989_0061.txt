tldr: The authors discovered a static axisymmetric solution of the Einstein-Maxwell equations representing two charged black holes of equal mass and opposite charge connected by'strings'. The space-time outside the black holes' event horizons is asymptotically flat and smooth, except for a conical singularity along the axis where the string is located. Inside the event horizons, time-like curvature singularities occur. This solution allows for the transgression of theorems excluding multiple black holes and isolated charged black holes, made possible by allowing conical singularities.
