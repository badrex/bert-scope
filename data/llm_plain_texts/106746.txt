tldr: In 1785, James Anderson and his team embarked on an expedition to explore Morne Garou, a volcanic mountain on the island of St. Vincent. They faced numerous challenges, including difficult terrain, thick forests, and a lack of clear paths. Despite these obstacles, they managed to reach the mountain's summit and gather valuable information about its geological features and history of volcanic eruptions.
