tldr: The authors conducted seismic refraction shooting experiments in the eastern Atlantic Ocean to study the structure of the ocean floor. They found that basaltic rocks lie immediately below the sedimentary layer, with a mean thickness of about 1 km. The results from the continental shelf confirmed the gentle slope of the basement rocks seaward. The study provides valuable information about the ocean floor structure and contributes to our understanding of the Earth's crust.
