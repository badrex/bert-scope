tldr: 'This article explores the phenomenon of electro-osmosis in Nitella, a type of plant cell. The author examines the properties of the cell membrane, including its hydraulic permeability, diffusional permeability, and conductance. The study suggests that the membrane is a composite structure consisting of a cellulose wall and a lipid lining, and that electro-osmosis occurs when an electric potential is maintained across the membrane. The findings provide insights into the structure and function of plant cell membranes and the role of electro-osmosis in their behavior.'
