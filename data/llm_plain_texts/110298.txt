tldr: The author, William Ritchie, presents experimental research that challenges Volta's theory of galvanic electricity. He demonstrates that contact of dissimilar metals is not necessary for producing galvanic action and that voltaic and common electricity have distinct differences. Ritchie also investigates the fundamental principles and laws of action of the voltaic battery, finding that the voltaic energies of two batteries are proportional to the square root of the number of plates. Lastly, he explores the effects of temperature and the behavior of voltaic electricity in various materials.
