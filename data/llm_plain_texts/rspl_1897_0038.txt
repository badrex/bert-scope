tldr: This article presents an experimental study and theoretical analysis of heat transmission between metal surfaces and liquids. The authors investigate the rate of heat transfer from heated metal surfaces to colder water and vice versa. They propose a method to measure the heat transfer rate and discuss the factors affecting it, such as the velocity of water flow and the thickness of the water film on the metal surface. The results are in accordance with Professor Osborne Reynolds' theory of heat convection.
