tldr: The author, Carlo Matteucci, investigates the electro-physiological phenomena of muscular contraction and the production of electricity in animals. He studies the conductibility of nerves and muscles, concluding that nerves do not conduct electricity as well as muscles. He also explores the influence of the nervous system on the excitability of nerves and the relationship between the direction of an electric current and the modification of nerve excitability.
