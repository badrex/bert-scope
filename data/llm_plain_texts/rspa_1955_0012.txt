tldr: The authors apply the revised valence-bond theory to calculate the lower electron levels of cyclobutadiene and benzene. They demonstrate the practical feasibility of the method and compare the predictions and merits of molecular orbital and valence bond theories. The study supports the view that non-empirical calculations can be extended to systems involving more than a few electrons.
