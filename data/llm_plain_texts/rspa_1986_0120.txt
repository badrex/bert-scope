tldr: The authors analyzed recent values of improved accuracy of the apparent secular accelerations of the Moon and Sun, and used the lunar and solar tidal couples to determine the moment of inertia of the Earth. They found that the moment of inertia has been diminishing at an average rate during the past 3300 years, leading to a non-tidal angular acceleration in addition to the lunar and solar couples. This discovery has implications for understanding the Earth's rotation and its historical changes.
