tldr: The author provides a coherent and self-contained account of the equations governing the perturbations of the Schwarzschild black hole, focusing on the relations between the equations of Bardeen & Press, Zerilli, and Regge & Wheeler. The study helps to understand the behavior of black holes and their perturbations, which is essential for the development of theories related to astrophysics and gravitational waves.
