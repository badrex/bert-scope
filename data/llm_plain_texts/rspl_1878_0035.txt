tldr: The author critiques Professor Haughton's method of estimating geological time by examining the effects of sudden continental elevation on the Earth's axis. He argues that the method is flawed and that smaller impulses at short intervals can potentially increase the radius of the "wobble" instead of reducing it, which is contrary to Haughton's assumption. The author concludes that Haughton's estimate of time is not reliable for determining the history of the Earth.
