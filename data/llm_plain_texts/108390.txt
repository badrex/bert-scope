tldr: 'In this article, Michael Faraday conducts experiments to study the interaction between electricity and magnetism. He uses a helix and a voltaic pair to observe the effects of magnetic fields on a dipping-needle. Faraday discovers that the helix can alter the needle's declination and inclination, demonstrating the influence of electricity on magnetism. This research contributes to the understanding of electromagnetic induction and the behavior of diamagnetic and paramagnetic materials.'
