revised_title: 'Silica Deposition in Carboniferous Chert and the Sponge Theory'

tldr: The author discusses the formation of chert in the Carboniferous Limestone and challenges the theory that it was derived from sponge spicules. Instead, he proposes that the silica was deposited directly from ocean waters, replacing the original limestone. This theory is supported by independent observations from Ireland and Belgium, as well as the author's own research in Western Australia.
