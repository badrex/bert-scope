tldr: The author presents an asymptotic analysis of the magnetic induction equation for large magnetic Reynolds number dynamos, considering different mechanisms for creating magnetic fields. The study focuses on the -effect and its role in dynamo action, with implications for geomagnetic and stellar dynamos. The analysis combines Eulerian and Lagrange coordinates and provides insights into the creation of magnetic fields in turbulent motions.
