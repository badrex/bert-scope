tldr: The author's research explores how the visual system can separate figures from the ground using temporal information, specifically phase differences between groups of spatially homogeneous points. The study found that normal observers can clearly distinguish figure and ground based on temporal factors, with delays as short as 5 milliseconds. This discovery has implications for theories on temporal binding and object recognition.
