tldr: The author investigates the cellular individuality in higher animals, specifically focusing on the red blood corpuscles. They create an inbred strain of fowls with closely similar red blood cells and examine the serological differences between the cells of male and female fowls. The results show that it is possible to produce a strain of birds with almost indistinguishable red blood cells and that no significant serological differences were found between the cells of male and female fowls.
