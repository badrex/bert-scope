  - Supersonic flow

tldr: This article reviews the structure of turbulent boundary layers in supersonic flow, discussing the physical mechanisms that differentiate incompressible and compressible boundary layers. It presents a simple model for the Mach and Reynolds number dependence of the decay of large-scale motions and explores the effects of compressibility and fluid property variations on the boundary layer. The article also examines the role of pressure fluctuations and the dynamics of hairpin structures in high Reynolds number turbulence.
