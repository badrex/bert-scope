tldr: This article explores the evolution of correlated characters in natural populations, focusing on age-structured populations and the effects of directional selection. The author develops a theory of quantitative genetics to predict the short-term evolutionary dynamics of these populations, with applications to the study of fish stocks and their exploitation by humans.
