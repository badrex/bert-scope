tldr: The authors conducted a new measurement of the speed of light using a stabilized laser. They measured the frequency and wavelength of the laser radiation and determined the speed of light in vacuum. This result is in agreement with the internationally recommended value at the time. The measurement technique involved using an upconversion method of optical mixing in a nonlinear crystal, which allowed for wavelength comparisons involving only visible radiations.
