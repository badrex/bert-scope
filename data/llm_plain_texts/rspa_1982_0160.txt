tldr: The authors investigate the behavior of a flux of gravitational and electromagnetic radiation crossing the event horizon of a Reissner-Nordstrom black hole. They demonstrate that the flux of radiation received by an observer crossing the Cauchy horizon diverges for all reasonable perturbations crossing the event horizon, even including those with compact support.
