tldr: This paper presents a quantum mechanical analysis of the Faraday effect in semiconductors. The authors develop general formulae for the dielectric constant tensor and apply them to different types of transitions in semiconductors, including allowed and forbidden direct transitions, indirect transitions, and electrons bound in donor states. The study provides a foundation for understanding the Faraday effect and its applications in semiconductors.
