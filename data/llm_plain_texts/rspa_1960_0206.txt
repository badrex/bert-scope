tldr: The authors used spectroscopic techniques to study the infra-red chemiluminescence of hydrogen chloride (HCl) molecules. They evaluated the vibration-rotation interaction factor (Î³) and the dipole moment function, which helped in determining radiative transition probabilities. The results support earlier findings and provide insights into the behavior of molecules with similar properties.
