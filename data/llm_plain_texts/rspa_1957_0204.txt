tldr: The authors measured the ultrasonic dispersion in gaseous sulphur dioxide at different temperatures and frequencies. They found that the dispersion involving the major part of the vibrational specific heat occurs at all temperatures and that each dispersion zone corresponds to two distinct relaxation times. This study provides insights into the activation of vibrational modes in molecules and the relaxation processes in gases.
