tldr: The authors studied the fine structure of neurons and interstitial cells in the nervous system of the giant African land snail, Archachatina marginata, using electron microscopy. They discovered different types of interstitial cells, including sheath cells, glial cells, and supporting cells, which play various roles in the nervous system. The study provides insights into the complex structure and function of neurons and interstitial cells in the snail's nervous system, which may have implications for understanding the nervous systems of other animals.
