tldr: The author conducted further experiments on the spectrum of silicium and its relation to stellar temperatures. They analyzed the spectra of silicium bromide and the spark spectrum of metallic silicium, identifying different groups of silicium lines and their prominence in various celestial spectra. The study confirmed the order of silicium lines in stellar spectra based on temperature, providing a better understanding of the chemical composition and temperature of stars.
