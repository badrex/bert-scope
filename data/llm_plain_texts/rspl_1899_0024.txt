revised_title: The Diffusion of Ions into Gases: Experiments and Theoretical Analysis
semantic_tags:
  - Ion diffusion

  - Electrolysis
  - Gas ions
tldr: This article presents experiments and theoretical analysis on the diffusion of ions into gases, specifically air, oxygen, carbonic acid, and hydrogen. The authors found that the charges on positive and negative ions are equal and concluded that the coefficients of diffusion of ions into different gases are related to the ratio of the velocities of the ions. The study also determined the number of molecules in a cubic centimeter of gas and the weight of a hydrogen molecule.
