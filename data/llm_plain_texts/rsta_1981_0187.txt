tldr: This article investigates the circulation and fronts of wind-driven shelf currents in continental seas. The authors analyze data from current meters and sea tide gauges to understand the dynamics of these currents and their relationship with wind stress and other factors. The study provides insights into the balance of forces and the role of wind in shaping these currents.
