tldr: This article discusses the tectonics of the Proterozoic North Atlantic dyke swarm, which occurs in Scotland, East and West Greenland, and Labrador. The dykes are found in a vast area of continental crust and are mainly composed of basaltic material. The study examines the structural control of dyke emplacement and the mechanical behavior of the Proterozoic lithosphere, providing insights into the global tectonics of the Proterozoic era.
