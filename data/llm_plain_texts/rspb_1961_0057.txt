tldr: This study investigates the cell wall organization and growth in filamentous green algae, specifically Cladophora and Chaetomorpha. The authors demonstrate that the spiral structure of the cell walls changes as the cells grow, and that this is a result of anisotropic stresses induced by turgor pressure. They also show that the orientation of cellulose microfibrils in the wall changes during growth, and that the direction of spiral growth can be influenced by environmental conditions. The findings support the multi-net growth hypothesis and provide insights into the complex nature of cell wall growth in these organisms.
