tldr: This article reviews the principles of protein-DNA recognition in transcription factors, focusing on the diverse protein architectures and the importance of shape and chemical recognition in specific interactions. The authors discuss the thermodynamics and kinetics of protein-DNA binding, emphasizing the role of DNA structure and flexibility in the recognition process. They also explore strategies used by transcription factors to increase specificity, such as dimerization and the use of multiple DNA-binding domains.
