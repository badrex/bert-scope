tldr: This article investigates the stability of vortex rings both theoretically and experimentally. The theoretical analysis considers the stability of a vortex-filament ring of small but finite core size in an inviscid fluid to small sinusoidal displacements of its centerline. The experimental investigation uses a laser Doppler velocimeter to measure the velocity distribution and determine the total circulation. The results show that vortex rings are unstable, with the number of waves in the unstable mode depending on the size of the vortex core. The theoretical predictions and experimental results show qualitative agreement in the prediction of the number of waves in the unstable mode and quantitative agreement in the prediction of the amplification rate in the early stages of growth.
