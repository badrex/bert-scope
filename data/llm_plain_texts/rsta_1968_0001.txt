tldr: The article studies the eigenvalue problem with unbounded and nonsymmetric operators in a Hilbert space. The author presents a general iterative method for the approximate solution of this problem, which unifies and extends previous methods for positive definite symmetric matrices and bounded operators. The method is applicable to a wide range of eigenvalue problems, including those with non-selfadjoint differential operators of even and odd order.
