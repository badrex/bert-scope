tldr: This study investigates the ability of neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) of fetal rats to grow through a lesion and restore conduction in long-term culture. The researchers found that after a complete transverse crush of the spinal cord, clear recovery occurred, with electrical conduction across the crush comparable to uninjured preparations. Axons stained with carbocyanine dyes grew in profusion through the lesion and beyond, demonstrating the potential for regeneration in the immature nervous system.
