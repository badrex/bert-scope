tldr: The author, William Huggins, discusses the wide-slit method for viewing solar prominences and corrects a previous account of the method's details. He explains the importance of limiting the field of view to the part of the spectrum corresponding to the refrangibility of the light of the prominence and using a ruby glass for better results. This method is valuable when the air is not favorable or when a spectroscope of small dispersive power is used.
