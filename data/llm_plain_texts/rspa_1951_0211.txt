tldr: The authors present a method for numerically integrating the boundary-layer equation to study the flow past an elliptic cylinder. They apply this method to Schubauer's measurements and find satisfactory agreement with the observed results. The study also suggests a possible relationship between separation points in different flow scenarios.
