tldr: This study investigates the relationship between atmospheric pollution and the potential gradient at Kew Observatory during 1921 and 1922. The results show that higher pollution levels are associated with increased potential gradients, suggesting that pollution has a significant impact on atmospheric electricity. The authors also calculate the potential gradient for a hypothetical perfectly clean day, highlighting the importance of reducing pollution for better understanding and predicting atmospheric phenomena.
