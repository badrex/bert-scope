tldr: This study investigates lung function and exercise response in two New Guinea communities, comparing highland and coastal populations. The results show that the highlanders have similar lung function to Europeans, while the coastal people have lower values. The differences between the groups are attributed to a combination of genetic and environmental factors, including physical activity levels and environmental conditions.
