tldr: This article discusses the evolution of regional metamorphism in the 1.9 Ga Wopmay Orogen, Canada, during three sequential thermo-tectonic regimes within an evolving continental magmatic arc. The study examines the stratigraphic units, structural elements, and metamorphic mineral assemblages, providing insights into the physical conditions of the changing regimes and their impact on the regional metamorphism.
