tldr: The authors present the SRC-II process, an improved version of the Solvent Refined Coal process, which dissolves coal in a process-derived solvent and hydrocracks it into liquids and gases. This process produces a distillate fuel oil with less than 0.3% sulfur, naphtha, and pipeline gas, which are expected to have a competitive selling price compared to petroleum-derived fuels. The SRC-II process is projected to be economically attractive and environmentally friendly, especially in areas where utilities and industries rely on petroleum products.
