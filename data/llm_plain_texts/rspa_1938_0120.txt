tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the disintegration of boron by slow neutrons. They used a cloud chamber to measure the ranges of disintegration products and found that the lithium particle had a range between 3 and 4 mm, while the alpha particle had a range between 8 and 9 mm. The results provide insights into nuclear physics and the behavior of particles in nuclear reactions.
