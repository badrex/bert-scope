tldr: The authors present data supporting a phase boundary in high-temperature superconductors that marks a transition from a vortex solid lattice to a disordered state. They interpret significant slope changes in electrical resistance measurements as indicative of this phase transition, which they believe is due to the disordering of a flux lattice vortex solid. This research contributes to the understanding of the behavior of superconductors and the nature of the transition between different states.
