tldr: The author conducted experiments using photographic methods to study the time-relations of muscle contractions and electrical changes in response to stimulation. They found that muscle contraction begins within one four-hundredth of a second after an instantaneous stimulus, and the electrical response is contemporary with the mechanical response. This challenges previous theories that assumed an interval of latent stimulation between the electrical and mechanical responses.
