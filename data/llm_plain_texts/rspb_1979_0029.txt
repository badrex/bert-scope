tldr: The authors propose an algorithm for solving the stereoscopic matching problem in human stereo vision. The algorithm consists of five steps, including filtering, zero-crossing localization, and matching. The theory provides a framework for existing psychophysical and neurophysiological data on stereopsis and makes critical experimental predictions. The algorithm is designed to select correct matches in situations with false targets and requires a wide range of disparity values.
