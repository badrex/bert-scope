tldr: The authors investigated flame propagation through dust clouds of carbon, coal, aluminium, and magnesium in a zero-gravity environment. They developed a technique of flat-flame propagation to measure burning velocity accurately and derived expressions for flame thickness and burning velocity. The study highlights the importance of radiation heat loss and the similarity between flame propagation through dust clouds and fuel mists.
