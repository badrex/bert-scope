revised_title: 'On the Termination of Nerves in Muscles and the Frog's Heart'
semantic_tags:

  - Microscopic anatomy
  - Nerve fibers
tldr: The author examines the termination of nerves in muscles, specifically in frogs, and investigates the structure of nerve fibers and their relationship with muscles. The author confirms the branching of nerve fibers at their ends but disagrees with the placement of these fibers within the muscular fibers. The author also fails to find the unique internal structure in the so-called terminal nerve-buds, suggesting they are just ordinary nuclei connected to the nerve fibers.
