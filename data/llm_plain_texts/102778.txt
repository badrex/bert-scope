tldr: The author, Charles King, discusses the stones found in the heads of crabs and their reproductive process. He mentions that the stones are located on the outside of the crab's stomach and move to the inside when the crab sheds its old coat. King also notes that male crabs change their coats before females and provides a reference to a book called "Gammarologia" for further information.
