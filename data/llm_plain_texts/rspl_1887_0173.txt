tldr: The authors studied the voltaic circles produced by the neutralization of acid and alkaline fluids and their related forms of electromotors. They observed a series of rhythmical groups in the spectrum and found a resemblance to certain parts of the water spectrum. The authors also discovered several lines that matched Dr. Grinwald's predictions, particularly in the extremities of the spectrum.
