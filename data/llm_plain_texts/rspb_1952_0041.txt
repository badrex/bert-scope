revised_title: 'The Role of Food Transmission in Honeybee Division of Labour'

  - Honeybee behavior
  - Division of labour
  - Communication in honeybees
  - Foraging activities
  - Colony dynamics
tldr: The author's study on honeybee workers found that the division of labor in a colony is not determined by the age of the workers but by the requirements of the colony. Food transmission plays a crucial role in communication within the colony, helping to determine the tasks each worker performs. The study also shows that the duration of foraging life is shorter for bees that start foraging at a later age, indicating that senility may play a part in determining the longevity of these bees.
