tldr: The author conducted a gravity survey in East Africa to study the distribution of density in the outer layers of the Earth and gain insights into the origin and history of the Rift Valleys. The survey involved measuring gravity at 57 stations across Kenya, Uganda, the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, the Belgian Congo, and Tanganyika Territory. The results provided evidence to distinguish between various hypotheses on the continent's geological structure and history.
