tldr: The authors investigate two cases of equilibrium for a highly conducting plasma and analyze their stability. In the first case, a plasma is supported against gravity by a horizontal magnetic field and found to be unstable. In the second case, the so-called pinch effect is studied, where a plasma is kept within a cylinder by a toroidal magnetic field and found unstable against lateral distortions.
