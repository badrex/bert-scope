tldr: The author describes the synthesis of mustard oils and their isomers, focusing on the compounds isomeric with the well-known sulphocyanic ethers. The process involves treating monamines with bisulphide of carbon, followed by the action of heat and conversion into sulphuretted ureas and then deprived of one molecule of monamine using anhydrous phosphoric acid. The author discusses the physical properties and synthesis of various mustard oils, including ethylic, methyl, amyl, and tolylic mustard oils, as well as the isomer benzylamine mustard oil.
