  - Metastable states
tldr: This article investigates the ionization processes and autoionization in doubly charged ions of noble gases, such as neon, argon, krypton, and xenon. The authors review the knowledge of analogous processes in singly charged ions, establish the general features of translational energy spectra, and characterize the collision-free process. They interpret collision-induced processes in terms of known metastable states of doubly charged ions.
