tldr: The authors examined subfossil ostracod populations in freshwater sediment profiles from the early Holocene to study the persistence of sexual and parthenogenetic lineages. They found that environmental fluctuations during this period provided an advantage to sexually reproducing ostracods over parthenogenetic forms. This suggests that the short-term costs of sexual reproduction are outweighed by its advantages in a changing environment. The results support the idea that sexual reproduction offers higher evolutionary rates and resistance to parasites, while parthenogenesis may be more advantageous in stable environments.
