tldr: The author, Dr. Hans Sloane, shares his observations on the growth and uses of subterranean trees found in underground mosses and peat bogs. He discusses the appearance of tree roots and stumps in these areas, the extraction of timber from these bogs, and the potential uses of this underground wood. Sloane also touches upon the presence of gold, silver, and other materials found in these bogs, as well as the possible causes for the destruction of forests and the growth of mosses.
