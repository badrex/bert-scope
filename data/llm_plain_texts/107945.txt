tldr: This article discusses experiments conducted at the Royal Observatory of Greenwich to determine the length of the seconds pendulum. The author made adjustments to the pendulum and used a vacuum apparatus to maintain a steady temperature. The results showed that the rate of the pendulum varied depending on the arc of its vibration, and a multiplier was needed to account for this variation. The author suggests a mean multiplier of 1.4 for future experiments.
