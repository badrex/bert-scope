tldr: 'This article discusses solar luminosity variations over different timescales, from days to past solar cycles, and their impact on Earth's climate. The author analyzes satellite radiometry data and explains how dips in total irradiance are caused by sunspots and their associated magnetic faculae. The study also explores the relationship between solar activity and climate, with a focus on the decline in solar irradiance between 1981 and 1986. The findings have implications for understanding and predicting climate change.'
