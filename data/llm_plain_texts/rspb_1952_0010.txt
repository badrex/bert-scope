tldr: The author's study on Bact. lactis aerogenes and proflavine resistance shows that bacteria can adapt to high concentrations of the drug in a short time, making selection of mutants an unlikely explanation for their survival. The research also reveals that secondary decay processes, such as filament formation, play a significant role in inhibiting bacterial growth under high proflavine concentrations.
