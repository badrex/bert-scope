tldr: The author investigates hydrocarbons in the series CnH2n+2 and explains how the carbon atoms are united in their structure. They study the boiling points of these hydrocarbons and find that simpler structures have higher boiling points. The author also examines the hydrocarbon found in American petroleum and its similarities to those derived from suberic acid. Further research is needed to determine if this boiling-point law applies to all hydrocarbons in this series.
