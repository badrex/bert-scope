tldr: In 1666, Arthur Coga and his team conducted an experiment of blood transfusion between a sheep and a man in London. They used a silver pipe to transfer the sheep's blood into the man's vein, marking a significant step in the history of blood transfusion. The patient reported feeling well after the procedure, and the experiment provided valuable insights for future medical research.
