tldr: This article investigates the natural selection of flower color in plants, focusing on the presence of anthocyanins. The authors find that pelargonidin derivatives are more common in tropical and subtropical species, while delphinidin derivatives are more common in temperate and alpine plants. They suggest that red-flowered forms have a greater survival value in most tropical plants, possibly due to natural selection favoring these forms in warmer climates.
