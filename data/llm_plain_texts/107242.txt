tldr: 'The author observed the newly discovered celestial body by Dr. Olbers and the expected comet. They found that the asteroid, later named Vesta, had a small size and a direct motion. The observations of the comet showed no visible nucleus and an irregular round form. This discovery added to the understanding of the new celestial bodies in the solar system and the field of astronomy.'
