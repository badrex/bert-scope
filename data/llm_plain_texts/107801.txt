tldr: The author, W. Heberden, recorded and analyzed the unusual heat of July 1825 in Datchet, Buckinghamshire, using thermometers to measure the temperature. He also conducted experiments to understand the sensation of'sensible cold' and its relation to wind and moisture. The author observed that wind has a significant effect on the rate of cooling, which contributes to the sensation of cold.
