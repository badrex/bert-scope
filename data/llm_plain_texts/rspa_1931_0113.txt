tldr: This article explores the wave resistance of an ellipsoid moving in water. The author derives mathematical expressions for the wave resistance and velocity of the ellipsoid using Bessel functions and elliptic integrals. The results show that the wave resistance is influenced by the shape of the ellipsoid and the ratio of its axes. The author also discusses the analogy between the wave resistance of an ellipsoid and that of a ship.
