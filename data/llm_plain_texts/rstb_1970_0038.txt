tldr: This study examines the motor innervation of cat muscle spindles in hindlimb muscles using various techniques in light and electron microscopy. The research identifies three types of motor endings: trail endings, p2 plates, and px plates. The findings suggest that the type of contraction elicited by stimulating a fusimotor fiber depends on the type of ending initiating it rather than the type of muscle fiber executing it. The dynamic response is controlled via px and p2 plates, while the static response is controlled by trail endings. The study also discusses the significance of oc fibers in mammalian fusimotor innervation and their prevalence in fast and slow muscles.
