tldr: The authors analyze the seasonal variations in ionospheric absorption and find that it is influenced by meteorological factors rather than solar or geomagnetic causes. They observe a winter anomaly in absorption and suggest that it has a terrestrial and meteorological basis. The study also reveals a summer anomaly in lower latitude stations, which may be related to meteorological phenomena in the lower atmosphere.
