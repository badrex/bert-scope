tldr: The author discovered that living plants excrete carbonic acid, which is released as a gas through their tissues. This process occurs during the day and is stimulated by sunlight and increased temperature. The amount of gas evolved varies depending on the plant's activity and growth. The phenomenon is dependent on the life of the plant tissues, and factors that arrest life also stop the excretion of carbonic acid.
