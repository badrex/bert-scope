tldr: The author presents a formal expression for the far field of a non-stationary source in general relativity using a weak field or Born approximation. They discuss the Newman-Penrose constants and provide a physical explanation for the theorem. The study focuses on linear perturbations of a spherical star with a fluid source and a weak background field.
