tldr: This article investigates the primary photoprocesses of chloroplast pigments in monomolecular arrays on solid surfaces using the Langmuir-Blodgett technique. The authors study the absorption spectra, concentration quenching, and fluorescence quenching by electron acceptors of chlorophyll in single monomolecular layers deposited on a solid substrate. These model systems help to understand the primary processes of photosynthesis.
