tldr: The author, John Debraw, conducted experiments on the sex and reproduction of bees using glass hives. He discovered that bees do not have true copulation and that their eggs are likely impregnated by the males, similar to fish. Debraw also found that all common bees are females and that they can become queen bees if raised in a specific manner. This research challenges previous beliefs about bee reproduction and provides new insights into the complex social structure of bee colonies.
