tldr: This article investigates the enhanced sensitiveness of high explosives, such as T.N.T., picric acid, tetryl, cyclonite, and penta-erythritol tetranitrate (P.E.T.N.), when mixed with various types of grit. The authors use the Rotter impact machine to measure the effect of grit hardness, size, and percentage on the explosives' sensitiveness. The results show that sensitization by grit is more closely related to the formation of local "hot spots" than other factors, and can significantly increase the risk of unwanted explosions in handling and manufacturing high explosives.
