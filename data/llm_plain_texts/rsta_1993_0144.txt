tldr: The authors analyze the accuracy of the generalized self-consistent method in modeling the elastic behavior of periodic composites. They introduce a new method that embeds a finite number of unit cells in a homogenized medium and demonstrate that the zeroth term in the governing integral equation expansion corresponds to the generalized self-consistent approximation. The study shows that the method provides accurate effective elastic moduli and local field representations for a tungsten/copper elastic fibrous composite.
