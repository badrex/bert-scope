tldr: This study compares the tissues of articulate brachiopods and bivalve molluscs in terms of their value to predators. The research examines the force needed to crush shells, the time required to drill through shells, organic content of internal tissues, tissue density, and inorganic content of internal tissues and whole animals. The results suggest that brachiopods may have low predation pressures due to their low tissue density and high inorganic content, which are not consistent with the possession of potent chemical defenses.
