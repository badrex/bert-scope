tldr: The authors conducted experiments on guinea-pigs to study the effects of vitamin C deficiency on tooth structure. They found that a lack of vitamin C led to dental abnormalities, including enamel and cementum issues. This research supports the idea that vitamin C deficiency may contribute to dental diseases in humans. The study also provides insight into the mode of action of vitamin C in dental health.
