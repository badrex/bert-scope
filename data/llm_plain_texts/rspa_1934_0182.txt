tldr: The authors investigated the structure of certain simple benzene derivatives using a new electron diffraction method. They determined the halogen-carbon bond distance in these compounds and discussed the carbon-carbon distance in the benzene ring. The study aimed to understand if the benzene ring is flat and regular, and if the bond distances are constant regardless of the number of substituents.
