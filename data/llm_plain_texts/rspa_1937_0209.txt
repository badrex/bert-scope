tldr: This study investigates the critical shear stress of mercury single crystals and examines the stress-strain curves to understand the effect of impurity content on the critical shear stress. The experiments reveal the existence of preliminary "sets" before true plastic yield and various forms of slip bands, providing insights into the mechanism of glide in crystals.
