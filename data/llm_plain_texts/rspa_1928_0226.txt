semantic_tags:
  - General Relativity
  - Wave Equation
  - Five-dimensional Continuum
  - Electromagnetism
  - Geometry
tldr: The authors explore Einstein's new metric and its application to the wave equation. They discuss the five-dimensional continuum and how it unites gravitational and electromagnetic phenomena. The new metric allows for a simpler wave equation and offers a potential solution to the challenges of four-dimensional observation.
