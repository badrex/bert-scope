tldr: John Davy conducted experiments to determine the relative heat capacities of venous and arterial blood. He found that arterial blood had a higher heat capacity than venous blood, which contradicted some previous findings. The results support the idea that animal heat is produced in the lungs and is related to the nervous system.
