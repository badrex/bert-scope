tldr: The author, William Sturgeon, conducted experiments comparing magnetic electrical machines and voltaic batteries for use in philosophical research. He found that while both machines produced similar magnetic and luminous effects, the power of effecting chemical decompositions and physiological influence was weaker in the magnetic electrical machine when multiple channels of conduction were used. Sturgeon also explored the effects of combining the machines and found results consistent with theory.
