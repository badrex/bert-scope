tldr: This article discusses the development of exterior ballistics, focusing on the creation of a new gunsight that can accurately calculate range and elevation for various gun calibers and muzzle velocities. The author presents a new characteristic curve that helps deduce the trajectory of a projectile and compares range tables to demonstrate the effectiveness of these laws. The article also highlights the benefits of using this gunsight in military applications.
