tldr: The authors explore the geometric phase for chaotic systems and derive the classical limit of the two-form applicable to these systems. They discuss the time-dependent formalism, the Wigner-Weyl correspondence, and the semiclassical corrections associated with classical periodic orbits. This work contributes to the understanding of quantum chaology and the relationship between quantum and classical systems.
