tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the coefficient of viscosity of air using a torsionally vibrating wire and a hollow paper cylinder. They found that the loss of energy from air friction could be characterized as the dragging of the air. The mean value of the air's coefficient of viscosity obtained through this method was 0.00017746 at a temperature of 12.650 '0.
