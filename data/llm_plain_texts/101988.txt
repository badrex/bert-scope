tldr: The author, Martin Hartop, shares his observations and thoughts on the causes and nature of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions in Sicily. He suggests that these events are caused by incensed matter within the Earth, which can be compared to the process of making salt of tartar by desegregation. He also discusses the horizontal vibrations and the violent motion of the Earth during earthquakes, and how these can be attributed to the furious passage of incensed matter through underground grottoes. Furthermore, he mentions the connection between Mount Vesuvius and the Solfatara, two neighboring volcanic areas, and their reciprocal effects on each other.
