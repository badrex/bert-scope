tldr: The authors calculated cross-sections for electron capture by fast protons and alpha particles in hydrogen, considering both resonance and non-resonance reactions. They used the method developed by Bates, which accounts for the non-orthogonality of wave functions describing initial and final states. The results show that the effect of distortion is significant, and the cross-sections tend to be higher at moderate and high energies. The study provides a better understanding of electron capture processes and can be useful for future research and applications in nuclear and atomic physics.
