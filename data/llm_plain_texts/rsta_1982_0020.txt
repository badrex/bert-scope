tldr: The article presents an extensive investigation of Roby's projection-density method for electron population analysis, particularly as applied to extended basis molecular wave functions. The developed method assigns maximum possible populations to atomic s.c.f. orbitals and minimum possible populations to polarization functions. The author demonstrates the advantages of the Roby method over the widely used Mulliken method, highlighting its usefulness in determining unique effects of polarization functions and providing valuable insights into chemical bonding.
