tldr: This study investigates the influence of the brain hormone on blood retention in the mosquito Aedes aegypti. The research shows that blood retention is not directly affected by the hormone, but is dependent on the ovaries and may involve ecdysone. The findings suggest that ecdysterone can delay the onset of haem-defaecation in various scenarios, such as ovariectomized mosquitoes, sub-threshold feeders, and mosquitoes decapitated after taking a blood meal.
