tldr: The study examines the unique superposition eye structure of skipper butterflies, which allows them to have excellent vision in bright sunlight. The eye's anatomy and function are investigated through various methods, including electron microscopy and light microscopy. The research demonstrates that the skipper butterfly's eye functions according to Exner's superposition principle, providing a clear understanding of its optical system and vision capabilities.
