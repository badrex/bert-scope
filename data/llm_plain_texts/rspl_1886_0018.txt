tldr: The author discovered a method to induce intravascular clotting in living animals using a substance extracted from calf testis and thymus gland. This substance, when injected into the veins, causes widespread clotting and death. The author also found that the agent responsible for clotting is not the same as the one responsible for coagulation in shed blood. This research provides valuable insights into the understanding of blood clotting and its mechanisms.
