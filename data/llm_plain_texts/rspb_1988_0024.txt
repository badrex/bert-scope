tldr: 'The study describes the evaporation process in an Amazonian rainforest and its impact on the local and global climate. The research team found that about half of the incoming precipitation is returned to the atmosphere as evaporation, requiring 90% of the radiant energy input. The average evaporation over two years was within 5% of potential evaporation, and the data provides a basis for assessing the consequences of Amazonian deforestation on surface water and energy balances.'
