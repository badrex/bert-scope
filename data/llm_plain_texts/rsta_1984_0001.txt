tldr: The authors analyze six geomagnetic storms to understand the behavior of electrical conductivity in the Earth's mantle. They find that storm-time variations, known as Dst, can help model the global distribution of electrical conductivity in the upper mantle. This analysis provides insights into the Earth's mantle behavior and temperature profiles, especially in regions where phase changes in mantle materials occur.
