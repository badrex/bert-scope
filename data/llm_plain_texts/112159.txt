tldr: The author, Henry Charlton Bastian, examines the anatomy and physiology of nematoids, both parasitic and free-living, and discusses their zoological position and affinities to echinoderms. He describes the tegumentary organs, the nervous system, the digestive organs, and the water-vascular system in detail. Bastian also explores the tenacity of life in some nematoids and their similarities to echinoderms, suggesting that nematoids may be an aberrant division of the class Echinodermata.
