tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the homogeneity of helium and its separation using gas diffusion. They found that helium is indeed homogeneous and cannot be separated into lighter and heavier portions based on molecular weight. The experiments also showed that nitrogen is a homogeneous gas, as it did not separate into lighter and heavier portions during the diffusion process.
