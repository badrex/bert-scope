tldr: The authors analyzed the long-range alpha particles emitted from radium using a new detection method. They discovered that these particles consist of multiple groups expelled with specific characteristic velocities, providing new insights into the disintegration modes of radioactive atoms. This research is essential for understanding the complexity of radioactive decay and the origin of alpha particles from radium C.
