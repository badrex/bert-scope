tldr: This article discusses the development of penicillin resistance due to β-lactamase enzymes. It explores the structure-activity relationships and the modifications made to penicillin molecules to overcome resistance. The author highlights the importance of understanding these relationships to create new antibiotics with improved resistance against β-lactamase enzymes.
