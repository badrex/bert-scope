tldr: Anthony Van Leeuwenhoek's microscopical observations on red coral reveal its unique structure and composition. He discovered that red coral is made up of closely united roundish particles and contains numerous small cavities filled with coagulated salt particles. The heat treatment of coral led to changes in its structure and composition, suggesting that its hardness comes from the multitude of fixed salts within it.
