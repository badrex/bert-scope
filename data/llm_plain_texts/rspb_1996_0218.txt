tldr: This study investigates the roosting behavior of two phonic types of Pipistrellus pipistrellus bats during the mating season. The research found that mating groups never contained both phonic types, suggesting reproductive isolation and supporting the hypothesis that the two phonic types are separate cryptic species. The study also discovered that males emit calls of higher frequency than females for both phonic types.
