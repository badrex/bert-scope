tldr: This article presents a complete solution to the problem of classifying and enumerating polyhedra, focusing on their symmetry and construction. The author discusses various types of symmetry, such as zoned and zoneless, and provides a detailed analysis of different types of polyhedra, including monozone, zoned triaxines, and zoned polyarchaxines. The article also covers the enumeration of plane reticulations and their signatures, as well as the construction of various types of reticulations and coronations.
