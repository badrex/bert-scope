  - Temperature
tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of prolonged heating on the magnetic properties of iron. They discovered that the hysteresis of iron increases with time and temperature, reaching a maximum value before decreasing. This research is important for understanding the deterioration of iron in transformers and other applications.
