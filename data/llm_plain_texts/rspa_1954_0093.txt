tldr: The authors conducted a nuclear magnetic resonance investigation of n-pentane, n-hexane, and cyclopentane in the solid state to study molecular motion and crystal structure. They found that the reorientation of methyl groups and changes in crystal structure are responsible for the observed transitions. The results support the proposed molecular motion mechanisms and provide insights into the thermal properties of these substances.
