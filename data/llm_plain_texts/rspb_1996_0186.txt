tldr: The authors investigated the relationship between species and higher-taxon richness in protected areas across Indo-Malaya and the Pacific rim. They found that higher-taxon richness, such as genera or families, can be a useful surrogate for species richness in guiding tropical conservation efforts. However, the precision of predicting species richness from higher-taxon richness was often low, particularly for rich sites, and the performance of higher taxa as surrogates dropped sharply with increasing taxonomic rank.
