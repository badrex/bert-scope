tldr: The study investigates the iridescent cuticle of certain scarab beetles, which is optically active and selectively reflects circularly polarized light. The researchers discovered that the cuticle incorporates uric acid, which increases the birefringence and optical rotatory power of the beetle's reflecting layers. This makes beetles with uric acid in their reflecting layers reflect circularly polarized light far more efficiently than those without it. The study also explains the role of a unidirectional layer embedded within the helicoidal reflecting layer of some beetles, which helps in reflecting both left and right circularly polarized components of incident light.
