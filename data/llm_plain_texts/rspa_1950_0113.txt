tldr: The authors present a solution to the Bloch integral equation for the electron momentum distribution in a metal in an electric field, covering effectively the whole temperature range. They calculate the temperature variation of electrical conductivity using the obtained solutions and compare them with experimental results for various metals. The study provides a better understanding of the electrical conductivity of metals at intermediate temperatures.
