tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the behavior of negative ions in superfluid helium at extreme supercritical velocities. They discovered that the breakdown of superfluidity occurs due to two-roton emission, which affects the drift velocity of the ions. This finding challenges the previous understanding of single-roton emission processes and provides insights into the behavior of superfluids under extreme conditions.
