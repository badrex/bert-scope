tldr: The authors study the heat transfer from a heated film in an incompressible fluid, using the Wiener-Hopf technique. They analyze the trailing edge of the hot film and find that the boundary layer solution differs from the exact solution by a term of order for large values. The authors also provide an expansion in powers of for the heat transfer upstream of the trailing edge and discuss the application of their theory to hot films used in experiments.
