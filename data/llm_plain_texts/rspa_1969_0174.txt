tldr: This article presents a stochastic theory of the interaction between ions and quantized vortices in helium II. The authors describe the ion-vortex force, the capture process, and the Brownian motion of ions in the fluid. They compare their theory with various experiments, providing insights into the behavior of vortices and ions. The study helps to understand the ion-vortex interaction at close range, a frontier of research in the field.
