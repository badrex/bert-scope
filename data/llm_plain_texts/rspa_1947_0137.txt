tldr: This study investigates the development of turbulence in a long circular tube using a double-refraction method. The researchers employed a streaming double-refraction technique to examine the flow of a weak benzopurpurin solution in water. They observed two types of turbulent entry and found that the nature of the breakdown of laminar flow at a cross-section depends on the type of entry and the distance from the inlet. The researchers also investigated the development of complete turbulence at various cross-sections.
