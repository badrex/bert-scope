tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the atomic weight of glucinum (beryllium) by measuring its specific heat. They prepared pure metallic glucinum and used a modified Regnault's method of mixtures to obtain accurate results. The specific heat of glucinum was found to be around 0.06, which helped in determining its atomic weight. Additionally, a new type of crinoid, Themmatocrinus renovatus, was discovered at a depth of 1,800 fathoms in the Southern Sea.
