tldr: This study investigates the viscoelastic properties of six organic liquids in the supercooled state using a new experimental system. The authors found that the measured values of the shear impedance differ slightly from previous predictions, allowing for the determination of the retardational behavior of liquids with viscosities around 0.1 Pa·s. The results show that the retardational compliance of the investigated liquids lies within a range of four to thirty times the limiting high-frequency compliance. The temperature dependence of the characteristic retardation time is found to differ from that of the Maxwell relaxation time, and the existence of two retardation processes is observed in one liquid.
