tldr: The article discusses the structure and function of oviducts in terrestrial vertebrates, focusing on the role of cilia and muscles in the reproductive system. It examines the oviducts in eastern painted tortoises, domesticated pigeons, and rabbits, and explores how these organs transport reproductive elements in both directions. The study highlights the importance of understanding the mechanisms of the oviducts for fertility and reproduction in vertebrates.
