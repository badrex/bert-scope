revised_title: 'Initiation, Growth, and Disintegration of Explosions in Solids'
semantic_tags:
  - Explosives
  - Initiation mechanisms
  - Thermal decomposition
  - Crystal disintegration
  - Detonation processes
tldr: This discussion explores the various methods of initiating and growing explosions in solids, focusing on the role of heat, impact, and other factors. The authors also examine the disintegration of explosive crystals and its impact on the detonation process. They propose that the mobility of reacting species and the formation of 'hot spots' are crucial factors in the initiation and growth of explosions.
