tldr: The article reviews the United Kingdom's contributions to the International Biological Programme, focusing on nitrogen fixation research. It discusses the development of the acetylene reduction technique for measuring nitrogenase activity, the study of nitrogen-fixing blue-green algae, legume-Rhizobium symbiosis, and nodulated non-leguminous nitrogen-fixing plants. The research provided a basis for understanding the importance and potential of biological nitrogen fixation and helped to advance current research in the field.
