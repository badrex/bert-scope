tldr: J.P. Joule examines the expansion of solids by heat, specifically focusing on wood. He finds that wood's expansion is affected by tension and moisture. When wood is saturated with water, its expansibility by heat ceases, and it contracts with a rise in temperature. Joule infers that this contraction is due to heat reducing the force of capillary attraction. He also observes that a rise in temperature occurs when tension is applied, in accordance with Professor Thomson's formula. Joule's experiments further reveal the minute quantity of heat absorbed when bending or twisting an elastic spring due to the decrease in the elastic force of metals with a rise in temperature.
