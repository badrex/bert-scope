revised_title: 'Jahn-Teller Effect and Symmetric-Top Molecules in Electronically Degenerate States'
semantic_tags:
  - Jahn-Teller effect
  - Symmetric-top molecules
  - Electronically degenerate states
  - Molecular spectroscopy
  - Quantum mechanics
tldr: The authors develop a physical theory to interpret the infra-red, Raman, and microwave spectra of molecules in orbitally degenerate electronic states. They derive group-theoretical selection rules and discuss the electrical and mechanical properties of molecules exhibiting the Jahn-Teller effect. The study focuses on the rotational and vibrational spectra of symmetric-top molecules in electronically degenerate states.
