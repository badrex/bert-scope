tldr: This article presents a new method to determine the lifetime of active polymeric molecules in chemical reactions. The authors propose using a rotating sector and two beams of light to measure the rate of polymerization and the mean lifetime of the active molecules. They apply this method to the photo-polymerization of methyl acrylate and compare it to the interaction of hydrogen atoms, providing a complementary means of determining lifetimes of short-lived activated molecules.
