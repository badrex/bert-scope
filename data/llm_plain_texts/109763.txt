tldr: The author, Everard Home, examines the solvent glands and gizzards of three different birds: Ardea Argala, Casuarius Emu, and the Long-Legged Cassowary from New South Wales. He describes the differences in their gland structures and gizzard linings, which are adapted to their respective environments and diets. He also discusses the digestive systems of other birds like the Rhea Americana and the Ostrich of Africa, comparing their gizzard strength and intestinal lengths.
