tldr: This article presents a collection of observations and calculations made by various astronomers, including J. Bradley, Didaco de Revillas, Dr. Kearsly, Rose Fuller, Mr. Sartorius, C. M., G. R. Vanbrugh, and John Hadley, on a comet that appeared in January, February, and March 1736-1737. The authors describe their observations, compare them to computed places, and discuss the trajectory of the comet, its orbit, and its relation to the fixed stars. They also mention the difficulty of observing the comet due to its weak light and the errors in the assumed places of the fixed stars.
