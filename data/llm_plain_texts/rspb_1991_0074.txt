tldr: This study investigates slowly activating K+ channels in rat olfactory receptor neurons using patch-clamp techniques. The channels have a unitary conductance of 135 pS and are found in a small proportion of membrane patches. They activate gradually over 10 seconds and deactivate in a slow, voltage-dependent manner. These channels may contribute to spike frequency adaptation, post-stimulus hyperpolarization, and cell repolarization during the excitatory response to odorants.
