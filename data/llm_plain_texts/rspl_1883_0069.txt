tldr: The author discovered that Mahonia aquifolia, a common evergreen shrub, can act as a nurse for the wheat mildew (Puccinia graminis) and help spread the disease. The Mahonia plant hosts a specific fungus that is part of the life-cycle of Puccinia graminis, making it a potential source of the mildew. This finding helps explain the widespread nature of wheat mildew outbreaks in areas where the common barberry is rare or absent.
