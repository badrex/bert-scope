tldr: The study investigates the responses of a mixed phytoplankton population to nutrient enrichments of ammonia and phosphate in Lake George. The results show that nitrogen and probably phosphorus limit the growth of phytoplankton in the lake. Ammonia uptake rates were high, indicating nitrogen starvation. The addition of both ammonia and phosphate increased the respiratory rate of the algae but not the photosynthetic rate until after a period of growth. The findings have several ecological implications.
