tldr: 'This article describes an experimental method to determine the velocity of sound and its dependence on temperature. The author used a chronograph to measure the time it takes for sound to travel between two locations, one near a gun and the other at an observatory. The results showed that the velocity of sound is affected by temperature, and the author discusses the implications of these findings.'
