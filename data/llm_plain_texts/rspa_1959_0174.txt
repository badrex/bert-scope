tldr: The domain structure of magnetoplumbite crystals is described, revealing unusual behavior as the crystals are magnetized to saturation. The interaction of domain walls with inclusions and details of the basal plane pattern are examined using electron microscopy. The study provides insights into the anisotropy and magnetization properties of magnetoplumbite, which is similar to barium ferrite and has potential applications in magnetic materials research.
