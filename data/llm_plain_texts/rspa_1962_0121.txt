tldr: The authors study the effect of nitric oxide on the decomposition of paraffin hydrocarbons. They find that nitric oxide first inhibits the reaction, but at higher concentrations, it accelerates the decomposition. The authors propose a mechanism for this induced reaction, where nitric oxide abstracts a hydrogen atom from the paraffin, leading to the consumption of nitric oxide. They also discuss the implications of these findings on the understanding of the reaction mechanism and the role of nitric oxide in these processes.
