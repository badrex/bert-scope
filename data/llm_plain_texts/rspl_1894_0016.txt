tldr: This article explores the unique structure and function of composite eyes in insects. It explains how these eyes work differently than the simple eyes of vertebrates and how the definition obtained by a composite eye is measured by the total solid angle of view and the number of lenses in the eye. The author also discusses the limitations of composite eyes and how they are suitable for specific tasks, such as detecting movement and distinguishing between objects close to the eye.
