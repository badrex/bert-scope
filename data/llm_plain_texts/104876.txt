tldr: In 1746, Mr. Henry Baker reported a massive infestation of tree-beetle grubs in Norfolk, causing significant damage to crops and meadows. These grubs, which are the larvae of the tree-beetle, feed on the roots of grass and other vegetation, destroying entire meadows and reducing crop yields. Baker provides information on the tree-beetle's life cycle, behavior, and potential control methods, such as using hogs and crows to eat the grubs or physically removing them from trees and burning them.
