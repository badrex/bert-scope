tldr: The author explores the properties and relationships of theta-functions, particularly those with two variables. They establish quadratic relations between these functions and express them in terms of new variables. The study of theta-functions' quadruple periodicity and their periods is investigated, leading to the development of equations and transformations that reveal connections between various mathematical concepts.
