tldr: The author, William Ritchie, conducted experimental research on voltaic electricity and electro-magnetism, challenging the prevailing theories of the time. He demonstrated that voltaic action could occur without the contact of dissimilar metals and that free electricity developed by heat does not become voltaic. Ritchie's findings questioned the widely accepted understanding of voltaic electricity and its relationship with common electricity.
