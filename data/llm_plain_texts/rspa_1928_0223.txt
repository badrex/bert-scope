tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the thermal and electrical conductivity of a copper crystal at various temperatures. They used a high vacuum to minimize heat loss and developed a method to account for lateral heat losses. The results showed that the thermal and electrical conductivities of copper crystals are affected by temperature, with the thermal conductivity decreasing and the electrical conductivity increasing as the temperature decreases.
