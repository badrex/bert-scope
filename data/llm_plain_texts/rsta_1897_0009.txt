tldr: The author applies harmonic analysis to the dynamical theory of tides and investigates the dynamics of ocean currents. They discuss the limitations of previous theories and present new methods for solving the period-equation and determining the types of oscillations. The research also explores the existence of free oscillations of infinitely long period and their importance in understanding ocean currents.
