tldr: This article presents a thermodynamical theory of turbulence based on a continuum model that incorporates various aspects of experimental results and applications. The theory develops a complete set of equations for viscous turbulent flow, including energy effects of turbulent fluctuations and standard thermomechanical effects. It also introduces two temperature-like variables and additional scalar quantities to describe the turbulent flow's microscopic and molecular levels.
