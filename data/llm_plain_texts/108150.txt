tldr: The author, W. Snow Harris, conducted experiments to examine the specific inductive capacities of various electrical substances. They developed methods to measure the intensity of charges and the degree of induction through different dielectric media, such as air, fluids, and solids. The results showed that the intensity of the charge sustained by induction through different insulating substances varied greatly, highlighting the importance of understanding specific inductive capacities in electrical experiments.
