tldr: This article discusses the mineral occurrences of lead, copper, and zinc in Tertiary sedimentary rocks along the eastern Red Sea coast in Saudi Arabia. The mineralization is linked to specific stratigraphic levels and is controlled by tectonic features trending NNW-SSE, which align with the Red Sea fault system. The study also examines the geological setting, including the Precambrian basement, Miocene formations, and Quaternary deposits in the region.
