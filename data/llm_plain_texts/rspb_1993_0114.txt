tldr: The authors investigate the influence of habitat on the risk of bovine tuberculosis transmission between badgers and cattle in southwest England. They found that areas with increased numbers of linear features, such as hedges and roads, have a higher risk of disease transmission due to badger urine contamination. This suggests that badger control operations should focus on these areas to reduce the incidence of tuberculosis in cattle.
