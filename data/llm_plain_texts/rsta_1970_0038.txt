tldr: This article discusses the tectonic significance of regional geology and evaporite lithofacies in northeastern Ethiopia. It examines the structure and evolution of the Red Sea and the nature of the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, and Ethiopia rift junction. The study suggests that the region is underlain by an asymmetrically subsided block of old sialic crust, with implications for the tectonic history and evolution of the area.
