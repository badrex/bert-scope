tldr: This article examines the archaeological evidence from Europe to understand the transition from anatomically archaic to anatomically modern human populations. It discusses the population dispersal and continuity hypotheses and explores the correlation between the appearance of anatomically modern humans and the Aurignacian industry. The author argues that the uniformity of Aurignacian technology across Europe supports the population dispersal hypothesis, suggesting that new human populations rapidly dispersed into Europe with new technology and cultural innovations.
