tldr: The article discusses the H-Y antigen, a cell-surface antigen that distinguishes male from female, and its role in sex determination. The author traces the history of the H-Y antigen and its discovery, and presents data suggesting that although H-Y may play a role in male sex determination, it is unlikely to be the primary inducer of testis differentiation. The author also discusses the relationship between H-Y antigen and the Major Histocompatibility Complex, and the possibility of multiple male-specific antigens.
