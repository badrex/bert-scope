tldr: This article explores the impact of crystal and fold structure on the morphology of lamellar polymer crystals. It discusses various techniques, such as electron microscopy, electron diffraction, and atomic force microscopy, which provide insights into polymer morphology and structure. The author focuses on the influence of fold orientation and crystal transformation on the formation of lamellar structures in polymers like polyethylene, polybutene-1, and polypropylene.
