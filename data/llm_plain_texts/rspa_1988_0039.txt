tldr: The authors present a method for analyzing two coupled ordinary differential equations with three parameters, using recent advances in bifurcation theory. They focus on co-dimension 2 degeneracies and the Hopf bifurcation, providing a systematic approach to understanding the qualitative behavior of the system. This method can be applied to various fields, including physics, engineering, and biology, where such systems arise.
