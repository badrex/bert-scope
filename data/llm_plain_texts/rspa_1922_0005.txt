tldr: This article investigates the distribution of particles in colloidal solutions and the limiting concentration that causes uniformity. The authors conducted experiments with various colloidal solutions and found that the concentration becomes uniform due to the properties of the particles. They also discuss the influence of the medium and the importance of a limiting concentration in colloidal solutions.
