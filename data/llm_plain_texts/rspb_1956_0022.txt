tldr: This study investigates the biochemical changes that occur in uncomplicated copper deficiency and its potential relevance to demyelination of the central nervous system. The authors found that moderate to advanced copper depletion does not affect the activity or levels of various enzymes and metabolic pathways. However, activities of cytochrome oxidase and succinoxidase are reduced, and mitochondria from deficient rats are susceptible to 'ageing.' The study suggests that impaired phospholipid synthesis may be the cause of this susceptibility.
