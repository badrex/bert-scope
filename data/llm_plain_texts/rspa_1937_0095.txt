tldr: The authors propose a theory that proteins have a ring structure, made up of "cyclized" polypeptides, which can be considered as polymers of substituted diketopiperazine molecules. This theory explains the uniformity among proteins with different chemical compositions and the formation of globular shapes. The authors also suggest that multiple peptide links, rather than introducing new types of links, can build protein molecules.
