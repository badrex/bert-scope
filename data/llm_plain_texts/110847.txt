tldr: This article presents observations of terrestrial magnetism made during an Antarctic expedition on board the ships Erebus and Terror. The findings show that the magnetic phenomena in the southern hemisphere exhibit a duplicate system similar to the northern hemisphere. The results confirm the conclusion that spaces in the Southern Pacific undergo a translation movement from east to west, which is opposite to the movement in the northern hemisphere.
