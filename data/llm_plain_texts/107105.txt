tldr: The author conducted experiments on the spontaneous emission of light from various living organisms, such as herrings, mackerels, and glowworms. They discovered that these organisms emit light when in contact with air and that the light emission is not affected by oxygen gas. The author also observed that the light emission from these organisms decreases over time when exposed to air.
