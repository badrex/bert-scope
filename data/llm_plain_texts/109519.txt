tldr: This article investigates the previously held belief that nerves are like chords with no power of contraction and only serve as a medium for the brain to communicate with muscles. The author conducts experiments on dividing nerves, their retraction, and the effects of electricity on nerve function. The results show that nerves can contract independently of the brain and surrounding parts, and that electricity can temporarily suspend the functions of nerves without destroying them entirely. This research provides insight into the inherent action in nervous chords and challenges the concept of a nervous fluid as an explanation for nervous disorders.
