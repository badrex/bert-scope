tldr: The author investigates the spectral lines and temperature sequence of hot stars, focusing on the appearance of new gas lines, particularly those of cleveite and helium. They analyze the intensities of various lines in the spectra of stars to determine the most probable sequence of temperature and discuss the differences in behavior between helium and gas X.
