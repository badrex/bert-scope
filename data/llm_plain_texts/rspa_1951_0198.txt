tldr: The authors studied the thermal oxidation of methylamine and found that the reaction proceeds by a chain mechanism. They concluded that the attack on the organic molecule occurs at the methyl group, and the amino group remains intact during the initial stages of the oxidation. The results support previous findings that the ease of oxidation is influenced by the structure of the molecule and the presence of heteroatoms.
