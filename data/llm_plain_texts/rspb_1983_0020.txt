tldr: The study investigates the distribution of orientation and wavelength selective cells in different areas of the monkey visual cortex. It found that in area V1, wavelength selective cells are concentrated in the foveal representation and decline at increasing eccentricities. In contrast, the V4 complex and V5 have fewer wavelength selective cells and a lower concentration of orientation selective cells at increasing eccentricities. This research provides insights into the role of different visual areas in the monkey cortex.
