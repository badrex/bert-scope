tldr: This study investigates the ionic basis for the responses of the guinea-pig uterus to acetylcholine and catecholamines. The authors found that acetylcholine and catecholamines have different effects on the uterus, with acetylcholine increasing sodium and calcium permeability, while catecholamines increase chloride permeability. The study also suggests that the increase in cytoplasmic calcium concentration may cause the changes at the cell membrane.
