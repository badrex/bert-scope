tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the wave-lengths of lines in the spectra of sixteen elementary substances using a goniometer and photography. They employed a method similar to Cornu's to obtain accurate measurements and calculated wave-lengths for each line. This research aimed to provide a comprehensive record of wave-lengths for future workers in the field.
