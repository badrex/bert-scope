tldr: The authors analyze the geological constraints on the formation of the mantle root beneath the Canadian shield. They discuss the differences in crustal composition and age between the shield and the platform, and evaluate various models for the origin of the mantle root. The study concludes that the preferential development of the mantle root beneath Archaean crust is consistent with an origin by imbrication of partly subducted slabs of highly depleted oceanic lithosphere.
