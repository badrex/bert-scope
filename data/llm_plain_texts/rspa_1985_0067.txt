tldr: The authors studied the magnetic structures in the Rydberg series of In(I) and discovered that both diamagnetic and Paschen-Back effects can occur simultaneously. They provided a quantitative description of this combination and discussed the implications for understanding the behavior of magnetic patterns in complex atomic systems.
