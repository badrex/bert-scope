tldr: The authors investigate the change in lattice spacing at a crystal boundary and find that there is a contraction of the crystal lattice at the surface, which affects the spacing between the first and second layers. They calculate the change in spacing using electrostatic forces and consider the effect of Van der Waals forces on the surface layer. The results indicate that the contraction of the lattice between layers other than the first and second is negligible.
