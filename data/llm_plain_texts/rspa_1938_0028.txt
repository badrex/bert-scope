tldr: The authors conducted an X-ray analysis of the dibenzyl series, focusing on tolane, a compound with a triple carbon-carbon bond. They found that the central part of the molecule has a linear structure, and the triple bond distance is less than that in acetylene. The study also revealed a contraction in the length of the carbon-benzene ring link, which is difficult to explain by the usual resonance phenomenon in aromatic and conjugated systems.
