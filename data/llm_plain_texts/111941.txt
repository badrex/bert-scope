tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the maximum amount of zinc that can dissolve in lead and bismuth, and vice versa. They found that lead can dissolve 1.6% zinc, and zinc can dissolve 1.2% lead. Additionally, they discovered that zinc can dissolve 2.4% to 14.3% bismuth, depending on the conditions. These findings help to understand the behavior of these alloys and their potential applications.
