tldr: This lecture discusses the muscular motion and structure of hydatids, simple animals with no visible muscles. The author explains that their membranous bags possess a similar power to human muscles, suggesting that the principle of action in living animals is more extensive and simple than previously imagined. This finding challenges the theories of muscular motion based on complex muscle structures and encourages further investigation into the principles of muscular action in simpler organisms.
