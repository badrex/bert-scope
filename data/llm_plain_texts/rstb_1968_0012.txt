tldr: This article discusses the Triassic stratigraphy and palynology of the southern North Sea Basin, focusing on the type Germanic Triassic and the dated Alpine Triassic. The study uses lithological and palynological analysis to understand the facies development and age of the rocks in the region. The findings provide a better understanding of the Triassic System and its significance in the petroleum exploration industry.
