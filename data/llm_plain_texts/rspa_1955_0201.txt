tldr: The author criticizes the spin-wave theory of antiferromagnetism, pointing out that the theory's assumption of a small anisotropic term is not valid. The author shows that the spin-wave theory's ground state contains a significant contribution from fictitious states, which affects the accuracy of the theory's predictions. The author suggests that the spin-wave theory may be valid for larger values of the anisotropic term, but this remains uncertain.
