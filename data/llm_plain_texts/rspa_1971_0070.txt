tldr: The authors developed a new gauge to measure the film shape, pressure, and temperature within the elastohydrodynamic contact region of a disk machine. They found that the predicted sharp peaks of pressure near the outlet were considerably attenuated but still occurred in the correct positions. The associated dip in film thickness was also much reduced. The results provide a detailed comparison between theory and measurements for a known set of physical parameters.
