tldr: The authors construct a closed 3-form associated with solutions of the perturbation equations in Einstein-Maxwell space-times and obtain a covariantly conserved current, known as the symplectic current. They evaluate this current for axisymmetric, polar perturbations with harmonic time dependence of axisymmetric, static space-times and show that it reproduces the current found by Chandrasekhar and Ferrari. This demonstrates the existence of a suitable flux conservation law for coupled gravitational and matter perturbations in the theory.
