tldr: This article demonstrates how phylogenetic trees can be used to trace the history and transmission dynamics of infectious diseases, such as HIV-1 and hepatitis C virus (HCV). By analyzing the genetic sequences of these viruses, researchers can reconstruct the spread of the diseases and understand the factors that shape their patterns of diversification. The study highlights the potential of this approach to inform public health strategies and improve our understanding of disease transmission.
