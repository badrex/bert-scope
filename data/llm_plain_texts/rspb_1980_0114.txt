tldr: This article discusses the discovery and significance of neuroactive peptides in the central nervous system. It highlights the challenges in understanding their roles, such as whether they act as synaptic transmitters or modulate non-peptide transmitters. The author also mentions the chemical puzzle of comparing peptide structures with non-peptide molecules, like morphine, and the importance of further research in this field.
