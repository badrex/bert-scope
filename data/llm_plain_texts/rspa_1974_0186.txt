tldr: The authors observed a broad 'atomic plasmon' resonance and discrete features in the Ba I absorption spectrum using synchrotron radiation. They estimated the 4d threshold energy and found it close to Wendin's prediction. The results provide insights into the atomic theory and the importance of configuration mixing in the observed spectra.
