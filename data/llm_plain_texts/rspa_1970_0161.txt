tldr: This article discusses the production and properties of high modulus carbon fibers, focusing on the process of converting polyacrylonitrile (PAN) textile fibers into carbon fibers with a high degree of preferred orientation. The author explains the importance of maintaining the polymer chains parallel to the fiber axis during pyrolysis and the role of stereochemistry in intermolecular reactions. The article also presents the effects of heat treatment temperature on the Young modulus and tensile strength of carbon fibers.
