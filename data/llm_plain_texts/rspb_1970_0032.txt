tldr: This study examines the innervation of the frog's heart, focusing on autonomic postganglionic nerve fibers and comparing autonomic and sensory ganglion cells. The research uses silver staining and histochemical methods to analyze the nerve bundles and cells in the frog's heart, providing insights into the autonomic and sensory components of the heart's nervous system.
