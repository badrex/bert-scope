tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the scattering of alpha particles in helium and observed anomalies in the scattering. They investigated the excited states of helium nuclei and the resonance phenomena that occur when alpha particles interact with helium. The results provide insights into the behavior of alpha particles and the properties of helium nuclei.
