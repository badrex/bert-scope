tldr: The authors conducted experiments using the Cartesian diver ultramicro-manometer to measure aerobic glycolysis in different regions of amphibian gastrulae. They found that aerobic glycolysis is very small or absent in both the dorsal lip region and ventral ectoderm, indicating that the Pasteur effect is equally efficient in all regions studied.
