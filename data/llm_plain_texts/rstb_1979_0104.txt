tldr: This article discusses the complexity of relations between human health and the geochemical environment. It emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary efforts, including collaboration between chemists, geologists, nutritionists, epidemiologists, and physicians. The authors highlight the need for more work on chemical speciation in rocks, soils, waters, and plant materials, as well as joint planning between geochemists and health specialists. They also suggest the importance of conducting combined epidemiological and geochemical studies in developing countries to gather valuable base-line data.
