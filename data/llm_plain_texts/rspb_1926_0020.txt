tldr: The authors conducted micro-injection experiments on living cells to study the oxidation-reduction potential of the cell-interior. They investigated the internal rH of Amoeba proteus and Nyctotherus cordiformis under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The results provide insights into the cellular processes and the effects of anaerobiosis on the oxidation-reduction potential.
