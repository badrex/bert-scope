tldr: The author examines the relationship between diurnal barometric maxima and critical conditions of temperature, cloud, and rainfall. They propose a hypothesis that the increase in pressure during the forenoon is due to the expansion of the heated and expanding atmosphere, which is then transmitted to the overlying strata. This hypothesis is tested using data from various stations, and the results show a systematic delay in the barometric maximum following the most rapid rise in temperature.
