  - Diffraction
  - Ewald Waves
  - Crystal Waves
  - Lattice Theory
  - Scattering Cross-Section
tldr: The article explores the diffraction of waves generated by a lattice of s-wave scatterers. It introduces Ewald waves and crystal waves, explaining their properties and how they relate to the scattering of waves in a lattice. The study also discusses the differences between electron and X-ray diffraction and the implications of scattering cross-sections on diffraction patterns.
