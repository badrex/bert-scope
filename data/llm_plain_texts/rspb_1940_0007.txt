tldr: This study investigates the effect of adaptation on subjective brightness using binocular comparison. The researchers found that the state of adaptation of the eye can be determined by the light intensity to which it is exposed, and that the method of binocular comparison allows for the establishment of combinations of states of adaptation and test light intensities that result in equal sensation intensities. This research provides insight into how adaptation affects our perception of brightness.
