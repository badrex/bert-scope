tldr: 'This article explores the role of inositol lipids in controlling cell growth and DNA replication. It discusses how the hydrolysis of inositol lipids generates second messengers, such as diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, which play a crucial role in regulating intracellular calcium and initiating the program of cell growth. The article also examines the metabolic pathways of these second messengers and their effects within the cell, including the activation of protein kinase C and the regulation of intracellular pH.'
