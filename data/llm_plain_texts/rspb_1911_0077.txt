tldr: The authors conducted experiments on spinal cord preparations to study the intrinsic factors involved in the act of progression in mammals. They discovered that the act of progression is not solely determined by peripheral stimuli from the skin or muscles but is also influenced by central interactions between spinal centers. The study sheds light on the complex coordination of movements and the role of central and peripheral factors in the act of progression.
