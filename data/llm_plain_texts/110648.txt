tldr: The author examines the principles and methods for solving the problem of fluid equilibrium under accelerating forces. They demonstrate that the pressure in a fluid at rest is the same at all points on the same level surface, and that the figure of the fluid mass can be determined by the conditions of equilibrium. The author also discusses the importance of understanding the relationship between pressure, forces, and the level surfaces of a fluid.
