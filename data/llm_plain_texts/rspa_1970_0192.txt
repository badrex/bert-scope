tldr: The authors develop a gauge-invariant Hamiltonian for the interaction of molecules with the electromagnetic field using Dirac's canonical quantization procedure. The new Hamiltonian is expressed in terms of gauge-invariant field strengths and electric and magnetic multipole moments of the molecules, providing a more general and powerful approach to the study of molecular quantum electrodynamics.
