tldr: The author presents a geometrical formula to calculate the deviation of a free pendulum, like Foucault's pendulum, based on latitude and difference of meridians or hour-angle. The author assumes the Earth to be a sphere and suggests that any differences between the calculated and observed deviations could be due to the Earth's ellipticity. The author believes that accurate observations of Foucault's pendulum in different locations could help determine the Earth's ellipticity.
