tldr: The authors studied the afferent innervation of muscle spindles in the cat, focusing on single and tandem types. They found that the typical pattern for a tandem spindle is for a complex or intermediate capsule to be linked with one or two simple capsules. The primary ending in simple capsules is always either wholly or predominantly irregular. The study also revealed that the proportion of tandem spindles varies across different muscles in the cat.
