tldr: This article discusses the meiotic process in two unusual yeast mutants and an apomictic strain. The first mutant, spo 11, does not undergo premeiotic DNA synthesis but still forms synaptonemal complexes and undergoes recombination. The second mutant and apomictic strain produce only two spores per ascus by skipping one meiotic division. The study provides insights into chromosome pairing, exchange, and the independence of meiotic recombination, disjunction, and chromosome segregation under abnormal conditions.
