tldr: 'The article describes the colonization of Motmot, a volcanic island created in 1968 in Lake Wisdom, Papua New Guinea. The island's flora and fauna were surveyed in 1969, 1971, 1972, and 1973. The island's plant life grew rapidly, with sedges of the genus Cyperus being the most successful colonizers. Invertebrates colonized the island in various ways, including ants, earwigs, lycosid spiders, staphylinids, and collembolans. The 1973 eruptions killed most of the plant community but had little effect on the invertebrate fauna. This study provides insight into the process of colonization on a newly created tropical island.'
