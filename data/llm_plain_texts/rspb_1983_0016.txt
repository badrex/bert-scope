tldr: The authors studied the effects of CO2 and O2 concentrations on the induction fluorescence in leaves. They found that changing the periods of light and darkness before measurement can modify the secondary fluorescence kinetics. The M peak in chlorophyll a fluorescence is abolished by exposure to CO2-free air and greatly modified by exposure to 5% CO2. The results suggest that chlorophyll a fluorescence could be a means of following ATP utilization in vivo and provide insights into the regulation of photosynthetic carbon assimilation.
