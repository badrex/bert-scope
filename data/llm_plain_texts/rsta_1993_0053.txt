tldr: The North Sea Project was a five-year collaboration between institute and university scientists that aimed to study the North Sea's processes and improve understanding of its environmental water quality. The project focused on developing environmental models, observing the seasonal cycle, and conducting interdisciplinary studies to address the challenges faced by coastal seas. The project's findings have implications for managing the North Sea's environment and addressing the impact of human activities on its ecosystem.
