  - Forward and reverse characteristics
tldr: The authors analyze direct current-voltage curves of contact rectifiers using a unified method based on both forward and reverse characteristics. They develop a diffusion theory without appealing to Einstein's relation, which helps in understanding the shapes of experimental curves and testing the validity of Einstein's equation for electrons and holes in barrier layers.
