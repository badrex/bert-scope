tldr: The author, Peter Woulfe, presents a new method of distillation that allows for the condensation of acids and volatile alkalis without loss and reduces noxious fumes. The method involves passing fumes through water, which captures the vapors, and using a two-bottle system to maintain consistent strength. This technique saves materials and protects the operator from hazardous fumes during distillation.
