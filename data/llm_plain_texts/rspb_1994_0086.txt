tldr: 'This study investigates the mortality costs associated with parental care and sexual dimorphism in birds using a comparative analysis. The authors find that changes in the extent and direction of sex bias in parental care are correlated with changes in the rate of mortality amongst adults. They also identify feeding and defense of chicks as the most costly forms of parental care. The study suggests that the costs of parental care directly influence adult mortality, while the costs of sexual dimorphism are incurred during juvenile growth.'
