tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effect of malachite-green on the physiological activity of Bacillus coli. They found that the organism underwent a profound change, losing the power to produce gas in certain sugars and polyhydric alcohols. This change was permanent and resulted in morphological and cultural variations, suggesting that Bacillus coli may have developed from a class of well-known soil bacteria.
