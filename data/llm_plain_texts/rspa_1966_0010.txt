tldr: This article studies gravitational waves from isolated, axially-symmetric sources using Bondi's metric and the double-parameter approximation method. The authors demonstrate that the source loses mass due to the quadrupole-quadrupole interaction and experiences a recoil due to the quadrupole-octupole interaction. The mass and momentum changes of the source agree with the results obtained using the pseudo tensor of energy and momentum.
