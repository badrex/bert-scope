tldr: Researchers discovered a phenomenon called 'fatal association' between dieldrin-resistant and susceptible Australian sheep blowflies. When susceptible adult flies were exposed to dieldrin-resistant adult flies raised on media containing sublethal concentrations of dieldrin, they experienced increased mortality. This finding provides an additional mechanism for the rapid evolution of resistance to dieldrin by the blowflies.
