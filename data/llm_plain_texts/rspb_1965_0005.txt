tldr: The author discusses the development of habitats in the post-Glacial period and the role of inertia and threshold related to post-Glacial habitat changes. They emphasize the importance of considering local microclimatic conditions and soil development in understanding the effects of climatic changes on vegetation. The author also highlights the need to be cautious when drawing conclusions from local observations and the complexity of factors controlling the distribution of species.
