tldr: The author, Anth. Van. Leeuwenhoek, examines the texture of animal bones, tree bark, and human skin using a microscope. He discovers that bones are made of tubes of varying sizes, while tree bark and human skin are formed by the interweaving of vessels. Leeuwenhoek also observes the process of transpiration and the role of sweat glands in the skin.
