tldr: This paper demonstrates the importance of distributed sensitivity analysis in assessing the predictions of a distributed model of turbulent river flow in a natural river channel. The authors apply a distributed sensitivity analysis to a model of turbulent open channel flow and show the significance of spatial feedback in environmental systems, which traditional sensitivity analysis approaches cannot reveal. The study highlights the need for a rigorous sensitivity analysis to improve model representation and reduce errors in predictions.
