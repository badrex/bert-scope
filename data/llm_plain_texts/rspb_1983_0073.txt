revised_title: 'Population and Quantitative Genetics of Many Linked Loci in Finite Populations'
semantic_tags:
  - Population genetics
  - Quantitative genetics
  - Linkage disequilibrium
  - Selection response
  - Finite populations
tldr: This article discusses the effects of linkage on genetic variability and response to directional selection in finite populations. It reviews theoretical studies and emphasizes predictions based on observable parameters such as population size, chromosome lengths, and the increment in variance from new mutations. The article also explores the impact of linkage disequilibrium on genetic variance and the consequences of selection in finite populations.
