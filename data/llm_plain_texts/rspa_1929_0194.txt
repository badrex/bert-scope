tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the scattering of electrons in mercury vapour. They discovered that the intensity of the elastic and inelastic groups of scattered electrons varies with the angle through which the electrons are scattered. The results provide insights into the atomic structure and the behavior of electrons in different states.
