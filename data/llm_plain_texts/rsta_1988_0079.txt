tldr: The authors analyzed seismic data from the Himalayas and Tibet to understand the crust-mantle structure and tectonic evolution of the region. They found a thick crust with varying structures and interfaces, suggesting a complex tectonic history. The crust-mantle boundary was identified, with the upper mantle having a high velocity, possibly due to reduced temperatures, anisotropy, or stress-induced anisotropy. The study provides insights into the tectonic evolution of the region and its implications for the broader understanding of orogenic belts.
