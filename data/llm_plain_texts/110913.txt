tldr: The author conducted experiments on the effects of electric wires on the growth of crops, specifically grass. They found that grass grew much more abundantly in areas near the underground wires, especially on the western side of the wires. The wire-enclosed area was in the magnetic meridian, suggesting a possible connection between magnetism and plant growth.
