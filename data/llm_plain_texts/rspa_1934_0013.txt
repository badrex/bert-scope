tldr: The authors conducted X-ray measurements on the thermal expansion of bismuth from room temperature to just below its melting point. They found no evidence of discrepancies in the thermal expansion coefficients using X-ray and optical methods. The study also revealed a small discontinuity in the coefficient of expansion at 75Â°C, which may be associated with an allotropic change in the bismuth crystal lattice.
