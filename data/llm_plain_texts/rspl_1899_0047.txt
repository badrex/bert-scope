tldr: This study investigates the effect of varying degrees of staleness in the sexual cells of Echinoids on their development. The research found that the onset of abnormal development is sudden and depends on the freshness of both ova and sperm. The study suggests that the period during which the sex cells remain normal should be as long as possible, and once they begin to deteriorate, their functional capacity should be lost rapidly to minimize the number of weaker organisms produced.
