tldr: This article explores the properties of a cubic curve and its associated curves using trilinear coordinates. The author develops relations between the cubic curve and the complex of lines that are the polars with respect to it. The study of these properties leads to the discovery of the Coates-point, the poloid, and the centroid of the cubic curve, which are significant in the understanding of the curve's geometry.
