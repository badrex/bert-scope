tldr: This article investigates the factors affecting the strengths of carbon fibers, particularly the role of impurities and heat treatments. The authors found that impurities in the precursor fibers reduce the strength of carbon fibers, especially after high-temperature heat treatments. They also discuss a failure criterion based on the strain energy in misaligned crystallites, which helps predict carbon fiber strengths.
