tldr: This article highlights the importance of organocopper reagents in organic synthesis and discusses various applications, including the synthesis of natural products, such as thia-thromboxane analogues and the antimicrobial natural product, tetrahydrodicranenone. The article also describes the use of double acetylene carbocupration for the stereospecific preparation of dienes, as demonstrated by the synthesis of the Navel Orangeworm pheromone. The potential of organocopper reagents in organic synthesis is emphasized, and their versatile nature is illustrated through various synthetic approaches.
