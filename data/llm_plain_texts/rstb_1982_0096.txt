tldr: The article discusses the ecology and interactions of sulphur bacteria, particularly sulphate-reducing bacteria, in anoxic-oxic interface environments. It highlights the role of these bacteria in the sulphur cycle, their metabolic processes, and their adaptation to life at the anoxic-oxic interface. The author also explores the oxidation processes of sulphide and the importance of these bacteria in various ecosystems.
