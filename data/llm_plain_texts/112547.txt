tldr: The Great Melbourne Telescope, a powerful Cassegrain reflector, was constructed in 1865-1867 by Thomas Grubb under the direction of a committee including the late Earl of Rosse and Dr. Robinson. The telescope features a 4-foot reflector, metal lattice-work tube, and a unique design that keeps the observer near the ground for easier use. The telescope's construction, design, and features are discussed in detail, along with its potential for astronomical observations.
