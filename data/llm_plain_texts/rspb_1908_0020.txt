revised_title: 'The Impact of Ammonium Salts on Soil Acidity and Nitrification'

tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the decline in yield and unhealthy condition of grass plots at Rothamsted that received nitrogen in the form of ammonium salts. They found that the soil of these plots was acid, which inhibited nitrification, a process essential for plant growth. The authors concluded that the plants could not obtain enough nitrogen in the form of nitrates and had to draw the larger portion directly from the ammonium salts supplied as manure.
