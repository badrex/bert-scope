tldr: This article discusses the hardening and softening of metals due to cyclic stressing. The authors explore the Bauschinger effect in single crystals and the hardening produced by alternating stresses in annealed polycrystalline copper and aluminum. They find that point defects play a significant role in the hardening and softening processes during fatigue. The study also reveals the importance of understanding the mechanisms behind these processes for improving the durability of materials.
