tldr: This article explores the phase transitions in two-component systems, focusing on the liquid state and its mathematical representation. The authors use the radial distribution function approach to study the behavior of molecular interactions in mixtures, providing estimates for the densities and critical points of condensation. The findings contribute to a better understanding of phase transitions in complex systems.
