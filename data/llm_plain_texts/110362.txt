tldr: Edward Turner's research focuses on determining the atomic weights of various elements, including lead, chlorine, silver, barium, and nitrogen. He criticizes the current atomic weight values used by British chemists and presents his experimental findings to establish more accurate values. Turner's work challenges Dr. Prout's hypothesis that all atomic weights are simple multiples of hydrogen.
