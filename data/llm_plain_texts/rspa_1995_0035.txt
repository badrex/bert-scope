revised_title: Geochemical Fronts in Groundwater Systems
semantic_tags:
  - Geochemistry
  - Groundwater flow
  - Heterogeneous mineralogy
  - Sharp fronts
  - Singular perturbation theory
tldr: This article explores the evolution of sharp geochemical fronts in groundwater systems, focusing on the impact of heterogeneous mineralogy and the propagation of fronts. The author uses a mathematical technique called singular perturbation theory to analyze the behavior of these fronts and their evolution in response to natural heterogeneity in the underlying fluid flow field.
