tldr: The authors conducted experiments with rat cerebral cortical slices to study the interrelationship of glucose, glutamate, and aspartate metabolism. They found that both glutamate and aspartate play an important role in the oxidative processes of brain tissue. Glucose stimulates the combustion of these amino acids while they, in turn, repress the oxidation of glucose. This study highlights the complex interplay between different metabolic pathways in the brain.
