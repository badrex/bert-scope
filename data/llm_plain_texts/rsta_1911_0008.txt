tldr: The author analyzes magnetic disturbances at Kew, focusing on diurnal inequalities and non-cyclic changes. They find that magnetic disturbance is the rule rather than the exception and that the connection between non-cyclic changes observed during quiet days and magnetic disturbances is complex. The study also highlights the prevalence of disturbed days and the challenges in understanding the relationship between magnetic disturbances and Earth's magnetism.
