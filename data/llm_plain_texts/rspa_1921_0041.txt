revised_title: Vibrations of a Spinning Disk: Analyzing Centrifugal Forces and Flexural Rigidity
semantic_tags:

tldr: This article investigates the transverse vibrations of a rotating circular disk, focusing on the relationship between centrifugal force and flexural rigidity. The study has practical implications for understanding the failures of turbine disks due to resonance between periodic forces and the periods of free vibration of the disk.
