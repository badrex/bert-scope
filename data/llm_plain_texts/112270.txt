tldr: The author studied the crystal structure and optical properties of benzoyl peroxide. They measured the angles of the crystals and found that the optic axes are in the plane 01 0, and they make a small angle with each other. The study also determined the index of refraction for different polarized rays. The crystal's optical properties were observed through polarizing apparatus, revealing rings surrounding the optic axes.
