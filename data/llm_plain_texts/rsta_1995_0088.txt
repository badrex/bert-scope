tldr: This article explores the chaotic behavior in two simple non-autonomous electronic circuits, demonstrating how even lower-dimensional circuits can exhibit complex chaotic dynamics. The authors study the MLC circuit and the first-order circuit with a 'jump-rule,' showing that these circuits can exhibit a rich variety of bifurcation and chaos phenomena through experimental results, numerical simulations, and analytical discussions.
