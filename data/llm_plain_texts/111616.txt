tldr: The author, Benjamin Guy Babington, conducted experiments to study the effect of soluble substances on the rate of evaporation of water. He found that different salts and other soluble substances in solution have varying powers of retarding or accelerating evaporation. This discovery led to the development of potential new methods for measuring humidity and understanding the underlying causes of these effects.
