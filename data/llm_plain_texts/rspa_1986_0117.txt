scientific_discipline: Physics > Gravitational Waves
tldr: The author presents a framework for constructing cylindrically symmetric solutions of the Einstein and Einstein-Maxwell equations, focusing on stationary monochromatic waves and their energy density. The study of these solutions has additional mathematical interest as they are reduced to Painleve transcendents.
