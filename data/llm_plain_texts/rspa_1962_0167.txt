tldr: The authors studied the damage caused by fission fragments to crystal lattices using high-resolution electron microscopy. They observed disturbances in platinum phthalocyanine and found evidence of complex dislocation arrays and dislocation dipoles remaining in the crystal after fission fragment bombardment. The research also extended to other materials like molybdenum trioxide and molybdenum disulphide, revealing dislocations resulting from irradiation.
