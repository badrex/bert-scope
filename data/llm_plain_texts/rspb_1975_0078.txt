tldr: The study investigates the re-innervation of axolotl limbs by severing the main nerves and redirecting them to different muscles. The results show that the axons of motor nerves regain control of their original muscle territories, restoring coordinated movement. This suggests that the return of coordinated movement is based on specific functional connections between motor nerve fibers and muscles, rather than reorganization of the firing pattern of motoneurons.
