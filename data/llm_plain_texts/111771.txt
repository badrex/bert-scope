tldr: The author examines the anatomy of Macgillivrayia pelagica and Cheletropis Huxleyi, two species of pelagic Gasteropoda, and suggests establishing a new genus for them. They share similar respiratory organs and other structural features, but have different shell types. The author proposes placing these Gasteropoda in a distinct order due to the differences in their respiratory organs compared to Pectinibranchiata.
