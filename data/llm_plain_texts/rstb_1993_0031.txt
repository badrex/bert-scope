tldr: 'Molecular chaperones, also known as heat shock proteins, play a crucial role in protein maturation and protect cells from stress. They help in the folding and assembly of proteins by binding to them and preventing premature folding. The hsp70 family interacts with proteins during synthesis, translocation, and assembly, while the hsp60 or GroEL family functions as catalysts of protein folding. These proteins are essential for maintaining cellular health and function.'
