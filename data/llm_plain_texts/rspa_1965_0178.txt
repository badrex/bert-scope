tldr: The authors conducted a rotational analysis of the A-X and B-X systems of AuBe and AuMg molecules, providing insights into their electronic band structures and ground states. They observed spin-splitting in the lower states and appreciable -type doubling in the excited states. The study contributes to the understanding of the principles underlying the stability of these gold-containing diatomic compounds.
