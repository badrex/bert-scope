tldr: 'This study demonstrates that Y1 receptors in the hypothalamus are responsible for the effects of neuropeptide Y (NPY) on feeding behavior and body temperature in rats. Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides targeting the Y1 receptor caused a decrease in body temperature and suppressed feeding behavior, while control oligodeoxynucleotides had no effect. These findings provide evidence that the Y1 receptor subtype plays a crucial role in the neuronal mechanisms regulating feeding and body temperature.'
