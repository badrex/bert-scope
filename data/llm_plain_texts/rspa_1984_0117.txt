revised_title: 'Proof that Every Electromagnetic Wave is a Bateman Wave'
semantic_tags:
  - Electromagnetic Waves
  - Bateman Waves
  - Maxwell Equations
  - Shear-Free and Geodesic Null Congruence
  - Minkowskian Space-Time
tldr: The author proves that every electromagnetic wave is a Bateman wave and that every plane electromagnetic wave is a Singe wave. The study is conducted in the context of Minkowskian space-time, and the results have implications for understanding the properties of electromagnetic fields and their propagation.
