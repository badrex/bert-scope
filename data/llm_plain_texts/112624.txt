tldr: The author conducted a study on the muscular anatomy of thirty-four subjects, focusing on the variations and abnormalities observed during the winter session of 1865-66 at King's College, London. The study aimed to understand the combinations of these abnormalities and the directions in which they chiefly tend. The author tabulated the results and provided detailed descriptions of various muscle variations, including the cleido-occipital muscle, epigastric slips of the pectoralis major, and the chondro-coracoid muscle.
