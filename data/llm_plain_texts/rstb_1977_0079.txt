tldr: The authors discuss the criteria and models used for reconstructing Gondwanaland, focusing on the southwestern region. They review the methods of reconstruction, such as matching continental margins, using geological evidence, and applying palaeomagnetism. The authors present two models within the uncertainty range, which have different implications for the evolution of southwest Gondwanaland, particularly the Antarctic Peninsula and the Weddell Sea.
