tldr: 'Edward Sabine examines the influence of the moon on the magnetic direction at Toronto, St. Helena, and Hobarton using six years of hourly observations. He finds that a lunar diurnal variation in magnetic declination exists at each station, with a double progression in a lunar day. The study reveals disparities between the amounts of easterly and westerly extreme elongations at each location and provides information on the times and magnitudes of these variations.'
