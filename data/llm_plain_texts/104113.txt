tldr: 'In 1732, John Hadley and his team conducted trials on board the Chatham-Yacht to test a new instrument for taking angles. The instrument was used to observe the positions of stars and the sun, and the results were compared to calculations. The trials aimed to improve navigation at sea by providing more accurate measurements of angles and distances. The study contributed to the development of navigation and astronomy.'
