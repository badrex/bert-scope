tldr: The authors studied the oxidation of gaseous methyl ethyl ketone and found that the reaction rate increases with time to a maximum. During the induction period, peroxides accumulate, and the rate of reaction is proportional to peroxide concentration. The addition of a trace of acetaldehyde shortens the induction period and accelerates peroxide formation. The results provide evidence that peroxides play a crucial role in the reaction process and that the reaction is non-stationary in its early stages.
