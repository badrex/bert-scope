tldr: The article discusses the extension of orbital theories in quantum mechanics, focusing on constructing suitable wave functions using spin eigenfunctions and density matrix formalism. The author explains how to resolve spin and permutation degeneracy and improve upon the Hartree-Fock approximation by incorporating configuration interaction and variation processes. This approach provides a better understanding of molecular systems and their properties.
