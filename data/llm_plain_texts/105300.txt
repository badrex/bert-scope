tldr: This article discusses the use of blisters in treating coughs and lung infections. The author, Robert Whytt, shares several case studies where the application of blisters helped reduce the frequency of the pulse, lessen fever, and improve overall health in patients suffering from various respiratory issues. Blisters are found to be particularly effective in cases of pituitous infarctions of the lungs, where they can provide significant relief and recovery.
