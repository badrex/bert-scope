revised_title: Uniform Asymptotic Representation of Reflected and Head Waves in Wave Propagation
semantic_tags:
  - Wave equation
  - Asymptotic expansion
  - Reflected waves
  - Head waves
  - Airy functions
tldr: The authors develop a uniform asymptotic expansion for integrals related to wave propagation, specifically for reflected and head waves. They use generalized Airy functions to represent the solution of the wave equation in the case of reflection of a spherical wave from a plane boundary. This expansion is valid in a region including a critical ray, allowing for a more accurate understanding of wave behavior near the critical ray and in the shadow zone.
