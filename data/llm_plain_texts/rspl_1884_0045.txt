tldr: The authors conducted experiments using an artificial thorax to study the origin of respiratory sounds. They discovered that the sounds of vesicular breathing are produced in the lungs, while bronchial sounds are produced in the trachea and larger bronchial tubes. The results of these experiments showed that the vesicular murmur is not produced in the glottis or trachea alone, and that bronchial sounds are similar to musical notes produced by air currents passing over tubes.
