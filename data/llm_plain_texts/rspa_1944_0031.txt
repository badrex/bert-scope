tldr: The author investigates the large barometer effect of penetrating showers and proposes that it can be understood in terms of exponential absorption of the primaries giving rise to the showers. The absorption coefficient of the primaries, required to account for the observed barometer effect, is of the order of 100 g per cmÂ². The study reconciles two points of view on the absorption of primaries and provides a better understanding of the phenomenon.
