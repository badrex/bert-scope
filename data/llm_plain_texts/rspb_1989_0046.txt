tldr: The study demonstrates that antibodies raised against bacterial antigen a-(2 \#151 ; \gt ; 8)-polysialic acid react specifically and with high affinity to the voltage-sensitive sodium channel in eel electric organ. The sodium channel is the only protein in electroplax membranes that displays this immunoreactivity, suggesting the presence of a poly-sialosyl-sialyltransferase specifically committed to this unique post-translational modification of the sodium channel.
