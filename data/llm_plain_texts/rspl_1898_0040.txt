  - Alternate current
  - Electrolyte resistance
tldr: This article explores the use of aluminium as an electrode in electric cells for both direct and alternate currents. The author investigates the resistance of the electrolyte and the effect of temperature on the performance of the aluminium electrode. The results show that aluminium can be used as an electrode in electric cells, but the resistance of the electrolyte and the temperature must be considered for optimal performance.
