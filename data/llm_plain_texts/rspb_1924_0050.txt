tldr: The authors developed a colorimetric method for the determination of urea, which can be applied to detect and estimate arginase. They found that the transformation of urea into ammonium carbonate affects the hydrogen ion concentration of the medium, which can be used to deduce the amount of urea hydrolyzed. The method is useful for analyzing urea concentrations in urine and blood of elasmobranch fishes.
