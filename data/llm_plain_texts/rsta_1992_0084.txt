tldr: This article discusses how pulsars can be used as precise clocks to study Newtonian dynamics in binary star systems and globular clusters. Pulsar timing allows for the measurement of small changes in distance, orbital eccentricities, and the masses of celestial bodies, providing valuable insights into the behavior of these systems.
