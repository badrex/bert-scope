tldr: This article explores the isotopic variations in rock-forming elements found in meteorites, which can be used as tracers for chemical processes in the solar nebula and to understand the origin and evolution of the Solar System. The study focuses on oxygen, magnesium, silicon, calcium, titanium, and chromium isotopes, analyzing their isotopic compositions and correlations to reveal information about the formation and history of the solar system.
