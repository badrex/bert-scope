tldr: The authors studied the addition reactions of the ethyl radical to unsaturated hydrocarbons, such as alkyne, alkene, and disubstituted ethylene. They found that the reactivity of these hydrocarbons towards the ethyl radical depends on their structure and the energy of activation. The results provide insights into the processes of hydrocarbon pyrolysis and addition polymerization.
