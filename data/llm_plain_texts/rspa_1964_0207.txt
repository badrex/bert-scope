tldr: The authors discuss the benefits of using polymer fibres for reinforcement in engineering materials, such as high strength, toughness, and thermal stability. They emphasize the need for developing cost-effective methods for producing and assembling fibres and adapting engineering design to make the most of their properties. The authors also highlight the importance of understanding the microstructure of these materials to prevent material failure due to environmental stress-cracking.
