tldr: This article presents a new model for potential flow past slender delta wings with leading edge separation. The model introduces a free boundary, a vortex sheet, which represents the vortex layer and the core of rotating fluid observed in real flow. The shape and strength of the vortex sheet are determined by satisfying boundary conditions, such as the sheet being a stream surface and sustaining no pressure difference. The model provides a more accurate representation of the observed flow pattern in real fluids, improving upon previous theories for the slender delta wing.
