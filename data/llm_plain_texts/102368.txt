tldr: 'In 1695, Mr. Halley reported an extraordinary hailstorm that occurred in Chester and surrounding areas. The hailstones were large, some weighing five ounces, and caused significant damage to windows, crops, and livestock. The hailstorm was part of a cloud that traveled over 60 miles, and its unusual persistence and the size of the hailstones were considered the most extraordinary aspects of the event.'
