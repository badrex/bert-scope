tldr: Dr. Edmund King presents observations of insects that live in old willow trees. He discovered that some of these insects, when exposed to warm conditions, transform into bees. These insects have stingers like bees and make a humming noise similar to bees. King initially thought they might be a type of wasp, but he later concluded that they are common bees.
