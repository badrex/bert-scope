tldr: This article investigates the chemical heterogeneity in the Earth's mantle by analyzing rare earth and other elements in apatite-rich xenoliths found in basaltic rocks from eastern Australia. The study provides evidence of metasomatic processes and chemical inhomogeneity within the upper mantle, which may be related to continental volcanism. The findings support the idea that these xenoliths represent samples of the mantle and suggest that metasomatism could account for the chemical characteristics of alkaline volcanism.
