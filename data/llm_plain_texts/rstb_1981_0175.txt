tldr: This article investigates the control of secretion in pancreatic acini by analyzing calcium fluxes and pools. The study finds that secretagogues increase calcium influx and release from a plasma membrane-bound 'trigger' pool, while intracellular calcium sequestration occurs in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. The findings provide insights into the role of calcium ions in secretagogue-induced enzyme secretion from the exocrine pancreas.
