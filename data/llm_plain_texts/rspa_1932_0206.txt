tldr: This article investigates the properties of shafts with keyways or cracks when subjected to torsion and flexure. The author uses conformal transformations to solve the torsion and flexure problems for various cases of shafts with indentations and slits. The study compares the effects of keyways and slits on the torsional rigidity and the distortion of the cross-sections of the shafts.
