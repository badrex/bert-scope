tldr: The article presents a solution to the integro-differential equation for the lift coefficient of a thin jet-flapped wing. The authors use various methods, including Mellin transforms, Wiener-Hopf technique, and Carleman's method, to solve the equation and provide expansions of the lift derivatives. The findings can be applied to practical applications of jet-flap schemes for lift and thrust production on aerofoils.
