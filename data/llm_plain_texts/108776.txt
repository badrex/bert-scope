tldr: The author conducted a comprehensive analysis of compass deviations in iron-built ships and wood-built steam-ships, providing valuable insights into the magnetic characteristics of these vessels. The study involved the examination of 42 iron-built ships and over 250 tables of data, which were used to calculate magnetic coefficients and understand the effects of magnetic forces on compass readings.
