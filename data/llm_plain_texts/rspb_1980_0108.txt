tldr: The authors used the semiempirical molecular orbital method pcilo to study the electronic charge distribution and conformation of the antibiotic actinomycin. They found that the drug has a considerable dipole moment and that the electrostatic fields can be separated into two large regions. These findings stress the importance of electrostatic forces in biological recognition phenomena and reveal a striking complementarity between the fields produced by the antibiotic and its receptor binding site.
