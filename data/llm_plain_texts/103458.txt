tldr: In 1725, Arthur Dobbs observed and documented an Aurora Borealis event in Ireland. He described the various shapes, colors, and movements of the lights, and proposed that the phenomenon could be caused by a combination of nitro-sulphureous vapors and cold, northerly air. This detailed account of the event contributed to the understanding of the Aurora Borealis and its causes.
