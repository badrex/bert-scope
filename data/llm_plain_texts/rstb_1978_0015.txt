tldr: This study examines the mid-Dinantian limestones in Gower, focusing on the Caswell Bay Oolite and Caswell Bay Mudstone formations. The Oolite is a light-grey limestone with shallow-water origins, while the Mudstone is a mixed group of rocks with varying lithologies. The research discusses the depositional environments, sedimentation processes, and paleogeography of the area, as well as the impact of diagenetic changes on the rocks. The Chadian sequence is abruptly terminated by Arundian overstep, suggesting gentle tectonic movement and anomalous paleogeography.
