tldr: The authors develop an asymptotic theory for a critical class of fourth-order differential equations with large coefficients. They identify a critical situation where all solutions have an exponential character in terms of the coefficients and where only two solutions have this character. The asymptotic forms of a fundamental set of solutions are obtained in this critical case.
