tldr: The author investigates the effects of temperature on the electromotive force and resistance of various types of batteries, including Daniell, bichromate, and Leclanche cells. The results show that the electromotive force decreases with increasing temperature for most types of batteries, while the internal resistance generally decreases. The author emphasizes the importance of considering both electromotive force and internal resistance when studying the effects of temperature on battery performance.
