tldr: The authors developed a new method to maintain a steady blood glucose concentration in rats and studied the influx of glucose into the brain under sodium pentobarbitone or ether anaesthesia. They found that glucose enters the brain through a saturable carrier-mediated mechanism with a Km of 7.2 ( /.mol ml-1 and a maximum influx rate of 1.13 ( /.mol min-1 g_1 brain. The mechanism was not affected by the type of anaesthetic used, and they did not detect any appreciable passive diffusion of glucose into the brain.
