tldr: Marshall Hall investigates the relationship between respiration and irritability in animals. He discovers that the quantity of respiration is inversely proportional to the degree of irritability. Hall also examines the phenomenon of hybernation, observing that during this state, animals have a much higher degree of irritability and respiration is suspended. He discusses the differences in habits of various hybernating animals and the effects of external factors like temperature on their lethargy.
