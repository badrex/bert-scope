tldr: The authors studied the chemistry of wing pigments in Pierid butterflies and discovered that the pigments are excretory substances. They found that the yellow pigment in most Pierid genera is a derivative of uric acid, and the white pigment in the white Pieridos contains uric acid as well. The pigments play a role in the butterflies' ornamentation, and their excretory nature is demonstrated by the fact that newly emerged butterflies sometimes void a substance resembling the wing pigment from their rectum.
