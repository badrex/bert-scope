tldr: The authors studied the isotope effects in the nuclear charge distribution of tin using various experimental methods, including optical and X-ray electronic isotope shifts, muonic isotope shifts, electron scattering, and Coulomb excitation experiments. They found that the changes in the nuclear charge distribution for tin isotopes can be described using a two-parameter Fermi distribution model. The results show that deformation effects contribute only a small fraction of the observed isotope shifts in tin.
