tldr: The author, Robert Lee, conducted a detailed study of the nervous system of the heart using various specimens, including fetal, child, adult human, and ox hearts. He discovered numerous ganglia and plexuses of nerves throughout the heart's walls and membranes, which enlarge with the heart's growth. Lee also found a significant difference in the size of ganglia and nerves on the left and right sides of the heart. The study sheds light on the extensive innervation of the heart and its implications for understanding cardiac function.
