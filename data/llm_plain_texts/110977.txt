tldr: This study investigates the function of intercostal muscles and their role in respiratory movements. The author demonstrates that external intercostal muscles are inspiratory, elevating the ribs and increasing the chest cavity, while internal intercostal muscles have a double action, serving as both inspiratory and expiratory muscles. The research also explores the differences between healthy and diseased respiratory movements, as well as the various types of breathing patterns.
