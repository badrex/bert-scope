tldr: This article discusses the applications of electron spin resonance (ESR) in studying reactive intermediates in chemical reactions, particularly in polymer chemistry. The author explores two topics: free radicals in radiation-induced oxidation of high polymers and free radicals during liquid-phase polymerization of monomers. ESR provides valuable information on reaction mechanisms, radical concentrations, and steric structures of radicals, which can help improve our understanding of polymer degradation and formation processes.
