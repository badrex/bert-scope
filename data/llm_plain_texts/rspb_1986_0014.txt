tldr: The authors conducted radiocarbon dating and stable carbon isotope analysis on fossil remains of extinct Indian Ocean tortoises to determine their age and dietary differences. The study confirmed that the tortoise species on Rodrigues, Mauritius, and Madagascar were contemporaneous and that they survived for several hundred years longer than previously thought. The authors also found that human activities, rather than climate change, were the primary cause of the tortoises' extinction.
