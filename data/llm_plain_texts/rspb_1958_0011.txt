tldr: The authors re-examined the fine structure of the walls of vesicles in the green alga Valonia using X-ray analysis and electron microscopy. They found that cellulose microfibrils are present in three orientations, in separate lamellae. The third orientation, previously overlooked, is less abundant due to less frequent lamellae and microfibrils being more loosely packed. The authors' model of the wall structure differs from the earlier model by Preston and Astbury, but supports their conclusion that the cellulose chains run in alternating directions in the lamellae.
