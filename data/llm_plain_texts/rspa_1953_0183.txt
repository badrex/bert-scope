tldr: This article calculates the radiative corrections to the scattering of electrons and positrons by electrons using the Feynman-Dyson techniques. The authors evaluate the cross-section for the production of bremsstrahlung during the collision and find that the radiative corrections improve the accuracy of the Mossľller formula for electron scattering and the Bhabha formula for positron scattering. The results provide a test of quantum electrodynamics in physical situations involving large transfers of momentum for the electron.
