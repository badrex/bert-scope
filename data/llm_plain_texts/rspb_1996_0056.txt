tldr: This study found extreme divergence of mitochondrial DNA within species of pulmonate land snails, with some populations containing up to five different types of mitochondrial DNA. The research suggests that the high levels of mitochondrial DNA variation could be due to the population structure of pulmonates, which favors the persistence of ancient haplotypes. This discovery has implications for understanding the genetic variation and evolution of these species.
