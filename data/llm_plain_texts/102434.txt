tldr: Richard Townley, a 17th-century English gentleman, conducted a detailed study of rainfall patterns in Lancashire, comparing them to other parts of England and Paris. He developed a method to measure rainfall using a cylindrical glass and a tunnel, and found that Lancashire had almost twice the amount of rain as Paris. Townley also observed a connection between wind direction and rainfall, as well as the relationship between rainfall and barometric pressure.
