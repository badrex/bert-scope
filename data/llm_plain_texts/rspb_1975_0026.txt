tldr: 'This study investigates the absorption, transmission, and reflection of radiation in animal coats, focusing on the relationship between coat structure and heat transfer by radiation. The research uses a simple hair system to explore physical processes and aims to establish general equations for radiative transfer. The findings can help improve the efficiency of animal production in various farming systems and enhance understanding of human comfort in relation to climate.'
