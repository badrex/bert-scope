with a layer containing cations in fourfold and sixfold co-ordination. The structure is thus a combination of a perfect spinel and a normal spinel type. The transformation of a-Fe203 to y-Fe203 is therefore a process of ordering the cation distribution in the octahedral interstices. The migration of some cations to tetrahedral interstices, as observed in the present investigation, is a necessary step in this process. The transformation is not strictly irreversible, since the a-y transition can occur under suitable conditions. The presence of the /?-phase traces seems to be the cause of the anomalous magnetic behaviour of haematite observed by Neel and others. The a-y transformation is a necessary step preceding the solid-state spinelization reaction involved in the formation of a ferrospinel. The transformation of haematite to /?-Fe203 is accompanied by a change in the crystal structure from rhombohedral to cubic, the unit cell and oxygen-ion framework remaining as in a-Fe203. The transformation of /?-Fe203 to y-Fe203 is also accompanied by a change in the crystal structure from cubic to cubic, the unit cell and oxygen-ion framework remaining as in y-Fe203. The transformation of haematite to y-Fe203 is thus a process of ordering the cation distribution in the octahedral interstices, accompanied by a change in the crystal structure from rhombohedral to cubic. The transformation of /?-Fe203 to y-Fe203 is also a process of ordering the cation distribution in the octahedral interstices, accompanied by a change in the crystal structure from cubic to cubic.
