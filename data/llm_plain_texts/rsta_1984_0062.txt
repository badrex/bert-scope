tldr: The authors present a classical many-body theory for the optical response of a molecular fluid, providing consistent expressions for the dielectric constant, refractive index, optical extinction coefficient, and optical scattering cross-section. The theory treats a finite material system and handles surface effects associated with transmitted and scattered light. This study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the optical properties of molecular fluids, addressing the challenges posed by the presence of bounding surfaces and the need to handle them on a microscopic level.
