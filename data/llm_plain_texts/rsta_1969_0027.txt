tldr: This article discusses measurements of lunar radiation at millimetre and submillimetre wavelengths, finding that the lunar poleward darkening function varies more rapidly with latitude than predicted by a plane homogeneous model. The authors also describe a centimetre-scale roughness model that accounts for the measured values of the darkening function and discuss the application of millimetre and submillimetre spectral techniques to astronomy. Additionally, they describe a possible experiment to detect the cosmic thermal background radiation at and below 2 mm wavelengths.
