tldr: The author presents a method for determining the distances of Jupiter's satellites from their axis using an instrument and tables of parallaxes and eclipses. The method involves measuring the parallax, simple parallactic intervals, and the times of eclipses to calculate the intervals of motion and the distances of the satellites from Jupiter's axis.
