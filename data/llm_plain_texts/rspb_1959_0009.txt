tldr: The authors conducted experiments on isolated retinae of various animals to study the absorption of light by retinal photosensitive pigments. They confirmed that deep-sea fish retinae have golden photosensitive pigments with high optical densities that absorb over 90% of blue-green light. The authors also found that the molecules of visual white in the bleached retina are orientated with their axes of resonance parallel to the axes of the rods, which can affect the eye's sensitivity and absorption of light.
