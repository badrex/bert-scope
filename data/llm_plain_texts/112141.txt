tldr: The author, Alexander J. Ellis, presents an improved form of Laplace's hypsometrical formula for calculating heights with corrections for latitude and temperature in barometric hypsometry. He discusses the importance of considering temperature variations and provides tables for easier calculations. The author also compares two methods of calculating heights and suggests that the gradual method is more trustworthy.
