tldr: The authors conducted electron nuclear double resonance (endore) measurements on a type lb diamond with nitrogen centers to study the nitrogen hyperfine and quadrupole couplings. They observed a small change in hyperfine coupling with temperature and provided a detailed analysis of the endor spectra and parameters, which can be used for comparison with self-consistent field calculations.
