tldr: The author presents a technique for generating a two-parameter family of stationary axisymmetric vacuum solutions from a one-parameter family of solutions of Einstein's equation. This technique can be applied to most known families of stationary axisymmetric solutions, providing a more extensive range of solutions for the description of the exterior gravitational field of rotating stars.
