tldr: This study investigates the stability and disintegration of water sheets falling vertically from a slit under different conditions. The experiments reveal that oscillations and disintegration occur due to self-induced disturbances and interaction with surrounding air. The findings contribute to understanding the behavior of water sheets in various applications, such as weirs and water management systems.
