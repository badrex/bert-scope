tldr: The author, David Brewster, examines the absorption of polarized light by doubly refracting crystals, specifically focusing on the color changes exhibited by crystals when exposed to polarized light. He investigates the arrangement of color particles in crystals and their relation to the ordinary and extraordinary forces exerted on light. This research contributes to the understanding of the optical properties of materials and the study of minerals.
