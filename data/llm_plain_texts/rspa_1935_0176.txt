tldr: The authors discovered numerous new terms in the spectrum of Fe II, which helped in the classification of spark lines and understanding the structure of the Fe II atom. They analyzed the spectrum using the 21-foot concave Rowland grating and interferometer measures of the vacuum arc spectrum of iron. The findings contribute to the understanding of atomic structure and chemical elements.
