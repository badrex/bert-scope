tldr: The authors describe the development of three new absolute radiometers for measuring radiation in the visible and infra-red regions of the spectrum. They discuss the improvements made to the original Guild radiometer, including addressing lead heating effects and refining the reflexion factor measurement. The new radiometers were compared, and their readings agreed within 0.2%, but differed from the original Guild radiometer by 0.5%. This work contributes to the maintenance and accuracy of the National Physical Laboratory scale of radiation intensity.
