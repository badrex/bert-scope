tldr: The author studied the physical properties of nickel steel, specifically its magnetic and non-magnetic states. They found that the metal has different resistances and mechanical properties depending on its condition. In the magnetisable state, the specific resistance is about 0.000052, while in the non-magnetisable state, it is about 0.000072. The non-magnetic state is softer, with a higher breaking stress and greater extension compared to the magnetisable state. The author suggests that if this material could be produced at a lower cost, it would have significant implications for various applications.
