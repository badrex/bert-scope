tldr: The authors studied the high-temperature decomposition processes of HMX, RDX, and BAMO using the T-jump/FTIR method. They found that the initial reactions of HMX and RDX release little energy, and the main source of heat comes from a highly exothermic reaction between the products. The authors also discovered that the gas products from the FTIR method closely resemble those measured with their filament thermolysis methods, which are easier to use. This connection allows them to establish the high-temperature and high-pressure decomposition processes of bulk explosive and propellants at burning surface temperatures.
