tldr: The authors investigated the water permeability of the basement membrane under increasing pressure using a unique method that measures the elastic recoil of the membrane as fluid passes through it. They found that the fibre matrix theory better explains the hydraulic permeability of the basement membrane, but a change in the configuration of the collagenous macromolecules composing the membrane is necessary to account for the profound reduction in hydraulic conductivity under increasing pressure.
