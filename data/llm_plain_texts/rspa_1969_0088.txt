tldr: The authors conducted experiments on iron and chromium to determine the Burgers vectors of dislocations using electron microscopy. They found that the commonly used two-beam diffraction contrast method often leads to incorrect conclusions in Burgers vector determination. The study highlights the importance of stringent conditions and careful experimentation to accurately identify and analyze dislocations in materials science.
