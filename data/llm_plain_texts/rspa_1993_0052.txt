tldr: The authors explore the spontaneous breaking of reflexional symmetry in quasi-two-dimensional (Q2D) turbulence, which arises as a result of three-dimensional helical travelling waves and solitons. They argue that this difference, primarily of a topological nature, is manifested in different spectral and diffusive properties. The study is supported by experimental data from laboratory experiments and observations in the stratosphere.
