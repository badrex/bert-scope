tldr: The authors conducted a long-term experiment on the effects of different manures on the mixed herbage of permanent meadows at Rothamsted Park. They found that the botanical character and chemical composition of the herbage varied greatly depending on the type and amount of manure applied. The results showed that manures effective for wheat, barley, and oats encouraged grasses in the mixed herbage, while those beneficial to beans and clover promoted leguminous species. The study highlights the complexity of agricultural practices and the importance of scientific inquiry in understanding and improving crop production.
