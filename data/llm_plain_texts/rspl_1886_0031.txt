tldr: The authors conducted a year-long study of Vesuvius' volcanic activity, recording daily changes in atmospheric pressure, lunar positions, and volcanic outflows. They found a strong relationship between changes in atmospheric pressure and volcanic activity, and suggested that lunar positions may have tidal influences on the liquid magma beneath the volcano.
