tldr: The authors study the effect of stratification on wave motions in a thin shell of rotating fluid. They find that stratification provides a restoring force for waves and can inhibit radial motions, leading to novel and noteworthy wave features. The results have potential applications to the Earth's oceans, atmosphere, and liquid core.
