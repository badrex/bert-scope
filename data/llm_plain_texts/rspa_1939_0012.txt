tldr: The article presents a general theory of relaxation methods applied to linear systems, specifically for solving problems in mathematical physics and engineering. The author demonstrates a method of successive approximations using the concept of relaxation to find the position of equilibrium in elastic frameworks. The theory is applicable to both discrete and continuous systems and provides a foundation for solving non-homogeneous linear integral and differential equations.
