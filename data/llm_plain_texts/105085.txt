tldr: This article describes an improved version of Savery's steam engine for raising water by fire, invented by Mr. De Moura. The engine features a float within the receiver that moves up and down, regulating the opening and shutting of the steam and injection cocks. This improvement allows the engine to work automatically, making it more efficient and self-sustaining.
