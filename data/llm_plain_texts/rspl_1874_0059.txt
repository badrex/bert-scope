tldr: This paper presents the results of experiments on the brains of monkeys, focusing on the effects of various brain lesions on their behavior. The author, David Ferrier, details 25 experiments and their outcomes, including the impact of destroying specific regions of the brain and the resulting effects on sensory perception, motor function, and cognitive abilities. The study provides insights into the localization of brain functions and the potential consequences of brain damage.
