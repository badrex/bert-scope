tldr: This article investigates the magnetic properties of almost pure iron, focusing on its hysteresis and coercivity. The author conducts experiments to understand the material's behavior under different conditions and discusses its implications for transformer design. The findings reveal that the iron specimen has exceptional magnetic properties, which could be useful in improving the performance of transformers.
