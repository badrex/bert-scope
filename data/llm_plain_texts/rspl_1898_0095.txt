  - Diophantine Analysis
  - Invariant Theory
tldr: The author presents a new approach to the partition of numbers, expanding the theory and introducing the concept of generating functions. These functions are analogous to those in invariant theory and can be used to solve linear Diophantine equations. The author also highlights the connection between partition analysis and Diophantine analysis.
