tldr: The author, Anthony van Leeuwenhoek, studied the vitrified salts formed after a hay-rick caught fire and burned. He observed that the ashes were condensed into a firm, light substance and conducted experiments to determine that the substance was mostly composed of fixed salts. He also described the various shapes and sizes of the salt particles and the process of their formation.
