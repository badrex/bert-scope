tldr: The author developed a new method for measuring color sensations using intermittent light and an unfinished apparatus. This method involves inducing temporary color blindness by alternating between monochromatic light and a spectrum, allowing for the observation of color sensation boundaries. The author believes this method could potentially replace existing color vision testing methods.
