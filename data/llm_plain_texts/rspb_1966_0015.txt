tldr: 'This study investigates the effect of light history on the photolysability of human visual pigments in the eye. Researchers found that a previous exposure to intense light reduces the density of visual pigments, which can affect the sensitivity of the eye to light. The findings suggest that understanding the impact of light history on the eye's photochemistry can help improve our understanding of visual functions and potential treatments for vision-related issues.'
