tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study isotope shifts and hyperfine structure in the atomic spectrum of tin using high-resolution techniques and enriched isotopic samples. They measured isotope shifts in three lines of the tin spectrum and found that the results were not in good agreement with earlier work but were self-consistent. The study provides information about the nuclear charge distribution in tin isotopes.
