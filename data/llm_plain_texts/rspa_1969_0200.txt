tldr: The author discusses a mechanism for X-ray production in Sco X-1, a celestial object, using cosmic X-ray astronomy. They propose that galactic X-ray sources have compressed magnetic fields that rapidly relax, transferring energy to ultra-relativistic electrons. This process leads to the production of X-rays, which can be observed and studied to better understand the behavior of these celestial objects.
