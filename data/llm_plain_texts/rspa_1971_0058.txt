tldr: The authors developed a new variable shear interferometer capable of infinite fringe operation and velocity measurement using laser light. They generalized the theory of interference to cover variable shear, double exposure, and Doppler shift techniques, allowing for a more versatile and efficient method to study refractive index distributions in stationary and moving media.
