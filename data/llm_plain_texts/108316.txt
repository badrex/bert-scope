tldr: The author, James D. Forbes, conducted experiments on a small glacier near the Simplon hospice in the Swiss Alps to measure its rate of motion. He found that the glacier moved at a slow pace, which he attributed to its small size, dry state, and the slope of its bed. Forbes also discussed previous measurements of glacier motion and the importance of considering various factors, such as mass and the state of infiltration, when analyzing the movement of glaciers.
