tldr: The article investigates the effect of impurities on the transition to superconductivity in tin-indium alloys. It discusses the behavior of these alloys and how impurities can influence the transition temperature and critical field. The study provides evidence for the existence of a range of coherence in the superconducting phase and supports Pippard's phenomenological theory of superconductivity.
