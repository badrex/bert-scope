tldr: This article presents model equations for the unidirectional propagation of long waves in nonlinear dispersive systems. It focuses on the initial-value problem for the equation, comparing it to the Korteweg-de Vries equation and discussing its applications in various physical systems, such as water waves and other long-wave phenomena.
