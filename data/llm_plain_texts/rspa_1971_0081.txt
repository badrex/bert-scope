tldr: The authors investigated the Fermi surface of barium using the de Haas-van Alphen effect, a phenomenon that reveals the oscillatory variation of a metal's free energy with magnetic field. They found three sets of oscillations with minimum frequency values and determined the angular variations of frequency by analyzing the oscillations' shapes. The results were compared with band structure calculations, showing that the predictions describe the Fermi surface of barium approximately correctly. Cyclotron masses for some extremal orbits were also measured, revealing a small mass enhancement factor.
