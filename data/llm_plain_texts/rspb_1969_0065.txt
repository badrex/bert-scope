tldr: This article discusses the complex interactions between the complement system, enzyme systems, and platelets in blood plasma. It explores the relationship between complement and other systems, such as the permeability globulin, clotting, and fibrinolytic enzymes. The article also examines the role of complement in hereditary angioneurotic oedema and the effects of plasmin on the complement system. The study highlights the need for further research to understand the underlying mechanisms and control of these systems.
