tldr: The authors examined the intimal changes in the arteries of aging swine and found that all pigs had intimal thickenings in the coronary arteries and aorta, similar to early human atherosclerotic lesions. These lesions increased in extent and histological development with increasing age. The study supports the idea that natural atherosclerosis in pigs is a suitable model for experimental study of atherosclerosis in humans.
