tldr: The authors studied solar changes, specifically sunspot activity, and its impact on temperature and rainfall patterns in the region surrounding the Indian Ocean. They found that there are two pulses of rainfall in India, one near the maximum and the other near the minimum of the sunspot period. These solar changes also have a significant impact on droughts and famines in India.
