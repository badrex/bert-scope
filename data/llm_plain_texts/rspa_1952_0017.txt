tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the thermo-osmotic effect of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, hydrogen, and water vapor through a natural rubber membrane. They demonstrated the existence of the effect in all cases and found that the experimental results align with the theoretical expressions concerning the rate of penetration through the membrane and the pressure ratio at the stationary state. The calculated values of the heat of transport are discussed in relation to a molecular-kinetic theory of diffusion in quasi-crystalline lattices.
