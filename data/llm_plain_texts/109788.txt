tldr: The author analyzed a new species of copper ore from the peninsula of Hindostan. They found that the ore contains anhydrous carbonate of copper, which is different from malachite and the blue carbonate. The ore has a dark blackish-brown color, soft texture, and a small-conchoidal fracture. The analysis provides evidence that the copper is in the state of black oxide, and the ore can be distinguished by its anhydrous nature.
