tldr: The article explains the tectonic settings and uplift mechanisms of high-pressure-low-temperature metamorphic rocks in convergent orogenic belts. It proposes that underplating in an accretionary wedge with negligible yield strength can cause the uplift of these rocks while plate convergence continues. This process helps to explain the observed features of regional terrains, such as the zonation, the absence of overprinting by higher-temperature assemblages, and the position of the oldest and highest-pressure rocks in the upper rear of orogenic wedges.
