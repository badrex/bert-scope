tldr: The article discusses the calculation of primary trajectories of seeds and other particles in strong winds, focusing on smooth spherical particles. The author presents a hybrid analytical-empirical law to describe the aerodynamic resistance to motion experienced by these particles, allowing for the numerical integration of the equations of motion and providing universal range tables for estimating dispersal distances. The study also explores the effects of pseudo-thermal convection on particle movement and deposition concentration.
