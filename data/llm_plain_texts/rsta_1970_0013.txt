revised_title: Analyzing Short-Range Order and Thermal Vibration in Pseudosymmetric Crystals

tldr: The authors present mathematical relations connecting the X-ray diffraction patterns of crystals with short-range order to the dimensions of those regions. They discuss the effects of temperature on the disorder diffuse scattering and provide a method to calculate the dimensions of ordered regions in triclinic and monoclinic pseudosymmetric crystals from the intensity of diffuse scattering.
