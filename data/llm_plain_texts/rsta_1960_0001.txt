tldr: The authors present matrix and other direct methods for solving systems of linear difference equations, focusing on the numerical treatment of ordinary differential equations. They introduce matrix operators and difference operations, and demonstrate their application to initial-value and boundary-value problems. The methods are illustrated through small-scale examples, but the authors believe they can be efficiently handled by modern high-speed digital computers.
