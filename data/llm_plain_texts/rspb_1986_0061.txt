tldr: This study examines the fecundity of North Sea plaice and its relation to fish size, age, and environmental factors. The research compares fecundity levels in different years and spawning areas, finding significant differences in fecundity between years and a gradual decrease in fecundity from the eastern English Channel to the German Bight. The authors suggest that fecundity modulation could play a significant role in the natural regulation of plaice populations.
