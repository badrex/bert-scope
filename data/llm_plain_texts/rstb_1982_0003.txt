tldr: Intracellular microelectrode recordings were made from probable motoneurons in the spinal cord of Xenopus laevis embryos during'swimming' in paralysed preparations. The cells had resting potentials of -50 mV or more. During spontaneous or stimulus-evoked'swimming' episodes, the cells were tonically excited, fired one spike per cycle, and were hyperpolarized by chloride-dependent inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. These results provide evidence for the relation of tonic excitation to rhythmic locomotory pattern generation and indirect evidence for reciprocal inhibitory coupling between antagonistic motor systems.
