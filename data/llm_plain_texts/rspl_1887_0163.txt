tldr: The author reports the observations of the total solar eclipse of August 29, 1886, made at Grenville, in the Island of Grenada. They observed the appearance and disappearance of bright lines in the spectrum of the chromosphere and inner corona, confirming previous findings by Mr. Lockyer. The observations were conducted using a 6-inch refractor by Simms with a grating spectroscope, and the structure of the corona was found to be radial to the limb throughout. The author also compares the results obtained with the Rutherfurd grating and Rowland's grating, finding them closely concordant.
