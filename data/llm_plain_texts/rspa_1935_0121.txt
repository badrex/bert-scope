tldr: The authors conducted X-ray studies on the structure of hair, wool, and related fibers to understand the configuration of the keratin molecule and its orientation in the biological cell. They discovered that keratin molecules form a flat "polypeptide grid" and found that by compressing the fibers, they could change the orientation of the molecules, allowing for a better understanding of protein structures and the structure of the biological cell.
