tldr: The authors explore the sources of horizontal deviatoric tension in the continental lithosphere that causes graben formation and extreme stretching of the crust. They suggest that tension originates from plate boundary forces, such as'slab pull' and 'trench suction' forces, and isostatically compensated uplifted structures. The tension is greatest in high heat-flow regions where the upper elastic part of the lithosphere is thinned and weakened, providing a possible explanation for the formation of certain types of fault-controlled basins.
