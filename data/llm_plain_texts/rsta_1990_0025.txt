tldr: This article examines the Precambrian cyclic rhythmites in Australia and suggests that they record tidal rather than solar rhythms. The Weeli Wolli Formation, Wollogorang Formation, and Elatina Formation are analyzed, and it is concluded that the rhythmites are better interpreted as recording tidal rather than solar rhythms, casting doubt on the influence of solar cyclicity on terrestrial climate in the geological past.
