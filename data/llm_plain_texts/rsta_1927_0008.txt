tldr: This article discusses the deferred approach to the limit, a method for solving mathematical problems involving differential equations and central differences. The author examines the -extrapolation method and its applications, including Fourier analysis and numerical analysis. The article also explores the use of interpenetrating lattices and single lattice methods in arithmetic.
