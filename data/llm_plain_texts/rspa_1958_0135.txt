tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the initiation and growth of explosions in solids, specifically focusing on the role of shock waves in condensed explosives. They discovered that the initiation of the chemical reaction leading to detonation occurs at or near the shock front, and the non-reacted explosive behind the shock is consumed by a reverse detonation or "retonation" wave. The study also suggests that the pressure distribution behind the shock front plays a part in the initiation process.
