tldr: This article discusses the process of determining the absolute intensity of the aurora line in the night sky and the number of atomic transitions required to maintain it. The author uses an auroral filter and heterochromatic photometry to calibrate the scale of intensities in observations made over seven years. The findings provide a better understanding of the aurora and its effects on the Earth's atmosphere.
