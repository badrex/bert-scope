tldr: This paper presents a theory of small deformations in thin, uniform plates under transverse load, using rigid-plastic material that obeys the Tresca yield condition. The study removes the restriction of circular symmetry and focuses on deriving and classifying field equations for various plastic regimes. The analysis is based on the principles of motion, plastic flow, and mass conservation.
