tldr: The authors investigated the fine structure of Raman lines in carbon tetrachloride and found that the intensities in the fine structure are consistent with a chlorine isotope explanation. They determined the abundance ratio of chlorine isotopes, which is in good agreement with values from mass spectra. The study also revealed that the total symmetric vibration Raman line in benzene and the components of the 459 cm-1 line in carbon tetrachloride are wider than the exciting line.
