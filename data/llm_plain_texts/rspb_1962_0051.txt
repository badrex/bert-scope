revised_title: 'Factors Affecting Oxygen Tension in the Brain and Other Organs'
semantic_tags:
  - Oxygen tension
  - Brain oxygen levels
  - Hypoxia
  - Hypercapnia
  - Adrenaline effects
tldr: The authors conducted experiments on rabbits to study the factors affecting oxygen tension in the brain and other organs. They found that the mean resting level of oxygen tension in the brain was 13 mm Hg, and it could be affected by various factors such as breathing, gas inhalation, and adrenaline injections. The study provides insights into understanding the oxygen levels in the brain and its relation to other organs.
