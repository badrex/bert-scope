tldr: This article presents a study of the Na2O-CO2-NaCl-H2O system, considering it as two four-component systems. The authors discuss the solubility determinations, the composition of solid phases in equilibrium with saturated solutions, and the temperature-concentration diagrams. The results provide insights into the behavior of these chemical components and their potential applications.
