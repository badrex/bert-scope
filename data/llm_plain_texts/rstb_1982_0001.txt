tldr: This issue of Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, B, Biological Sciences, features several studies on the neuroanatomy of amphibian embryo spinal cords, the central pattern generator for swimming in amphibian embryos, and the structural morphology of walking mechanisms in eumalacostracan crustaceans. The research aims to understand the development and functioning of these biological systems.
