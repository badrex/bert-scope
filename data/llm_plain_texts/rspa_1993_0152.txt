tldr: This study investigates the stability and bifurcations of the forced spring-pendulum, a two-degree-of-freedom nonlinear device, under radial motion excitation. Analytical, numerical, and experimental methods are used to explore the behavior of the system, including the effects of parametric excitation and the role of 2:1 internal resonance. The results provide insights into the complex dynamics of the spring-pendulum and its potential applications in understanding phenomena like the swinging heart.
