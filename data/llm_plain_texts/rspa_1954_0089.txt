  - Dynamo effect
tldr: The author investigates the influence of electron inertia on the Earth's magnetism due to its angular acceleration. They find that even for a large object like the Earth, the magnetic effect is negligible. Additionally, they conclude that electron inertia cannot be invoked to explain the Earth's magnetic field and that it would require extremely slow changes in acceleration to produce any effect on the weak field.
