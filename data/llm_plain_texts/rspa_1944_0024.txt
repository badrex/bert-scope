tldr: The authors discuss the causes and types of continuous spectra emitted by flames, emphasizing the role of atomic oxygen in combustion. They show that the yellow-green continuous spectrum in flames containing oxides of nitrogen is likely due to a reaction between nitric oxide and atomic oxygen. This discovery allows for testing the presence of atomic oxygen in a flame by introducing nitric oxide and observing yellow-green emission. The authors also explore the combustion mechanism using this knowledge.
