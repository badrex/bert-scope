tldr: The authors present a method to evaluate the higher order hyperfine terms in the spin Hamiltonian for an electron system with electron-nuclear interactions. They develop a unique solution for the parameters in the spin Hamiltonian and discuss its application in various crystal field environments, including octahedral, tetragonal, and trigonal symmetries.
