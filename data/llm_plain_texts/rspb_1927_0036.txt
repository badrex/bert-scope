tldr: This study investigates the energy used in sprint running and the efficiency of the body's energy utilization. The researchers found that the mechanical work done by the body during sprint running is about 38% of the total energy used. This efficiency is constant and of great theoretical interest, as it shows that the body's transformation of chemical energy into mechanical energy in the initial process of muscle contraction is highly efficient.
