tldr: This article presents a one-electron theory of nonlinear refraction, focusing on the design of optically bistable cavities for low-power switching. The author discusses analytic expressions for scaling and reviews the connection between giant nonlinearities and nonlinear optical mixing processes. The self-consistent semiconductor optical bistability problem is also summarized, providing a comprehensive understanding of the nonlinear optical properties of semiconductors.
