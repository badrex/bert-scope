tldr: This article investigates the variations of electromotive force between metals at high temperatures in fused salts. The author, Thomas Andrews, examines the effects of temperature on the electrochemical positions of metals like platinum and copper in various fused salts. The study reveals that temperature differences between metals can cause significant deviations from the normal electrochemical positions, and that a point of temperature exists where thermal effects counterbalance the normal electric action of the fused salt.
