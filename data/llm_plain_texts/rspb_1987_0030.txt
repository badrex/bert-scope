tldr: The study investigates the feeding behavior and prey choice of the onychophoran species Macroperipatus torquatus. The creatures feed on crickets and other invertebrates, using a sticky secretion to entangle and immobilize their prey before injecting saliva to immobilize and digest the flesh. The study examines the handling time and yield of different prey types, finding that larger prey are more profitable but less common in the environment. The growth rates of peripatus are also affected by the size of the prey they consume.
