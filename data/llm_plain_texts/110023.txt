tldr: Dr. Alexander Marcet conducted experiments to analyze the chemical composition of sea water and its saline contents. He found that sea water does not contain nitrates, mercury, or muriate of lime. He also discovered that certain rhombic crystals found in sea water are a triple sulfate of potash and magnesia. His research aimed to improve the chemical analysis of sea water.
