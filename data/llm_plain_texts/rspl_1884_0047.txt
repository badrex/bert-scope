tldr: The author describes the pupil-photometer, an instrument that measures the size of the pupil in response to varying light intensities. They demonstrate that the pupil's size can be used as a measure of light intensity and discuss the process of using the instrument to test different light sources. The author also explains how the pupil's size varies between individuals but maintains consistent ratios in response to light intensity.
