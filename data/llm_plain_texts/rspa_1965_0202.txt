tldr: The authors studied the crystal spectra of phenanthrene and phenanthrene-d10 near 3400 A, analyzing the weak absorption system and its electronic and vibrational components. They confirmed the A1-A1 assignment and discussed the perturbing vibration's symmetry. The results were compared to previously studied vibrationally induced transitions in benzene and naphthalene, providing insights into the molecular structure and electronic transitions of phenanthrene.
