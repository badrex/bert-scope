tldr: 'The author, John Kinnersley Smythies, presents a mathematical investigation into the universal law of attraction, including gravitation, as a particular case of approximation. He develops equations for the motion of spheres and applies them to various scenarios, ultimately suggesting a method of unlimited approximation for any unknown law. Smythies also discusses the physical impossibility of an exact, universal law and the impact of extraneous agencies on the motion of particles.'
