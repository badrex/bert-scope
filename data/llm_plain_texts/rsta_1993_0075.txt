tldr: This article discusses a method called'signature lipid biomarker' that allows for the in situ measurement of microbial biomass, community structure, and nutritional status in sediments and soils. The technique involves extracting and analyzing lipids from microorganisms' cell membranes and walls, providing quantitative information about the microbial ecology in sedimentary geochemical processes.
