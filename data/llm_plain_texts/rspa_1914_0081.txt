tldr: This study investigates the relationship between the size of water droplets and the electrical charge they acquire when splashed or sprayed. The authors found that smaller droplets carry a higher charge per cubic centimeter, and they also discovered different classes of ions with varying mobilities. This research sheds light on the electrification process in these cases and could help improve our understanding of the underlying mechanisms.
