tldr: The author examines a homogeneous model for a first-order, exothermic chemical reaction subjected to a linearly increasing external temperature. They study the conditions under which the temperature attains a local maximum and minimum or is always increasing with time. The findings can be applied to experimental procedures for determining chemical properties of substances by heating them in a furnace with a linearly increasing temperature.
