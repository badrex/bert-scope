tldr: The authors conducted harmonic analysis of tidal observations and determined the rigidity modulus of a platinoid wire. They found Young's Modulus to be 1222.4 x 10^3 grammes weight per square centimeter and the breaking weight to be about 6029 x 10^3 grammes per square centimeter. The specific gravity of the platinoid wire was also determined to be 8.78 compared to water at 20 degrees Celsius. The Society adjourned over Ascension Day to Thursday, May 21st.
