tldr: This article by Arthur Cayley presents a collection of results and tables related to binary and ternary quantics, focusing on their covariants and contravariants. The author defines various concepts such as invariants, discriminants, and reciprocants, and explains their significance in the study of quantics. The article also discusses the properties of ternary quadrics and cubics, providing tables of covariants and contravariants for each.
