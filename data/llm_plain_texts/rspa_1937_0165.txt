tldr: This study investigates the evaporation of sodium films on tungsten surfaces at elevated temperatures. The authors found that the surface potential of the sodium films decreases as the temperature increases, indicating a negative temperature coefficient of the work function. The results show that the work function of sodium films is greater than 120, which is different from the values obtained for other alkali metal films. The authors propose a model to explain the temperature dependence of the work function, involving the activation of adions to higher surface energy levels.
