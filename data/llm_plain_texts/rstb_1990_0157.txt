tldr: 'This article discusses the concept of imprinting, a learning process that occurs early in the lives of many birds and mammals, and its connection to social attachment and recognition. The authors argue that imprinting is not a unique process but rather a part of a general phenomenon in learning and memory. They explore the biological function of imprinting, the importance of developmental stage and motivational state, and the role of visual stimulus recognition in forming social attachments.'
