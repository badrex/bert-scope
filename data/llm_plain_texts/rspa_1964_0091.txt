tldr: This article presents a general expression for the density of states of non-interacting electrons in disordered systems, using two simplifying assumptions: the geometric approximation and an approximation concerning the potential. The author demonstrates how this expression can be applied to perfect lattices and discusses the implications for calculating the density of states and the change in the energy of electrons due to the presence of phonons.
