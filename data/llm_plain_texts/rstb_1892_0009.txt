tldr: The author, C.B. Clarke, discusses the challenges of using natural biologic regions as reference areas for species distribution. He proposes a new framework of tabulation areas that are simpler and more practical for organizing and displaying the geographic distribution of species. This framework aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of tabulating habitats and species distribution for better understanding and analysis.
