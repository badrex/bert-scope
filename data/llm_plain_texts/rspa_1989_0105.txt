tldr: The authors explore the localization of buckle patterns in elastic structures from three perspectives: modal, amplitude modulation, and dynamical phase-space analogy. They use a strut on a nonlinear foundation as an example and discuss the potential for spatial chaos in nonlinear elasticity. The dynamical phase-space analogy provides valuable insights into the process of spatial localization and can help identify circumstances in which spatially chaotic deformations can occur.
