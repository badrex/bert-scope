tldr: The author, Everard Home, corrects misconceptions about narwhale tusks. He explains that the perfect narwhale has only one tusk, which is always in the left socket. The tusk is found only in male narwhales, not females. This fact was confirmed by comparing male and female skulls. The author also notes that the tusk is not a distinctive character for the species, as previously believed.
