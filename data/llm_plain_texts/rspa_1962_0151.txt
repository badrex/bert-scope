tldr: The authors re-examine the Landau-Zener formula, which describes the probability of electronic jumps near the crossing point of two potential energy curves in molecules. They present a new formula for different cases of transitions and discuss the limitations of the original formula. The study focuses on internal conversion, predissociation, and scattering problems in molecular physics.
