tldr: The authors discuss the difficulties with the ionic recombination theory in the ionized layers of the upper atmosphere and explore alternative theories, such as the dust particle recombination theory. They analyze the processes of recombination and electron attachment in the presence of positively and negatively charged dust particles, concluding that the dust particle recombination theory may provide an enhancement of the recombination rate in the ionized layers.
