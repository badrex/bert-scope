tldr: The Pioneer Venus mission provided valuable insights into the composition, structure, and dynamics of Venus's atmosphere. Infrared remote sensing data from the orbiter revealed the temperature and cloud structure of the atmosphere, providing information on the planet's circulation regime, thermal tides, and the reversed equator-to-pole temperature gradient. These findings help to understand the differences between Venus and Earth's atmospheres and contribute to the study of planetary atmospheres in general.
