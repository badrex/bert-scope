revised_title: 'Non-Existence of Path Integrals in Stochastic Calculus'
semantic_tags:
  - Stochastic Calculus
  - Path Integrals
  - Brownian Motion
  - Stratonovich Integral
  - Ito Integral
tldr: This article demonstrates the non-existence of path integrals in stochastic calculus, specifically for classes of paths involving brownian motions. It also discusses the limitations of the Stratonovich and Ito integrals and the importance of considering the pair in a strong way for a theory rich enough to discuss situations arising in stochastic integration.
