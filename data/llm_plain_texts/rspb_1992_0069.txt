tldr: The article explores the interaction of avidin with the lipoyl domains in the pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex. It reveals the three-dimensional location of these domains and their similarity to biotinyl domains in carboxylases. The study provides insights into the structure and function of these domains and their role in enzyme activity.
