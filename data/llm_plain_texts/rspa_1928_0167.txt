tldr: This article investigates the partial osmotic pressures and membrane equilibria in protein systems, focusing on the effects of salts and other ions on protein behavior. The author presents two methods for calculating partial pressures and discusses the relationship between osmotic pressure and protein concentration. The study provides insights into the behavior of proteins in biological systems and has implications for understanding protein function and interactions.
