tldr: This article explores the Cherenkov ray cones in crystalline media, focusing on the distinction between wave-normal cones and ray cones. The authors develop equations for ray cones emitted by a charge moving in an arbitrary direction in a uniaxial crystal and study the Cherenkov analogue of internal conical refraction in biaxial crystals. The research provides a better understanding of the shape and behavior of Cherenkov rings on a photographic plate, which can be applied to various scientific experiments and crystal optics studies.
