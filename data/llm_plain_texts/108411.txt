tldr: The author investigates the interior structure of the Earth and its surface phenomena, focusing on the relationship between the fluid nucleus and the solid crust. They explore the effects of molecular forces, pressures, and friction at the surface of contact between the shell and nucleus, and discuss the implications for the Earth's rotation and the potential for tidal oscillations.
