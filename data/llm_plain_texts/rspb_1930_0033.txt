tldr: The authors developed a new method to section plant fibers chemically, which provides valuable diagnostic information for the textile industry. By tendering the fibers with acid and mounting them in caustic soda, they can create natural sections that reveal the fiber's structure and help identify different types of plant fibers. This technique offers a rapid and simple way to analyze plant fibers, providing insights into their composition and arrangement.
