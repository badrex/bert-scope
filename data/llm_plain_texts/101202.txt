tldr: The author, Christopher Merret, conducted experiments on grafting tree bark and found that it successfully united with the tree during the spring season. He observed that the sap's movement played a crucial role in the grafting process, and it was unsuccessful during the winter season. The experiments also showed that withering of branches occurred when grafting was unsuccessful.
