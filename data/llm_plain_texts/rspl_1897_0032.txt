tldr: The author investigates the sensory nerves in eye and other muscles, specifically focusing on muscle spindles and tendon organs. They discover that the absence of Kuhne-Ruffini "spindles" does not exclude the presence of sensorial end-organs and afferent nerve fibers. The author also suggests that the oculomotor and trochlear cranial nerves may be sensori-motor rather than purely motor nerves.
