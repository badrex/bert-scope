tldr: The author, Joseph Jackson Lister, discusses the principles of achromatic object-glasses and their application to microscopes. He describes the construction of an instrument with adjustable magnification from 35 to 800 diameters and emphasizes the importance of light management. Lister also addresses optical illusions and fallacies that can occur during microscopy and provides a method for measuring object dimensions. Lastly, he reviews the merits of various microscopes and introduces a principle that could lead to further improvements in microscope technology.
