tldr: The authors investigated the performance of the Rayleigh disk, a tool used to measure sound intensity, and found that the torque on the disk is affected by factors such as the disk's thickness, lack of infinite inertia, diffraction of sound, and the proximity of enclosing tubes. They studied these factors and their impact on the torque, providing a better understanding of the Rayleigh disk's behavior in various conditions.
