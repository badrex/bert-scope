tldr: The authors present a quantum mechanical theory of absorption and fluorescence in thin molecular crystals. They develop a second quantized Hamiltonian to describe the interaction between molecules and the electromagnetic field, and use the Bogolyubov-Tyablikov method to diagonalize the Hamiltonian. The theory considers the internal and external fields, and treats absorption and fluorescence separately. This work provides a better understanding of the interaction of radiation with molecular crystals and helps in predicting their optical properties.
