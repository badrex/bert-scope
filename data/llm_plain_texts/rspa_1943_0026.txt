revised_title: 'Euler's Theorem and the Summation of Infinite Harmonic Series'
semantic_tags:
  - Harmonic series
  - Euler's theorem
  - Infinite series
  - Trigonometry
  - Mathematical analysis
tldr: The author explores three infinite harmonic series and their sums, with a focus on Euler's theorem. They demonstrate that these series can be summed and are simple, self-contained periodic circular functions. The author also discusses the historical context and the work of Newton and Leibniz in relation to these series.
