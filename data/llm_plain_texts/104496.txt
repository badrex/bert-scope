tldr: The author, Cromwell Mortimer, discusses the natural heat of animals and proposes that it is generated by phosphoreal and aereal particles in animal fluids. He explains that the heart and arteries play a role in exciting this heat through the circulation of fluids, which brings phosphoreal and aereal particles into contact, generating heat. Mortimer also mentions the potential dangers of phosphoreal principles in animals and the possibility of using electricity for medical purposes to renew vital fire.
