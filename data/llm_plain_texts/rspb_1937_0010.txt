revised_title: 'The Chemical Sense Used by Trichogramma to Distinguish Parasitized and Unparasitized Hosts'

tldr: The author investigates how the parasitoid wasp Trichogramma distinguishes between parasitized and unparasitized hosts. They find that the wasps use their chemical sense to detect a deterrent odor provided by the parasite, rather than a specific smell from the host itself. This discovery helps to understand the complex communication and behavior of these insects in their natural environment.
