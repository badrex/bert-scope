tldr: The article describes the unique buoyancy mechanism of the octopod Ocythoe tuberculata, which possesses a swimbladder and triple jets. The swimbladder helps control buoyancy, while the accessory funnels, or jets, enable the octopus to swim and maneuver in various directions. This adaptation allows the octopus to live a nektonic life in open waters, where it is preyed upon by top predators like swordfish.
