revised_title: Investigating Daily Temperature Variations on Earth's Surface
semantic_tags:
  - Earth's temperature
  - Atmospheric conduction
  - Isothermal lines
  - Friction and rotation
  - Electrical agency
tldr: The author, S.M. Drach, examines the factors affecting daily temperature variations on Earth's surface. They introduce the concept of "Thermed establishment" to describe the delay in solar light effects due to atmospheric conduction and local circumstances. Drach explains the formation of tables and diagrams, discusses perturbing causes, and explores the role of friction from Earth's rotation and electrical agency in temperature changes.
