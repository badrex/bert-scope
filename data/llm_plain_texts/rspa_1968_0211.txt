tldr: This article investigates the one-phonon band-mode absorption spectra activated by various impurities in silicon and diamond. The authors observe absorption features attributed to in-band resonances and discuss the limitations of the isotopic-defect theory of Dawber and Elliott. They also find a specific absorption peak near the Raman energy in doped silicon and diamonds with different types of defects.
