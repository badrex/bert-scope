tldr: This article presents radiofrequency studies of TmVO4, focusing on the magnetic susceptibility and cooperative Jahn-Teller interactions in the crystal structure. The electronic ground state of the Tm ion is a non-Kramers doublet, which is split by a cooperative Jahn-Teller distortion. The measurements establish the behavior of the magnetic susceptibility and provide insights into the temperature at which the Tm nuclear moments may enter an ordered phase.
