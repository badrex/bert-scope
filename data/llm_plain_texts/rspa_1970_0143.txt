tldr: This article discusses the concept of duality in elementary particle processes, where the scattering amplitude can be expanded in terms of resonance states or Regge exchange. The author introduces the duality conjecture, which implies a strong interrelationship between the properties of resonances and Reggeons, and explores its implications and developments in the field. The article also touches upon the Veneziano amplitude and its significance in the duality conjecture.
