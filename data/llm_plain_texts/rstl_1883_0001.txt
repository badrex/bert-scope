tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the influence of stress and strain on the action of physical forces in various metals. They discovered that the elasticity of a wire increases with time after permanent extension, and this increase is more significant for greater loads. This finding indicates a departure from Hooke's law, which states that the extension of a wire is directly proportional to the load applied to it.
