tldr: This article investigates the iron-carbon system and characterizes a new iron carbide. The author compares the carbides obtained through new methods with those prepared by previous methods, leading to the identification of iron percarbide and cementite. The study also explores the stability of these carbides and their decomposition at various temperatures.
