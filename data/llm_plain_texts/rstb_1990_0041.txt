tldr: The authors investigated the dynamics of the wing beat in Drosophila melanogaster by calculating the forces acting on the wings using three-dimensional kinematic data. They found that the conventional aerodynamic theories, which assume quasi-steady aerodynamics, do not account for the hovering flight performance of small insects. The results support the notion that flight in small insects might be dominated by unsteady mechanisms.
