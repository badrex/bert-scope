tldr: This article discusses the theoretical and practical aspects of uranium geology, focusing on finding uranium provinces and understanding the various concepts and models involved in uranium exploration. The authors provide a set of criteria for identifying potential uranium deposits and describe different types of uranium ore formations, such as conglomerates, palaeosurface-related vein-type deposits, sandstone deposits, and others. They also emphasize the importance of evaluating exploration areas based on the presence of indispensable conditions for ore formation and preservation.
