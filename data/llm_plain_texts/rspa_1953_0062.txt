tldr: The authors conducted an experimental study on the velocity of combination of iodine atoms in the presence of various added gases to investigate factors influencing energy transfer. They found that the reaction is second-order with respect to iodine atoms and first-order with respect to the third body. The efficiency of different additives is determined by their intermolecular force fields, which are reflected in their boiling points and critical temperatures. The study provides insights into the factors affecting energy transfer in gas-phase reactions.
