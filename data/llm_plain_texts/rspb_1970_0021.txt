tldr: The authors studied the structure and development of the compensation sac (ascus) in two types of ascophoran bryozoans, Schizoporella and Umbonula. They found that the frontal walls of both species have asymmetrical structures, contrary to the Harmer-Silen growth model. The authors also discovered differences in the location and timing of epithelial fusion processes that influence ascus development in each species. This research provides insights into the feeding apparatus and protrusion mechanisms of bryozoans.
