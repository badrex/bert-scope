tldr: 'This study investigates the factors affecting aerobic capacity in 46 healthy young adults aged 18 to 28 years. The research focuses on anthropometric data, physiological measurements, and exercise performance. The study found that maximal oxygen uptake is related to body potassium, limb muscle, and forced vital capacity. The results provide a means to analyze the contributions to human exercise performance, body size, and the effects of the environment.'
