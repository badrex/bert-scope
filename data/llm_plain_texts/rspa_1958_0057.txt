tldr: The authors propose a resonance model for pion production in nucleon-nucleon collisions at low energies. They assume that the production occurs in a few angular momentum states and that the matrix element remains constant, except for factors due to final-state pion-nucleon and nucleon-nucleon interactions. The model successfully fits most of the experimental data on pion production, including total and differential cross-sections, up to 660 MeV.
