tldr: Francis Galton's study on family likeness in eye-color examines the hereditary patterns of eye color in families. He found that the possession of a unit of peculiarity in a man implies the existence of an average of one-third of that peculiarity in his parents and one-third in each of his children. The study also shows that eye color appears to be less variable in its origin compared to stature, but the shares of hereditary contribution from various ancestors are alike in both cases.
