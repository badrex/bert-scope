tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the effect of anterior pituitary extracts on established lactation in cows. They found that a single injection of crude anterior pituitary extracts caused a temporary increase in milk yield, while daily injections of prolactin had a more significant impact on milk production. The study also highlighted the importance of considering the composition of the milk secreted during these experiments.
