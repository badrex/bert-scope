tldr: The authors present a new class of solutions for the Einstein-Maxwell equations that describe the collision of impulsive gravitational waves and electromagnetic shock-waves in a conformally flat space-time. They find that these solutions develop horizons and time-like singularities, providing a generalization of the Bell-Szekeres solution. This work contributes to the understanding of the behavior of space-time in extreme conditions and has implications for astrophysics and the study of black holes.
