tldr: Researchers have developed a new technique called proton-electron double-resonance imaging (PEDRI) to visualize free radicals in living rats. This method combines proton imaging with nuclear electron double resonance and can track the progress of nitroxide free radicals injected into the bloodstream. The technique has potential applications in biology and medicine, such as studying disease states and pharmacokinetic studies.
