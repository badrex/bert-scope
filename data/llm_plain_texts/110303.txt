tldr: The author observed the changes in the Mediterranean volcano's crater since his last communication to the Royal Society. He found that the crater has undergone several changes in form and has now entirely disappeared. He inferred that the crater was formed by volcanic action and was composed of loose materials, not a bed of the sea.
