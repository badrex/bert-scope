tldr: The authors investigate the adsorption of hydrogen on the surface of an electrodeless discharge tube, focusing on the maintenance of a monomolecular layer and the liberation of recombined atoms with energy emission. They explore the energy exchange between the gas and solid phases and determine the conditions under which the layer's constituents can leave it. This research helps to understand the processes involved in adsorption and desorption of hydrogen.
