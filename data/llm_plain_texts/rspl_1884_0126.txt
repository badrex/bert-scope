tldr: The author investigated the prevalence of Echinococcus, a dangerous tapeworm, in domestic dogs in various parts of Australia. The study found a high prevalence of the parasite in stray dogs, which explained the serious prevalence of hydatid disease in the localities where investigation was made. The author also discussed the possible reasons for the higher prevalence of the tapeworm in Australian dogs compared to English or Icelandic dogs.
