tldr: Researchers determined the structure of rabbit phosphoglucomutase, an enzyme that converts glucose-1-phosphate to glucose-6-phosphate. They grew large crystals and used X-ray diffraction to study the enzyme's structure and active site. The enzyme remained active in the crystals, allowing the researchers to study its function as well. This work provides insights into the structure and function of an important enzyme in glycolysis.
