tldr: The author, Thomas Molyneux, examines a massive skull in the Medicine School at Leyden and estimates that the individual it belonged to was at least twice as tall as the average man, making them a prodigious figure. Molyneux discusses the dimensions of the skull and compares it to other skulls, concluding that it is highly unlikely that such a large skull belonged to a man of ordinary stature.
