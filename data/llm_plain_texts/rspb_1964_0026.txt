tldr: The authors provide a detailed description of the structure and innervation of the sensory epithelia of the labyrinth in the Thornback ray. They use electron microscopy to study the ultrastructural organization of sensory hair cells and their hair processes, as well as the supporting cells. The findings are related to the known mode of function of the sensory epithelia, providing insights into the anatomy and physiology of the labyrinth in this species.
