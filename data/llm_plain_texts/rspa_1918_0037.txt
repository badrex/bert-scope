tldr: This article investigates the absorption of X-rays and the atomic absorption coefficients of various elements. The authors found that elements can be grouped into categories where the atomic absorption coefficient is directly proportional to the atomic number. They also studied the effect of X-ray scattering on absorption coefficients and discussed the differences between fluorescent and scattering absorption coefficients.
