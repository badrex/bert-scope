tldr: The authors conducted experiments on dogs to study the effects of cobra venom on proteid metabolism. They found that cobra venom had a slight toxic action on the hepatic metabolism, leading to a decrease in urea elaboration and an increase in the proportion of nitrogen excreted as ammonia. This suggests that the venom primarily affects the nervous system rather than having a general impact on proteid changes.
