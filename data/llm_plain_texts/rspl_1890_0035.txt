tldr: The author, Charles Tomlinson, studied the effect of oils on the motions of camphor on the surface of water. He found that a film of certain oils could stop the camphor motions on the water surface, while other oils, like volatile oils and creosote, did not impede the motion. By focusing on chemical purity, Tomlinson explained various phenomena related to camphor motions and their underlying molecular interactions.
