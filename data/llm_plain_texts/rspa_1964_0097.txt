tldr: The authors studied the crystal and molecular structure of a cobalt complex, (CF3)4C5O.C5H5.Co, using X-ray analysis. They found a system of cr- and π-bonding from the cyclopentadienone ligand to the cobalt atom. The crystal structure revealed a non-planarity of the cyclopentadienone ring, with a tilt angle of 21.3°. The study provides insights into the bonding and molecular interactions in organometallic complexes.
