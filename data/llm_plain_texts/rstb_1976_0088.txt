tldr: This study examines the genetic basis of shell pattern polymorphism in the prosobranch snail Clithon (Pictoneritina) oualaniensis, which is widely distributed in the Indo-Pacific region. The research is based on extensive collections from Hong Kong, Malaya, Singapore, and Ceylon, and includes the results of some breeding experiments. The findings suggest that the polymorphism is maintained by selection, and that the array of variability may be adaptively neutral. The study provides insights into the genetic and environmental factors influencing the shell patterns of this snail species.
