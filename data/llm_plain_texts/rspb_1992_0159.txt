tldr: The authors expressed four cloned subunits of the NMDA receptor in pairs in Xenopus oocytes and measured their single-channel properties. They found that the NR1-NR2A and NR1-NR2B combinations have similar conductances and sublevel transitions, resembling native NMDA receptors in hippocampal and cerebellar cells. The NR1-NR2C combination produces a channel with different conductances, closely resembling channels found in large cerebellar neurons.
