tldr: The author describes the discovery and analysis of Baluchitherium osborni, a large, aberrant mammal with elephantine size and unique skeletal features. The animal had a heavy body, pillar-like limbs, and a long neck, making it one of the largest land mammals known at the time. The author compares its skeletal structure to other Perissodactyles, such as horses and rhinoceroses, and discusses the variations in its atlas and cervical vertebrae.
