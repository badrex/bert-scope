tldr: The authors conducted an experiment to study the compound formation in binary fatty-acid mixtures using X-ray diffractometry. They found that long and short crystal spacings showed significant changes in relation to the composition of the mixtures, while spacings remained almost unchanged. The changes in spacings indicate limited intersolubility of the component fatty acids and partial compound formation. This research helps to understand the peculiar shape of solidification point curves of binary systems formed by adjacent even-numbered acids.
