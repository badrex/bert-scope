tldr: The authors studied the development of teeth in reptiles and amphibians, specifically in newts, frogs, and lizards. They discovered that the previously accepted "papillary stage" of tooth development does not exist in these animals. Instead, teeth develop within a specific area in the mouth, surrounded by dense connective tissue. The process involves the formation of enamel and dentine organs, which are connected to the oral epithelium. The tooth sacs travel with the developing teeth as they replace their predecessors.
