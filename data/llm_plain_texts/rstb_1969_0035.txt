tldr: The Royal Society expedition to the British Solomon Islands Protectorate in 1965 explored various aspects of the islands' flora, fauna, and geology. The team discovered high levels of endemism in plant species, studied the impact of environmental factors on forest ecosystems, and discussed the origins of island life. The findings challenged existing scientific theories and provided new insights into the complex history and evolution of the islands.
