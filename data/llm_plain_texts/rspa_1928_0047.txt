tldr: 'The author explains how Sommerfeld's electron theory of metals can be used to understand the photoelectric threshold frequency and the thermionic work function. They demonstrate that the energy corresponding to the threshold frequency is equal to the thermionic work function, and discuss the distribution of electrons in metals and their relation to the photoelectric effect.'
