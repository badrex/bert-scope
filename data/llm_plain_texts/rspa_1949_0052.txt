tldr: This article explores the structure of one-dimensional flames and how it is determined by constants such as heat conductivity, diffusion, and homogeneous reaction rates. The authors provide mathematical solutions for simplified models, considering unimolecular, bimolecular, and quasibimolecular reaction types. These solutions help in understanding the variation of composition and temperature through the flame.
