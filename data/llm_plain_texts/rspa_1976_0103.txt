semantic_tags:

  - Optics
tldr: The authors discuss the use of the theory of entire functions to solve the phase problem in scattering phenomena, image analysis, radio astronomy, and coherence theory. They introduce the logarithmic Hilbert transform and analyze its applicability, focusing on one-dimensional situations and quasi-monochromatic fields.
