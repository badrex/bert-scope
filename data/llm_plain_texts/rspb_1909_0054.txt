tldr: The author investigates the accuracy and limitations of Sachs' dry-weight method for measuring photosynthesis in leaves. They find that the method is not entirely reliable due to errors from asymmetry and changes in leaf area. However, they conclude that with improvements, the method can still be useful for measuring total photosynthetic activity in leaves under natural conditions.
