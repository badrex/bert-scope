tldr: Honeybees can see at night by using neural image enhancement and visual summation. They improve light capture by summing photons in space and time, which allows them to see coarse images in moonlight. This discovery explains how bees and other insects with typical day-active eye design can adopt a nocturnal lifestyle.
