tldr: The author observes the structure of the epiploon, a double membrane covering animal entrails filled with fat. They discover that fat is stored in small sacks within the membrane and is transported throughout the body via adipous vessels. The author suggests that fat plays a role in moderating the acidity of the blood and serosities, and that lean individuals may be more susceptible to diseases related to sharp humors due to the lack of fat.
