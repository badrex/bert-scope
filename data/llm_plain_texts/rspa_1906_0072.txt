tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the production of secondary rays by α rays from polonium. They discovered that a magnetic field could prevent negatively charged particles from reaching a plate, and that the positive current from one plate to another consisted of two parts: a stream of α particles and a stream of negatively charged particles. This research provided insights into the behavior of particles under electric and magnetic fields.
