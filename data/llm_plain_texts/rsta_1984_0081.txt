tldr: This article discusses the formation of the early Solar System and the rotation of the Sun. The author presents two models for the formation process: an outward evolving disc and an inward-spiralling disc. The author argues that the inward-spiralling disc model better accounts for the uneven distribution of angular momentum, the tilt of the Sun's axis, and the chemical and isotopic composition of the Solar System. The author also suggests that the low angular momentum of the Sun and other low mass stars may be due to a slow build-up as a degenerate dwarf, acquiring orbital material at a low specific angular momentum.
