tldr: The author, C.F. Varley, conducted experiments with magneto-electric machines and discovered that adding a shunt to the electromagnet increases the power. He also found that the force expended in the shunt is wasted in heat, and suggested using a secondary wire or a copper cylinder to maintain magnetism and increase power. Varley discussed the differences between Wilde's, Wheatstone's, and Siemens's machines and proposed his own improvements.
