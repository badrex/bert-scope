tldr: This article discusses the author's attempt to determine the direction of the solar system's proper motion using the apparent proper motions of stars in the southern hemisphere. The author compares observations made by Lacaille, Johnson, and Henderson to calculate the direction of the sun's motion. The results indicate that the sun is moving towards a specific point in the sky, providing valuable information about the solar system's motion.
