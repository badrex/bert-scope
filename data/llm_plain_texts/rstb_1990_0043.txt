tldr: The article investigates the role of amine oxidases in the regulation of embryonal carcinoma cells and their differentiation. It demonstrates that blastocoele fluid contains a toxic factor that selectively kills cells with trophectodermal potential, leading to cell death and tissue renewal. This finding has implications for understanding programmed cell death and tissue renewal mechanisms in the embryo and adult organisms.
