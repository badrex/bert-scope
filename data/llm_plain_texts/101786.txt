tldr: This article describes the process of hatching chickens in Cairo, observed by Mr. John Graves and communicated by Sr. George Ent. The chickens are hatched in ovens using camel or buffalo dung as fuel. The eggs are placed in the ovens for 14 days and nights before being moved to the upper ovens, where they are turned four times a day. The hatched chickens are then placed in the lower ovens covered with mats and straw for drying and standing. The article also provides a ground plan of the house and ovens used for this process.
