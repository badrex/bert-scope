tldr: The author presents a new method for testing hypotheses in frequency distributions, focusing on cases where the hypothetical formula contains unknown constants that need to be determined from the data. The method improves upon previous methods by considering the errors as a whole and addressing potential issues with small frequencies at the extremities of the range.
