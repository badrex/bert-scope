tldr: This study investigates the development of muscle cholinesterase in aneural and control embryonic rat diaphragm muscles. The results show that in aneural muscles, cholinesterase deposits develop in their normal positions, but with a fainter histochemical reaction than in controls. Muscles denervated at day 16 of gestation have junctional deposits with a more normal histological appearance, but also have many extra-junctional deposits scattered across the muscle. The study suggests that the relationship between ACh receptor clusters, cholinesterase deposits, and nerve terminals may reflect the presence of an organizing substructure that coordinates their differentiation within developing skeletal muscles.
