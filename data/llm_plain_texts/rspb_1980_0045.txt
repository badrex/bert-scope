tldr: The authors discovered electrical synapses between motoneurons in the spinal cord of newborn rats. They found that these electrical interactions were responsible for small, short-latency depolarizations in the motoneurons when stimulated. This suggests that electrical synapses play a significant role in the communication between motoneurons in newborn rats.
