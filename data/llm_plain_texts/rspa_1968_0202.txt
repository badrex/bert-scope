tldr: This article explores the spatial autocorrelation functions of intensity and phase fluctuations in a plane parallel to the wave front of an incident wave when passing through a non-absorbing medium with random irregularities. The study focuses on multiple scattering and its effects on radio signals from stellar sources, providing valuable information about the scattering medium causing the scintillations.
