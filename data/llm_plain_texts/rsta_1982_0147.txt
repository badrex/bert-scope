tldr: This article discusses the formation of carbon-carbon bonds at dinuclear metal centers, specifically diruthenium complexes, and their potential role in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis of hydrocarbons. The authors describe various reactions and mechanisms, including the combination of carbenes, carbynes, alkynes, and olefins at the diruthenium center, which could help explain the wide spectrum of hydrocarbon products in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis.
