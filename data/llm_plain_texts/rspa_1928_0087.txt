revised_title: 'Effect of Surrounding Air Pressure on Frictional Electricity'
semantic_tags:
  - Frictional electricity
  - Surface charge
  - Air pressure
  - Insulators
  - Dielectric constants
tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effect of surrounding air pressure on the generation of frictional electricity. They discovered that the magnitude of the charge produced is largely dependent on the pressure of the surrounding air, with charges significantly reduced at low pressures. This effect was observed with various insulators and dielectric materials.
