semantic_tags:
  - Chromatin structure

  - Non-histone proteins
  - DNA organization
tldr: The article discusses the structure of eukaryotic chromosomes and chromatin, focusing on the different types of mononucleosomes and their properties. The authors discover a third type of mononucleosome (MN3) that is more resistant to nuclease digestion and contains non-histone proteins. This finding contributes to the understanding of chromatin structure and organization.
