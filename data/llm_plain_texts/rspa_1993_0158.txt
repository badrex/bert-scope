tldr: The author proposes a precise definition of conformal singularities in classical general relativity, considering Big Bang singularities that can be conformally transformed to a spacelike hypersurface. The study assumes that the conformal factor and conformal metric are both smooth, leading to the conclusion that the adiabatic index of the fluid must tend to 4/3 at the singularity, indicating a highly relativistic initial state.
