tldr: This article discusses the evolution and environment of lower Palaeozoic sporomorphs, focusing on their stratigraphical distribution and possible affinities to early bryophytic ancestors. The author examines the similarities between Silurian and early Devonian spores and those of modern mosses and liverworts, suggesting that many of these spores may have belonged to early bryophytic ancestors. The study also highlights the major discrepancy between the number of dispersed Silurian and Lower Devonian miospore species and the few species of land plants known.
