tldr: This study investigates the relationship between meteor luminosity and ionization by conducting photographic and radio echo observations. The results show a scatter larger than expected due to inherent differences in the meteors observed. The ratio of luminosity to ionization is found to be a function of meteor brightness, velocity, and other parameters. The authors provide values for ionizing efficiency and probability of ionization for a mean photographic magnitude and velocity.
