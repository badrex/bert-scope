tldr: The article examines the structure and function of the proboscis apparatus in the nemertine Lineus ruber. The proboscis is divided into three segments and is connected to the retractor muscle. The study uses electron microscopy to analyze the different cell types and their roles in the proboscis, including rhabdite-forming cells, sensory cells, and mucus-secreting cells. The proboscis is used for capturing prey, defense, burrowing, and locomotion.
