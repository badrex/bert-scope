tldr: The authors conducted experiments on isolated frog muscles to study the relationship between the speed of muscle contraction and the work performed. They discovered that the force exerted by the muscle decreases as the speed of shortening increases, and proposed an elastic-viscous model to explain this phenomenon. This model helps to understand the nature of muscular contraction and the mechanical efficiency of muscles.
