tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments using photoelectric cells to measure the penetration of light of various wavelengths into the sea. They used emission and rectifier cells to study the effects of color filters and different resistances on the measurements. Their findings provide valuable insights into the energy available for photosynthesis in different spectral bands at various depths, contributing to the understanding of marine ecosystems.'
