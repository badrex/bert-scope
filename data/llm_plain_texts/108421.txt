tldr: The author, Professor Owen, discusses the exogenous processes of vertebrae in mammals and their variations across different species. He proposes a new nomenclature for these processes, including terms such as parapophysis, diapophysis, and metapophysis, to provide a clearer and more accurate description of the complex bones in extinct species like the Megatherium. This research is essential for understanding the anatomy and evolution of vertebrates.
