tldr: The author, John Mudge, shares his method for creating the best composition for reflecting telescope speculums. He describes the process of grinding, polishing, and giving the speculum the true parabolic curve. Mudge's composition consists of 14 ounces and a half of grain-tin to two pounds of Swedish copper, resulting in a beautiful white and very hard metal. He also explains how to prevent pores in the metal, which can affect the speculum's performance.
