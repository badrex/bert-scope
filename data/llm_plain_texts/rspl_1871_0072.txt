tldr: The authors, Urban Pritchard and Lionel Beale, study the structure and function of the cochlea rods in humans and mammals. They describe the rods as being similar to piano hammers and explain their varying lengths and shapes. The cochlea, they argue, works like a musical instrument, with the rods representing the strings of a harp or the teeth of a musical box. The rods vibrate when sounds or vibrations pass through the cochlea, causing nerve-cells to send nerve-currents to the brain for interpretation.
