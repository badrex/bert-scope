tldr: This study investigates the factors affecting evaporation from open water, bare soil, and grass, focusing on the energy balance and sink strength. The authors propose a combination of aerodynamic and energy-based approaches to estimate evaporation rates using standard meteorological data. Experimental results show that the energy balance method is successful, and the evaporation rates from wet bare soil and turf are obtained as fractions of that from open water.
