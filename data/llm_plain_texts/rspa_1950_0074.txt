tldr: The authors investigate the external gravitational and electromagnetic fields of rotating bodies, focusing on the possibility of a rotating body producing an electromagnetic field. They find that a rotating body does produce an electromagnetic field, specifically a field of the form proposed by Blackett, but other alternative fields may exist. The analysis also shows that a rotating mass of liquid under isotropic pressure can produce an electromagnetic field satisfying certain conditions.
