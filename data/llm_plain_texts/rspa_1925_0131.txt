tldr: This study investigates the electrical conductivity of dilute solutions of uni-univalent salts in methyl alcohol at 25°C. The authors used a precise method to measure conductivity and minimize errors, providing accurate data for the relationship between conductivity and concentration. The results confirm two known laws related to the behavior of electrolytes in solution and contribute to a more complete understanding of the nature of solutions.
