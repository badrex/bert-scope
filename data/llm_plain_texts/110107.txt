tldr: The author examines the changes that have occurred in ancient copper alloys found in artifacts such as helmets, nails, and mirrors. They observe the formation of crystalline structures and discuss the possible causes, including chemical affinity, electro-chemical attraction, and attraction of aggregation. This study may help explain phenomena in mineralogy and geology.
