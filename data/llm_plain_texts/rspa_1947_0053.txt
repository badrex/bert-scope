tldr: The authors investigated the effect of environment on the polymerization processes of vinyl acetate in ethyl acetate and n-hexane solutions. They found that the reaction rate in both cases is proportional to the monomer concentration and the square root of the light intensity. The ethyl acetate solutions allowed the polymer to remain extended, while n-hexane caused precipitation and a 'gel' effect. The results confirmed present theories on the cause of the gel stage in polymerization processes.
