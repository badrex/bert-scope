tldr: The article investigates the emission of light by flames containing sodium and the absorption of light by mercury vapour. The author explains Gouy's square root law of emission by considering the absorption of light by sodium atoms in the flame. The experimental results support the view that atoms absorb light like simple damped oscillators.
