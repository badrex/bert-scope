tldr: The author investigates the mechanism controlling the positions of vascular cambium regeneration in plants. They propose a gradient induction hypothesis based on two diffusible morphogens, auxin and sucrose, which create a concentration gradient across the cambium. The ratio of auxin to sucrose concentration determines the position and orientation of the regenerating cambium, restoring the normal pattern of vascular tissues in the stem. This hypothesis explains various patterns of vascular differentiation observed in different plant situations.
