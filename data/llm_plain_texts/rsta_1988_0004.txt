tldr: This article presents the first experimental determination of the dipole moment of a molecular ion from the rotational Zeeman effect. The authors used tunable far-infrared laser spectroscopy to measure the rotational factors of molecular ions and determine their dipole moments. The method provides a direct experimental route to a previously unavailable quantity for molecular ions, with potential for precision of about 0.1 in future measurements.
