revised_title: Drift and Diffusion of Positive Ions in Hydrogen: A New Apparatus and Experimental Results
semantic_tags:
  - Ion drift
  - Gas physics
  - Ion mobility
  - Gas diffusion
  - Ion sources
tldr: The authors present a redesigned apparatus to measure the drift velocity and the ratio of drift velocity to diffusion coefficient for positive ions in hydrogen. They discuss the experimental setup, results, and the influence of the oscillating voltage on the ions. The findings contribute to the understanding of ion drift and diffusion in gases, particularly in hydrogen.
