tldr: The authors determined the crystal structure of anthranilic acid's lower-temperature form using X-ray diffraction. They discovered two nonequivalent molecules per lattice point in the space group P21cn, with one molecule being neutral and the other a zwitterion. The study also revealed differences in bond lengths and bond angles between the two molecules, indicating their distinct structures. This research contributes to understanding the relationship between crystal structure and polymorphism in anthranilic acid.
