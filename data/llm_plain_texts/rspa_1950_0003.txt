tldr: The authors discuss the manufacturing methods and factors affecting the gelling characteristics of aluminium soaps. They describe three methods of making aluminium soaps and analyze the effects of manufacturing techniques, structure, and peptizers on the gelling properties in hydrocarbon solvents. The study also highlights the importance of controlling pH, temperature, and the use of protective colloids in obtaining a consistent product.
