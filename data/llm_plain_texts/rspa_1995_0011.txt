tldr: The authors derive optimal bounds correlating the electric, magnetic, and thermal properties of two-phase, two-dimensional composites. These bounds are important for testing experimental results, approximation theories, and can help in the design of structures. The main tool used in this derivation is a new fractional linear transformation that preserves several important analytic properties.
