tldr: The author discusses the use of mouse teratocarcinoma as a model system for studying cellular differentiation in early mammalian embryonic development. Teratocarcinomas contain embryonic carcinoma cells that can differentiate into various cell types from the three germ layers. This model system helps overcome the challenges of studying early embryonic development due to the scarcity and heterogeneity of the material. The author also explains the properties and characteristics of embryonic carcinoma cells and their potential for understanding cellular differentiation and cancer development.
