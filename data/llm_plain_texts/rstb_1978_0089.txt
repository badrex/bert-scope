revised_title: The Role of Polyprenyl Phosphates in Plant Protein and Oligosaccharide Glycosylation
semantic_tags:
  - Glycosylation
  - Polyprenyl phosphate
  - Protein glycosylation
  - Oligosaccharide glycosylation
  - Plant biochemistry
tldr: The article discusses the biochemical functions of terpenoids in plants, specifically polyprenyl phosphates acting as coenzymes in protein and oligosaccharide glycosylation. Dolichyl phosphates are found to be involved in glycosyl transfer in all plant members studied. The process of O- and N-glycosylation of proteins in yeasts and hyphal fungi is also explored, with similarities to that found in green plants. The antibiotic tunicamycin is shown to inhibit the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine phosphate, blocking protein N-glycosylation.
