tldr: The author conducted an investigation into the efficiency of wood as a water-conducting tissue in various tree and shrub species. They developed a method to measure the water flow through a twig's wood and found that the efficiency of water-conductivity can be quantitatively expressed for each species. The study also aimed to determine if the mean conductivity can be correlated with the deciduous or evergreen habit of plants and whether external conditions can affect water-conductivity.
