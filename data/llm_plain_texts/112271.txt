  - Leucic acid
  - Oxalic acid
tldr: The author, Edward Frankland, describes the synthesis of leucic acid ether from oxalic ether and zincethyl. He also discusses the properties of leucic acid ether, its reaction with solutions of baryta and potash, and the production of leucic acid from oxalic acid. This process provides insight into the molecular constitution of organic acids like lactic acid.
