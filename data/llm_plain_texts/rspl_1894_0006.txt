tldr: The authors present corrections to their previous work on the mechanical equivalent of heat and discuss further experiments. They address errors in arithmetic and provide an updated value for the temperature coefficient J. The authors also examine the consequences of continuous transition between different refractive media and compare their findings with existing theories and experiments.
