tldr: This article investigates the role of granitic intrusions in reducing the density of the Earth's crust using a gravity study of the Cuddapah Basin in India. The study reveals a gravity 'low' over the east Cuddapah Basin, which is likely caused by massive granitic intrusions. The findings suggest that granitic intrusions can locally reduce the density of the crust and have implications for the basin's tectonics, mineralization, isostasy, and the understanding of the Earth's crust.
