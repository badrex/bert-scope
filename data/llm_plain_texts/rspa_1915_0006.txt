tldr: This article discusses the problem of electromagnetic wave propagation in a perfectly conducting tube. The authors assume the tube to be an infinite right cylindrical shape with a perfect conductor material and an empty or air-filled interior. They focus on axially symmetrical, permanent-type waves and analyze the mathematical and physical aspects of the phenomenon.
