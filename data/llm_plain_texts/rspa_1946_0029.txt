tldr: The authors studied the dissociation constants of carboxyl and hydroxyl groups in various insoluble and sol-forming polysaccharides. They found that the dissociation constants can be evaluated for substances in the solid state, and demonstrated that these constants are the same whether the substance remains undissolved or forms a sol. The study provides a method for analyzing buffer action and opens the way for similar investigations of more complex substances.
