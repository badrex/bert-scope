revised_title: 'Analyzing Dependencies in Ion Channel Kinetics'
semantic_tags:

tldr: The authors present a method to analyze the dependencies of adjacent open and closed intervals in ion channels, which can help determine the connections among various kinetic states. They demonstrate this method using a simulated single-channel current record and discuss the implications for understanding ion channel gating processes.
