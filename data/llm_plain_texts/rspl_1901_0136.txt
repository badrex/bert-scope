tldr: The authors discovered a pair of ciliated grooves in the brain of the Ammocete that may play a role in promoting the circulation of fluid in the brain cavity. These grooves are lined with a unique columnar epithelium and are found in the root of the brain near the posterior commissure. The authors suggest that these grooves may aid in gaseous interchange and respiration for nerve cells, which is essential for their survival and function.
