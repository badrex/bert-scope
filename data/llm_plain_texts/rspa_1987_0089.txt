tldr: The authors propose a theory that explains the elasticity of particle assemblies by considering the adhesion between particles due to molecular attractions. They show that the effective Young's modulus of a regular cubic packing of spheres depends on the contacts between individual particles and the interfacial attractive energy between the spheres. This method provides a direct way to measure the surface energy of solids. The authors experimentally verify this theory and apply it to determine the surface energies of various powders, such as zirconia, titania, alumina, and silica.
