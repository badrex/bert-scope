tldr: William Burnet and his team observed the eclipses of Jupiter's first satellite to determine the longitude of New York. They used Mr. Pound's tables and their own observations to calculate the time differences and the longitude. The team also observed the variation of the magnetic needle, which helped in understanding the Earth's magnetic field.
