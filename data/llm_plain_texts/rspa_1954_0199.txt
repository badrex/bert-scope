tldr: The article discusses the mathematical analysis of non-steady countercurrent transfer processes in chemical engineering, focusing on mass and heat transfer between two streams in a column. The authors present a method to solve the differential equations involved and provide a general solution for various boundary conditions. The study is particularly relevant to distillation processes, absorption, and extraction in packed towers.
