tldr: The author conducted a series of experiments to decompose muriatic acid using electric shocks. The experiments showed that the water content in muriatic acid gas was decomposed, but the acid itself did not decompose. The author concluded that further attempts to decompose muriatic acid using simple elective attraction would be unsuccessful, and that more complex affinities might be needed to achieve this.
