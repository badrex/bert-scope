tldr: Sir Charles Bell investigates the structure of the spinal cord and its connections with the brain and nerves. He discovers six pairs of columns in the spinal cord, which are composed of concentric layers and divided by deep sulci. These columns diverge and connect to the cerebellum and the brain, forming a complex network of nerves.
