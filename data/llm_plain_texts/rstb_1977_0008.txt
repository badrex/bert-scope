tldr: This study examines the ultrastructure of the mature spermatozoid of Equisetum, a large and complex plant gamete. The research focuses on the multilayered structure's influence on the gamete's form, including the microtubules, lamellar strip, nucleus, flagella, and other organelles. The findings provide insights into the unique characteristics of Equisetum's male gamete and its role in plant reproduction.
