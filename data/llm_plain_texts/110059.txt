tldr: The author investigates the figure required to maintain the equilibrium of a homogeneous fluid mass rotating around an axis. He distinguishes two cases: one where particles do not attract each other and another where they have attractive powers. The author presents two methods for investigating the fundamental laws of this equilibrium, including a new and simple method based on the properties of inverse attraction.
