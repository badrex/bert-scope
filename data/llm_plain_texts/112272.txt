tldr: The author conducted experiments to convert albumen into fibrin by adding oxygen gas and found that the process could be facilitated by using platinum wire. The artificially produced fibrin had a more delicate consistency and regular arrangement compared to natural fibrin. The author also explored the effects of adding ammonia and gastric juice on the process.
