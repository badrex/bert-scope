tldr: The author examines the spectrum of luminous vapour from a mercury arc and compares it to the arc's spectrum. They observe changes in the spectrum as the vapour moves away from the arc, with some lines becoming more intense while others diminish. The continuous background and diffuse bands in the spectrum are also analyzed, providing insights into the properties of the luminous vapour.
