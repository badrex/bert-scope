tldr: The authors used the [14C]deoxyglucose radioautography technique to map functional activity in the brains of cephalopods, specifically octopuses and cuttlefish. They found that the optic lobe of the deprived side showed a decreased uptake of the labelled tracer in unilaterally blinded animals, suggesting that the uptake is related to functional activity. This technique could be a powerful tool in studying the functional organization of cephalopod brains.
