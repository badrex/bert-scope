tldr: This study investigates the impact of host tissue homogenates on the excretion of photosynthetic products by zooxanthellae, symbiotic algae found in marine coelenterates. The research shows that homogenates from host animals can significantly increase the excretion of photosynthetic products, such as glycerol, by the zooxanthellae. This finding suggests that there is an interaction between the animal host and the algal symbiont, which may play a role in the overall functioning of the symbiotic relationship.
