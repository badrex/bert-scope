tldr: This article investigates the hydrodynamic forces on fixed submerged cylinders, particularly in wave loads on offshore structures. The authors derive the correct form for the inertia force in a general fluid flow, challenging the conventional approach to calculating forces using Morison's Equation. They also discuss the nature of point loads occurring at cylinder ends and provide a more elaborate formula for non-circular cylinders.
