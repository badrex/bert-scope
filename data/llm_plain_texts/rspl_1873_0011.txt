tldr: 'The author, J. Clerk Maxwell, investigates the effect of double refraction in a viscous fluid in motion on polarized light. He uses Canada balsam as a test subject and observes that the fluid's state of strain can be detected by its action on polarized light. The study suggests that the method can be applied to other liquids to determine their rigidity and time of relaxation.'
