tldr: The study investigates the compound eye of the water-flea Polyphemus, which has a fused eye with 130 ommatidia and five distinct types of crystalline cones. The researchers found that the eye has regionally different optical systems, with varying interommatidial angles and adaptations such as gradient index optics and prism-like structures. These adaptations enable high-resolution vision in a small eye, allowing the water-flea to make lightning attacks on its prey.
