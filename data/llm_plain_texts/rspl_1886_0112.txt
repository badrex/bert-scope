tldr: The author developed a new type of cylindrical lens that can be used for measuring astigmatism. The lens has a constant axis with varying refraction in the perpendicular meridian. It is made by mounting two concave cylindrical lenses with varying curvatures and sliding them along their axes. This lens allows for more accurate astigmatism measurements and can be used in various optical instruments.
