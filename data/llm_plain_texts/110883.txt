tldr: The author, Carlo Matteucci, conducted experiments to further understand muscular currents and their relationship with the nervous system. He found that the intensity and duration of these currents were independent of the gas surrounding the muscle, the cerebrospinal portion of the nervous system, and certain poisons. The study also showed that the intensity of the muscular current increased with the rank of animals in the scale of beings, while its duration after death was inversely proportional to its original intensity. The author concluded that the property of muscles connected with their electric currents is identical to contractility and is developed through chemical actions during muscle nutrition.
