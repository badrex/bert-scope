revised_title: 'Generalizations and Applications of Mean Value Theorems in Analytic Functions'
semantic_tags:
  - Analytic functions
  - Mean value theorems
  - Complex analysis
  - Mathematical theorems
  - Function theory
tldr: The authors present and prove several theorems concerning mean values of analytic functions, expanding on previous research and providing new insights. They demonstrate the theorems' applications and connections to other mathematical concepts, such as the Phragmen-LindelÃ¶f theorem and Poisson's integral. The results contribute to the understanding of the behavior of analytic functions and their properties.
