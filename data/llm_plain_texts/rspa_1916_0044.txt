tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the ionization of metallic vapors, specifically mercury, in flames. They discovered that when mercury vapor emits monochromatic radiation, it is also ionized and exhibits electrical conductivity. This supports the conclusion that 4.9 volts is the ionizing potential of mercury vapor.
