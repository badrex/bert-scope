tldr: The authors studied the effects of gamma radiation on sodium deoxyribonucleate in solution. They found that gamma rays can cause a decrease in the molecular weight of DNA, leading to a drop in the solution's viscosity. The results suggest that gamma radiation disrupts the double-helical structure of DNA by breaking hydrogen bonds, which may impair DNA replication and have biological consequences.
