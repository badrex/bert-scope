tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the molecular polarizations and refractivities of basic beryllium acetate and beryllium acetylacetonate. They found that the molecules possess no permanent electric moment and that the difference between molecular polarizations and refractivities can be attributed to atomic polarization. The results suggest that the structural formula of these molecules may not be adequately represented by electrically neutral atoms.
