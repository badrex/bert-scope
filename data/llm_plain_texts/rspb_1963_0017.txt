tldr: This article discusses the production of glycollate during photosynthesis in Chlorella. The authors found that glycollate production increases when carbon dioxide concentrations are low and light intensities are high. They also discovered that the addition of isoniazid, a hydrazide, significantly increases glycollate production. This research helps to understand the process of photosynthesis and the role of glycollate in it.
