tldr: In this article, Edward Frankland explores the properties and synthesis of two new boron compounds, boric ethide and boric methide. He describes their reactions with various substances, including ammonia, and discusses their potential applications in the field of organometallic chemistry. These compounds have unique properties, such as being spontaneously flammable in contact with air and having a pungent odor.
