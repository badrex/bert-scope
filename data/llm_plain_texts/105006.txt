tldr: The author, John Ellis, attempts to identify the tree that yields the common varnish used in China and Japan. He compares the characteristics of various plants, including the pinnated Toxicodendron from North America, to determine if they match the descriptions of the true varnish tree. Ellis also investigates the properties of the Anacardium tree, known as the Cashew nut-tree, and its potential use in varnish production.
