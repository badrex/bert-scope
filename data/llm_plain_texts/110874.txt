tldr: Sir John Frederick William Herschel observed that a solution of sulfate of quinine in tartaric acid, when diluted, exhibits a vivid celestial blue color. This color appears to result from the action of the light on the liquid's strata, and it is superficial, affecting only a small depth within the medium.
