tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the quantity of carbon in carbonic acid and the nature of the diamond. They found that 100 parts of carbonic acid contain 28.6% of carbon, and that the diamond differs from charcoal only in the firmness of its aggregation. This research helped to clarify the composition of carbonic acid and the chemical properties of diamonds.
