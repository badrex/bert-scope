tldr: The authors studied the pressure developed during the explosion of cordite in closed vessels and found that the maximum pressure is proportional to the mass and volume of cordite used, and inversely proportional to the volume of the vessel. They also discovered that the time taken for the explosion is proportional to the radius of the cordite used, and the rate of increase of pressure is most rapid when about two-thirds of the maximum pressure has been attained.
