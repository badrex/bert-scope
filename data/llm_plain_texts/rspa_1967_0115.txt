tldr: This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the viscoelastic behavior of various supercooled liquids, including isopropyl benzene, sec-butyl benzene, and di(isobutyl) phthalate. The authors used high-frequency experimental techniques to measure the liquids' properties in the supercooled state, finding that the limiting shear modulus varies with temperature. The results show a striking similarity in the behavior of these liquids, leading to a new approach to interpreting viscoelastic relaxation.
