tldr: 'The authors investigated the nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of a cobyrinic acid derivative, focusing on the exchange of meso-hydrogen in porphyrins and reduced porphyrins. They observed signals from various protons in the molecule and discussed the possible assignments of these signals. The ease of electrophilic substitution at position C10 and the exchange of meso-hydrogen in different porphyrin compounds were also studied.'
