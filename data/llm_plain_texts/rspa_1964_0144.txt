tldr: The authors developed an expansion method to calculate atomic properties, specifically transition probabilities between different states. They used this method to calculate probabilities for the lithium isoelectronic sequence and found that the accuracy of their results was comparable to the Hartree-Fock approximation. The study also demonstrated the importance of considering the mixing of degenerate configurations in predicting term splittings and isotope shifts for spectral lines.
