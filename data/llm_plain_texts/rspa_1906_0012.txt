tldr: The author, Arthur Schuster, analyzes sun-spot periodicities using Fourier analysis and periodograms. He discovers a main 11-year periodicity and other possible sub-periods, such as 4.81 years and 8.38 years. Schuster also investigates the influence of planetary configurations but finds no evidence of their impact on sun-spot periodicities.
