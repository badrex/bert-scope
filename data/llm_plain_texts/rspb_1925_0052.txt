revised_title: 'Reevaluation of the Surface-Tension Theory of Muscular Contraction'

tldr: The author examines the surface-tension theory of muscular contraction, which suggests that changes in surface tension control the development of energy in muscle contractions. They analyze the relationship between tension and temperature in muscle twitches and find that the surface-tension theory does not hold up to scientific scrutiny. The author concludes that lactic acid, rather than surface tension, is responsible for the mechanical response in muscle contractions.
