tldr: The authors present a new technique for studying propagation and scattering of mixed paths with discontinuities in electromagnetic fields. They develop radar-range equations and radar cross sections for ground-wave radars, focusing on high-frequency radar for ice-hazard detection. The study assumes a vertical electric-dipole transmitter and considers various cases of electrical properties in the lower half-space.
