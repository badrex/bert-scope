tldr: The author, Hubert Airy, describes a distinct form of transient hemiopsia called Teichopsia, characterized by a blind region that grows outward in a horseshoe shape with a zigzag margin, defined by alternate bright and dark lines with gleams of color. This visual disturbance is linked to mental anxiety, bodily exhaustion, overwork, and gastric derangement. The author suggests that the cause of Teichopsia may be located in the brain, possibly in the corpora quadrigemina or geniculata, or even in the cerebellum itself.
