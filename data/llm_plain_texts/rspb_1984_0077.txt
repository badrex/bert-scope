tldr: The study investigates the uptake and assimilation of short chain carboxylic acids by the freshwater pulmonate snail Biomphalaria glabrata, which is the host of Schistosoma mansoni. The snails can achieve a net uptake of short chain carboxylic acids (C2-C4) from the medium and metabolize them. This is the first time this phenomenon has been reported for a freshwater invertebrate. The findings have implications for the behavioral and chemical ecology of the snails.
