tldr: The author, Pierce Smith, observed a unique structure in the eyes of birds that allows them to focus on objects at different distances. This structure involves imbricated scales that move when the eye muscles contract, changing the focus of the eye. This adaptation helps birds see small objects clearly while flying through dense forests and allows them to quickly focus on objects at varying distances. Smith also compared the eye structure of birds to that of quadrupeds, noting differences in their focusing abilities.
