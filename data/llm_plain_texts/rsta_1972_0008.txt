tldr: This article discusses the relationship between Cenozoic volcanic activity and plate-tectonic evolution in the Western United States. It explores how the shifting pattern of volcanism is related to regional tectonic features and how these changing volcano-tectonic systems are connected to the plate-tectonic development of the northeastern part of the Pacific Ocean and western North America.
