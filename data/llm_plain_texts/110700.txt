tldr: A letter from G. G. Anson, Esq. to the President of the Royal Society describes a curious deposit found on nine acres of land near Exeter after a flood. The specimen was sent by H.R.H. Prince Albert, F.R.S., and it is thought that this substance may have been used to make waistcoats for poor people.
