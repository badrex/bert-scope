tldr: The authors studied the cataphoretic mobility of adsorbed proteins on different surfaces. They found that the mobility is different from that observed on quartz or charcoal and discovered the isoelectric point for the adsorbed proteins. The results showed that the underlying surface significantly influences the mobility of adsorbed proteins.
