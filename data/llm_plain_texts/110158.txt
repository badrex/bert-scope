tldr: Thomas Henderson corrected an error in the calculation of the meridian difference between the Royal Observatories of Greenwich and Paris. He found an error in the reduction of Greenwich observations and made adjustments to the calculations. The corrected difference of longitude between the two observatories was 91n 21s"5. Henderson also applied the doctrine of probabilities to determine the probable error of the final result, which was 08s07.
