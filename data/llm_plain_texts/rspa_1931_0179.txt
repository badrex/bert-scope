tldr: The authors studied the arc spectrum of gold to identify electronic configurations and wave-lengths. They analyzed the terms and their values, classifying them into single-electron and many-electron spectra. The study also investigated the coupling of electronic quantum vectors and the inverted terms in the gold spectrum. This research contributes to understanding the complex electronic configurations of gold atoms and their implications in atomic spectroscopy.
