tldr: This study investigates the presence of phytoferritin, an iron-protein macromolecule, in the reproductive cells of the fern Pteridium aquilinum. Using electron microscopy and microanalysis, the researchers found that the phytoferritin in these cells is similar to that found in other vascular plants and fungi. They also discovered that the aggregates of phytoferritin in Pteridium are not crystalline, but crystallinity is revealed by optical diffractometry.
