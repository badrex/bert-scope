tldr: The author investigates the instability of liquid surfaces when accelerated in a direction perpendicular to their planes. The study examines the behavior of the interface between two fluids of different densities and the effect of acceleration on a liquid sheet of finite thickness. The research provides insights into the amplification of unstable disturbances and the conditions under which they occur.
