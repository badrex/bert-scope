tldr: The article is a biographical memoir of Karl Manne Georg Siegbahn, a renowned Swedish physicist who made significant contributions to the field of X-ray spectroscopy. Siegbahn's work led to the development of precision instruments and the extension of the available wavelength range in X-ray spectroscopy, making the Institute at Lund a leading center for research in this field. His early work focused on using X-ray spectra to identify elements, and he later discovered the M-series for uranium and other elements. Siegbahn's innovations and achievements in X-ray spectroscopy have left a lasting impact on the field of physics.
