tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the disturbances of heart rhythm caused by early-premature-beats and early-subsequent-beats. They found that these disturbances are more complex and less regular than those caused by late-premature-beats. The authors suggest that early-subsequent-beats may arise from subsidiary rhythmic centers in the sino-auricular node with longer refractory periods than the pacemaker. This research helps to understand the mechanisms behind heart rhythm disturbances and their potential treatments.
