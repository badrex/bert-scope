tldr: The author revisited sites in Hertfordshire, England, where Cepaea populations were surveyed 25 years prior. They found examples of both change and stability in shell color and banding polymorphisms. Populations in valley bottoms showed a consistent and significant decline in the frequency of yellow shells, which the author suggests is a response to climatic selection or its relaxation.
