tldr: 'The author describes the design and improvements of a second-order focusing mass spectrograph, which allows for more accurate measurements of isotopic weights. The new collimator, electric field, magnetic field, and camera design, along with better vacuum techniques and photographic plates, enable the instrument to provide clearer and more precise spectra, leading to advancements in atomic mass measurements.'
