revised_title: 'Mutation of Tryptophan-21 in NGF Affects Binding to the Fast NGF Receptor'
semantic_tags:

tldr: 'The study investigates the effects of mutating tryptophan-21 in mouse nerve growth factor (NGF) on its binding to the fast NGF receptor and neurite outgrowth on PC12 cells. The results show that the mutation affects binding to the fast NGF receptor but does not impact the biological activity of NGF in inducing neurites on PC12 cells.'
