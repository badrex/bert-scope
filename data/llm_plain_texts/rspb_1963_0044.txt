tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments to understand how human observers process information when their attention is divided. They found that when people try to focus on one task while also monitoring another, their ability to detect signals in the second task is affected. The authors propose a statistical model for signal detection, which suggests that the brain makes decisions based on the probability of a signal and the values associated with it. They also discovered that one parameter in the model remains unchanged when attention is divided, while another parameter changes, indicating that the strength of the signal is affected by divided attention.'
