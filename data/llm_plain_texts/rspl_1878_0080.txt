tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effect of different wavelengths of light on the oxidation of sensitive films. They found that the least refrangible end of the spectrum, or the red light, had the most significant effect on accelerating oxidation. This discovery helped explain the process of solarization in photography and the possibility of natural color photography. The author also discussed the role of molecular groupings in the formation of colors.
