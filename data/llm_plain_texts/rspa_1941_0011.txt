tldr: The authors developed a method to measure short radioactive life periods by varying the resolving time of the coincidence arrangement of two Geiger-Muller counters. They applied this method to measure the half-life period of radium and provided experimental evidence for the absence of gamma rays in radium decay, as well as conclusions about the lifetimes of excitation states of radium.
