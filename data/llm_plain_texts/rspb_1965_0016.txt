tldr: The authors measured the synaptic delay and the time course of acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction. They found that the synaptic delay arises mainly from the release of the neurotransmitter after the nerve impulse arrives. The minimum synaptic delay has a modal value of about 0.75 ms, and there is considerable fluctuation in the measured intervals during a series of nerve impulses. The study provides insights into the quantal process of transmitter release and its significance in synaptic transmission.
