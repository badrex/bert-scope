tldr: The author describes a new instrument called the rheotome, which is used to investigate the electrical changes in excitable tissues of plants and animals. The instrument measures the time interval between the excitation and the galvanoscopic response, allowing for a better understanding of the physiological conditions of the resting heart and the influence of temperature on its excitability.
