tldr: The authors describe a method to measure the ionization cross-section of atoms by positive ions, in which electrons are collected from single collisions of an ion beam passing through a gas at low pressures. They present measurements for twenty-three cases over energy ranges of ~5 to ~40 keV (S1) and ~100 to ~3 keV (S2). The cross-sections do not conform to the simple adiabatic theory, but the size of the cross-section in the adiabatic region appears to depend on the reduced mass of the system.
