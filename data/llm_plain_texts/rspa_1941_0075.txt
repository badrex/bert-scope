tldr: This article presents an experimental study of diffuse X-ray reflexion by single crystals. The authors discuss the various factors affecting the intensity, shape, size, position, and persistence of diffuse spots, and their relation to the crystal's nature, structure, perfection, orientation, and temperature. They also explore the use of diffuse spot patterns as a method of crystal structure determination and the physical significance of diffusely reflecting regions in reciprocal space.
