tldr: The author studied the development of various species of Cirripedia, a group of marine crustaceans, from their early stages to the adult form. They found that the general course of development was uniform across the group, but with some variations in cell division processes. The author also discussed the classification and evolution of these species, noting that the larval and adult forms have evolved independently, with similarities in development indicating a common ancestor.
