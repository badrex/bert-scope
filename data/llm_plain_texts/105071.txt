tldr: 'Thomas Heberden documented weather observations in Madeira, including temperature and rainfall data, as well as the effects of hot winds on the island. He used Fahrenheit's thermometer and barometer for his measurements. The years 1749 and 1750 were particularly dry, leading to crop and fruit tree damage.'
