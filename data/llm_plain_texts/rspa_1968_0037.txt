tldr: The authors study the effects of air drag on satellite orbits, particularly those with day-to-night variations in air density. They develop a mathematical theory for the rates of change of parameters specifying the eccentricity and argument of perigee, providing complete analytical solutions for near-circular orbits. The results are illustrated by numerical examples, highlighting the importance of understanding and accounting for air drag in satellite orbits with low eccentricity.
