tldr: The authors conducted a re-investigation of the beta-ray spectrum of radium B and radium C, using improved techniques and a uniform magnetic field. They confirmed previous findings and provided more accurate data on the energies of beta-ray groups and the absorption of X-rays in different atomic levels. The results support the idea of a nuclear level system responsible for the beta-rays and contribute to a better understanding of the disintegration process.
