tldr: The author investigates the action of a secretion obtained from the medicinal leech on blood coagulation. They discover that the leech secretion contains a substance that prevents blood from clotting by destroying the blood-coagulating ferment. This substance is soluble in distilled water and salt solution and is insoluble in chloroform, ether, benzole, and alcohol. The author also observes that the leech secretion does not affect the vitality of white blood cells and does not hinder the formation of rouleaux by red blood cells.
