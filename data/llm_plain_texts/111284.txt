tldr: The author, William Thomson, investigates the electro-dynamic properties of metals and their effects on electric conductivity. He examines the impact of stress, magnetization, and temperature on the thermo-electric qualities of various metals. The study also explores the relationship between magnetization and electric conductivity in iron and steel wires.
