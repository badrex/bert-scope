revised_title: Two-Dimensional Motion of a Plane Lamina in a Resisting Medium
semantic_tags:
  - Fluid dynamics
  - Aerodynamics
  - Air resistance
  - Resistance theory
  - Motion analysis
tldr: The authors study the two-dimensional motion of a plane lamina in a resisting medium, focusing on air resistance. They develop equations of motion and analyze the effects of air resistance on the lamina's movement, providing graphical representations of the motion and its relationship to the angle of attack and resistance constant.
