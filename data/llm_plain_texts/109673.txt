tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the most effective method of constructing a voltaic apparatus for chemical research. They found that the size and number of plates in the battery should be adjusted according to the purpose, with larger plates needed for igniting perfect conductors and more plates required for overcoming the resistance of imperfect conductors. The author also preferred a new method of constructing the trough entirely of wood, making it easier to clean and repair.
