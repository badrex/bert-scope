revised_title: Aldosterone's Role in Active Transport of Salts and Water in Living Tissues
semantic_tags:
  - Sodium transport

  - Cellular transport mechanisms
tldr: The article discusses the role of aldosterone, a hormone that stimulates active transport of sodium in living tissues. It explains how aldosterone binds to receptor sites within the transporting epithelial cells, leading to an increased sodium transport. The study also highlights the importance of metabolizable substrates in supporting this active transport process.
