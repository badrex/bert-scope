tldr: The article discusses the role of neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) in the development of the peripheral nervous system. It explains how NT-3 affects neuronal numbers in sensory and sympathetic ganglia during early development. The study found that NT-3 can regulate cell numbers before the period of target-derived control and has different effects on sensory neurons during various phases of development.
