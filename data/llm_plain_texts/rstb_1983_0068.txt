tldr: This article discusses the windborne spread of insect-transmitted diseases, focusing on the movement of disease-carrying insects like mosquitoes, midges, and sand flies. The author explains how wind plays a significant role in the direction and distance of these insects' movements, which can impact disease spread. Understanding these factors can help improve disease monitoring and control efforts.
