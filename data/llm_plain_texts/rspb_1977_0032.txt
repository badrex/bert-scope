tldr: The study demonstrates the transmission of Leishmania mexicana amazonensis from sandflies to hamsters through infected bites. The researchers found that some infected sandflies had difficulty taking a second blood meal, which may be due to the parasites blocking the pores of the cibarial sensilla. This could be an advantage in the evolution of Leishmania.
