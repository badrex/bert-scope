tldr: The author, Everard Home, studied the structure and location of solvent glands in various bird species based on their diet and lifestyle. He observed differences in the glands' structure and size in birds that consume animal food and those that eat grains. Home also noted the weak muscular structure of the gizzard in some birds, which he believed was related to their mode of motion and the grinding of food.
