revised_title: Formation of Diamond through Metallic Reactions
semantic_tags:
  - Diamond formation
  - Metallic reactions
  - Solvent power
  - High pressure and temperature
  - Gaseous solvents
tldr: The author conducted experiments to form diamonds by using alkali metals like sodium, potassium, and lithium with paraffin spirit. They discovered that lithium yielded better results, but were unable to obtain a solid diamond. The author also studied the solvent power of water and gaseous solvents, and the effects of pressure and temperature on solubility.
