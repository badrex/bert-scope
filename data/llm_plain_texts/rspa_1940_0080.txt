tldr: This study investigates the base-catalyzed prototropy of substituted acetones, focusing on reaction kinetics and the effect of different catalysts. The authors measure the catalytic constants of various carboxylate anions and find that the exponent decreases as the reactivity of the ketone increases. The results show that hydroxyl ions are less effective catalysts than predicted by the Bronsted equation, providing insights into the potential energy curves involved in the reactions.
