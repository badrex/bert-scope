semantic_tags:

  - Functors
  - Representation theory
tldr: The article explores the concept of finitely presented functors and provides a characterization of these functors using Auslander and Reiten's theorem. It also introduces a new category and discusses properties of finitely presented functors, such as monomorphisms and epimorphisms, and their relation to injective and projective functors.
