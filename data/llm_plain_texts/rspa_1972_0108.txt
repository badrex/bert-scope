tldr: The authors propose a defect-diffusion model of viscoelasticity in liquids, which is based on the idea that relaxation can only occur when a defect diffuses to a molecular site. They demonstrate that this model can be applied to a class of supercooled non-polymeric molecular liquids, and provide a series of mathematical approximations to describe the behavior of the model.
