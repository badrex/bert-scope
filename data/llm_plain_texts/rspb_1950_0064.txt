tldr: The author investigates the reducing power and growth rate of bacterial cultures, specifically Bact. lactis aerogenes, during adaptation to different carbon substrates. They find that the reducing power remains nearly constant for various carbon sources, while the growth rate varies. The study suggests that there is a rate-limiting step in the part of the cell mechanism that consumes molecular oxygen, which is not altered by adaptation to new carbon sources.
