tldr: The author, Fr. Hauksbee, conducted an experiment to study the direction of a drop of oil of oranges between two glass planes. He observed that the drop would move towards the side where the planes were touching, and the velocity of its motion would increase as it approached the touching side. This experiment confirmed previous findings on the ascent of water in different-sized tubes or between planes with varying distances. The experiment's results were consistent in both open air and vacuum, indicating that air has no role in producing this phenomenon.
