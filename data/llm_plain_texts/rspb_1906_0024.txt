tldr: The authors conducted a biometrical study on conjugation in Paramecium, a type of single-celled organism. They found that conjugants, or paired individuals, have a strikingly different type and variability compared to non-conjugants living in the same culture. The study also showed a high degree of assortative pairing, meaning that conjugants tend to have similar characteristics, particularly in length and shape.
