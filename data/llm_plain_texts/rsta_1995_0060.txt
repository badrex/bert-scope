tldr: This article presents corrections to a previous publication on relativistic ab-initio calculations of ionic solids. The author addresses errors in notation, equations, and data input, which led to slight inaccuracies in the computed values. The corrected calculations provide a more accurate representation of the properties of ionic solids.
