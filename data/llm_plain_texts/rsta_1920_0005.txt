tldr: The authors investigate the intensity relations in the spectrum of helium and discuss various factors that affect the distribution of intensity in spectral lines, such as impurities, pressure, and the presence of other gases. They also study the cathode glow and dark space in a vacuum tube, observing the Stark effect and the distribution of potential in these regions. Their work provides valuable insights into the understanding of astrophysical spectra and the behavior of elements under varying conditions.
