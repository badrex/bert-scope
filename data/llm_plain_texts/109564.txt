tldr: 'Richard Chenevix conducted experiments on the chemical composition of the eye's humours in sheep and humans. He found that the humours are composed of water, albumen, gelatine, and a muriate with a soda base. Chenevix also discovered that the density of the crystalline humour in humans is greater than in sheep, which helps maintain the eye's achromatic effect. He suggested that albumen coagulation might be the cause of cataracts and recommended further research on this topic.'
