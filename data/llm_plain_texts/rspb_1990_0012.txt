tldr: The article presents a computational model for estimating local image velocity using directionally selective frequency-tuned filters. The model demonstrates how the outputs of these filters can be combined to detect local image velocity and simulate 'Pattern' cells in the middle temporal area. The model's findings are consistent with physiological data from the primary visual cortex, suggesting that this approach may be a crucial step in understanding the early stages of visual processing and motion perception.
