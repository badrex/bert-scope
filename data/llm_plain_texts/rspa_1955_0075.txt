tldr: The authors developed a temperature-wave method to measure the specific heat of metals at low temperatures. This method uses a rod with a heater and two thermometers, allowing for the determination of thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity. The technique was tested on copper and aluminum specimens in the liquid-helium temperature range, providing accurate results with fewer systematic errors compared to the static method.
