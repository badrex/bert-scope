tldr: This study examines regional dialects in the contact call of the yellow-naped amazon parrot. Researchers found three distinct dialects covering large geographic areas in Costa Rica, with some birds at bordering roosts using calls from both neighboring dialects. This pattern suggests that dialect borders act as barriers to the spread of foreign calls, which could have implications for genetic isolation of populations and speciation.
