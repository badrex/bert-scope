tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine if vapour and smoke are conductors of electricity. They found that the vapour of hot water and smoke from a burning taper can conduct electricity, causing pith balls to separate and diverge. This discovery expanded the understanding of how electricity can travel through different mediums.
