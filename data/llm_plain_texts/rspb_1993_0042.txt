tldr: The authors analyze the historical factors contributing to the decline of the African elephant population, focusing on the effects of carrying capacity reductions and hunting for ivory. They develop a model to disentangle the effects of these two factors on elephant population dynamics since 1814, concluding that carrying capacity reductions were a major cause of population declines in the 19th and early 20th centuries, while hunting for ivory has been the cause of an increasingly rapid population decline since 1950.
