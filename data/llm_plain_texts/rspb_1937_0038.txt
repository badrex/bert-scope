tldr: 'This study investigates the effects of X-rays on the growth and death of bacteria. The authors found that X-rays have a lethal effect on bacteria, with the mean lethal dose being independent of intensity and temperature. They also discovered that X-rays cause the production of abnormally long bacterial forms, which could have implications for understanding bacterial growth and survival.'
