tldr: The authors describe the construction, operation, and performance of a primary standard mercury column for measuring high pressures. They discuss the accuracy and limitations of free-piston gauges and present a method for calibrating them using a mercury column. The study focuses on the compressibility of mercury and liquid paraffin, which are essential for accurate pressure measurements. The standard deviation of the pressure measurement is found to be about one part in 34,000 at 1000 bar and one part in 18,000 at 2000 bar.
