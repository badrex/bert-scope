tldr: The author presents a method for directly integrating Maxwell's equations for free space using a four-dimensional integral identity. The method is applied to calculate the electromagnetic fields of moving electric charges and electric and magnetic dipoles. This direct method avoids the need to differentiate potential functions, making it simpler than other methods.
