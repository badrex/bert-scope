tldr: The authors studied the band spectrum of silicon monosulphide and its relation to similar molecules. They used a specialized tube to create a discharge through the monosulphide vapor and observed the resulting spectrum. Their findings provide evidence that the lower electronic state is the ground state and demonstrate the presence of unpolymerized silicon monosulphide in the vaporized substance.
