tldr: This study provides a new description and analysis of the genus Gephyrostegus, an early tetrapod from the Carboniferous period. The authors describe two new specimens and discuss the genus' position within the Seymouriamorpha, emphasizing its primitive nature and comparing it to more specialized forms. They also consider the relationships between early tetrapods and suggest a new classification.
