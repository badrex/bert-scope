tldr: The authors developed a two-stage ion beam mass spectrometer to study ion-molecule reactions, particularly the interactions between acetylium and nitronium ions and aromatic compounds in the gas phase. The apparatus allows for detailed analysis of individual reaction processes, providing valuable insights into organic chemistry and high-temperature reactions.
