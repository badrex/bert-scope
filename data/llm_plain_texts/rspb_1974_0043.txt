tldr: This study investigates the effects of formaldehyde fixation on the activity of acid phosphatase in tissue samples. The authors found that fixation reduces enzyme activity, but the extent of this reduction depends on factors such as fixation time, buffer salt, and post-fixation washing. They also found that using a nitrogen-free buffer system can help retain more enzyme activity in fixed tissues. This research is important for improving the accuracy and reliability of histochemical experiments.
