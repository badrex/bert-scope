tldr: This article explores the phenomenon of supersaturated saline solutions and the role of nuclei in inducing crystallization. The author discusses the historical context of supersaturation, the action of nuclei, and the effect of temperature on solubility. The study focuses on the sodic sulfate and its three different molecular states, as well as the role of adhesion in the crystallization process. The author also provides suggestions for preserving supersaturated solutions and maintaining the chemical purity of surfaces.
