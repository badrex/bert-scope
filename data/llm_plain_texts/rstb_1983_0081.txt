revised_title: 'Interactions of Enteric Pathogens and the Intestinal Mucosa: Determinants of Bacterial and Viral Pathogenicity'
semantic_tags:
  - Pathogenicity
  - Enteric pathogens
  - Intestinal mucosa
  - Bacterial interactions
  - Viral interactions
tldr: This article discusses the various ways enteric pathogens interact with the intestinal mucosa to cause disease in a mammalian host. It explores the attributes of pathogens that help them overcome host defense mechanisms, such as motility, glycosidase production, and chemotactic and attachment factors. The article also highlights three different patterns of infection observed at the cell surface and the role of adhesins in bacterial attachment to the mucosa.
