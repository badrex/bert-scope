tldr: The author examines the circulation and reproduction systems of Gasteropodous Mollusca and refutes the idea of an aquiferous apparatus in Lamellibranchiata. They provide evidence of the direct communication between the circulatory system and the exterior, which affects our understanding of the nutritional processes in these creatures.
