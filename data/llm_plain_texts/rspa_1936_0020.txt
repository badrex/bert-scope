tldr: 'This study investigates the ultra-violet absorption of ice and compares the absorption spectra of light and heavy ice. The results show a continuous absorption with a long wavelength limit at about 1670 Ã…, indicating an abrupt rise in the absorption coefficient. The absorption spectra of ordinary water vapour and ordinary ice are also recorded and compared, revealing a displacement of the absorption limit towards shorter wavelengths in ice. The findings contribute to the understanding of light absorption processes in solids and the structure of ice.'
