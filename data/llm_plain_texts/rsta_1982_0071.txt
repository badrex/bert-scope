tldr: The authors studied the Brunhes-Matuyama polarity transition in three deep-sea sediment cores from the Pacific Ocean. They found that the transition can be described by a longitudinally confined portion in each of the virtual geomagnetic pole (VGP) paths, but is complicated by broad loops in all three records. The results provide constraints on the ability to obtain detailed records of geomagnetic field behavior in sediments of slow deposition rate and contribute further information relevant to current models of transitional field behavior.
