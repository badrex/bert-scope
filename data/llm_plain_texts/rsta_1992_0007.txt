tldr: This article explores the transport and heat flux of the Florida Current using cross-stream voltages and profiling data. The authors describe the processes behind the observed voltages, including motion-induced voltages, geomagnetic-induced voltages, and the influence of temperature, salinity, and electrochemical changes. They also discuss the conversion of voltage to transport and present the mean voltage-derived transports for the Florida Current. The study provides valuable information for understanding ocean circulation models and climate variability.
