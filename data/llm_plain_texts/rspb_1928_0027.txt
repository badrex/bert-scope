tldr: The author discusses the importance of the cerebral hemispheres in higher nervous activity and the role of conditioned reflexes in understanding the functioning of the brain. They explain how the hemispheres maintain a dynamic equilibrium between the organism and its environment and how the establishment of new nervous connections occurs in the hemispheres. The author also describes the conditions under which conditioned reflexes are established and the effects of neutral and inhibitory stimuli on these reflexes.
