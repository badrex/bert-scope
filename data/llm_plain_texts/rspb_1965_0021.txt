tldr: This study investigates the short-term effects of acute X-irradiation on oogonia and oocytes in foetal rats. The results show that irradiation disturbs the developmental synchronization of germ cells, causes changes in chromosomal morphology, and induces both immediate and delayed cell death. The most severe depletion in the total population of germ cells occurs following exposure at 15.5 days, with a significant reduction in the number of germ cells present 24 hours later. The study highlights the importance of understanding the radiosensitivity of female germ cells during foetal development.
