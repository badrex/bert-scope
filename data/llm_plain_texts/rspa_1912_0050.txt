tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the critical constants and orthobaric densities of xenon. They found that xenon has a smaller critical volume and a greater critical density than any other substance investigated at the time. The study also showed that xenon follows Cailletet and Mathias's law of rectilinear diameters.
