tldr: This article discusses the study of circular dichroism and optical rotatory dispersion in carboxyl and aromatic chromophores. The authors explore the use of these techniques in understanding the stereochemistry and conformation of molecules, focusing on carboxyl and aromatic compounds. They also introduce a sector rule for interpreting the results of circular dichroism in lactones and discuss the effects of additional rings on the magnitudes of Cotton effects.
