tldr: In the 18th century, Benjamin Robins and John Ellicott conducted experiments to determine the maximum height and visibility distance of rockets. They discovered that larger rockets could reach greater heights and emit light visible over longer distances. This research had implications for navigation, military signaling, and understanding the mechanics of rocket propulsion.
