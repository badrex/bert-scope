tldr: The author explains a mechanical paradox where two equal weights on a balance do not lose equilibrium when one weight is moved farther from the center and the other closer. The author demonstrates that the acting force of the weights is proportional to their true velocities, which are their perpendicular ascents or descents. This understanding helps to improve balance design and disprove the search for perpetual motion.
