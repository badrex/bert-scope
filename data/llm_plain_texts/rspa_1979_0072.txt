tldr: This article explores the metric perturbations of the Reissner-Nordström black hole, deriving equations for odd and even-parity perturbations using the Newman-Penrose formalism. The authors present a direct and conceptually simple treatment that parallels the one for the Schwarzschild black hole, providing a better understanding of the behavior of black holes and their perturbations.
