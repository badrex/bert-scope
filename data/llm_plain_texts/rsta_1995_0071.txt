tldr: The article discusses the thermohaline circulation of the Arctic Ocean and Greenland Sea, which is influenced by the harsh high-latitude climate and bathymetry. The circulation is conditioned by the separation of warm Atlantic water into a low-density surface layer and a denser deep circulation. This process affects the oceanic thermohaline circulation on a global scale. The article highlights the importance of understanding these processes for predicting the effects of climate change on the Arctic region and its impact on the global ocean.
