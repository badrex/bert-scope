tldr: The authors investigate the steady motion and stability of a helical vortex, a type of fluid flow pattern. They analyze the motion of the vortex under various disturbances and propose a mathematical model to understand its behavior. The study provides insights into the stability of helical vortices and their applications in fluid mechanics.
