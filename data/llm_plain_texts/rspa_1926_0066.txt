tldr: This study investigates the thermal decomposition of gaseous acetone in a homogeneous unimolecular reaction. The researchers used finely-ground flanges and a capillary tube with a resistance wire to heat the acetone and measure the reaction rates. They found that the reaction was first-order and provided insights into the reaction mechanism and thermodynamics.
