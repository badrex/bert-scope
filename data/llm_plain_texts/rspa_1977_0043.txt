tldr: The article presents a two-channel quantum defect model to analyze the principal absorption series of the strontium atom (Sr I) near the threshold. The model uses five parameters, including two eigenquantum defects, one transformation angle, and two dipole matrix elements, to express experimental data in terms of discrete and autoionization regions. The study provides information on mixing coefficients of levels, oscillator strengths, and photoabsorption cross-sections in the autoionization region.
