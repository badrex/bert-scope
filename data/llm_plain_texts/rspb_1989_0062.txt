tldr: The article investigates the actions of the insecticide 2 (nitromethylene) tetrahydro-1,3-thiazine on insect and vertebrate nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. The study finds that the compound inhibits the binding of [125I]a-bungarotoxin to insect and vertebrate membranes, indicating an agonist action at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. The results suggest that nitromethylenes may be selective for acetylcholine receptors and have potential as safe and ecologically acceptable insecticides.
