tldr: This article presents a detailed study of the chemisorption of carbon monoxide on tungsten surfaces. The authors use various techniques, including flash desorption, electron stimulated desorption, and reflexion-absorption infrared spectroscopy, to analyze the adsorption, desorption, and state interconversion processes. The results suggest that the adsorbed CO molecules dissociate on the tungsten surface, challenging the general acceptance of non-dissociative adsorption for this system.
