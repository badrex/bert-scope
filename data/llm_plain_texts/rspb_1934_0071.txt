tldr: The author describes a biological test for diagnosing early equine pregnancy using the presence of oestrin in the mare's urine. The test involves injecting prepared urine into oophorectomized female mice, observing the response, and determining pregnancy based on the cornifying effects of oestrin. This method provides a reliable and practical way to diagnose equine pregnancy, especially during the early stages of gestation.
