tldr: The author presents an electrochemical method to measure steady axial streaming near a rotating disc with torsional oscillations. The technique takes advantage of the disparate timescales for mass and momentum transfer, allowing for a more accurate measurement of steady axial streaming. The results of the experiments are discussed, and the potential extension of this technique to various self-similar flows is noted.
