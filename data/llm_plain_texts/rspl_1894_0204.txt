  - Electric meters
tldr: This article discusses the effects of hardening on transformer resistance and meteorological observations in India. The hardening process increases the resistance of transformers, and the article also presents meteorological observations made at seven stations in India. Additionally, it considers the influence of meteorological observations on vegetation and proposes a test for electric meters.
