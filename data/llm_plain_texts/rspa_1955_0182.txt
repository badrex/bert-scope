tldr: This article investigates the adhesion and charging of quartz surfaces, finding that very large charges can be obtained from the light contact of two crystal faces of quartz. The charging is not piezoelectric in origin and is not affected by the tendency of well-cleaned quartz surfaces to adhere. The author also explores the importance of surface cleaning and the role of adhesion in the charging process.
