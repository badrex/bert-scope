tldr: The author conducted experiments on the electric decomposition of carbonic oxide gas and the synthesis of marsh-gas and formic acid. They discovered that when hydrogen and carbonic oxide gas are submitted to the action of electricity, a contraction occurs, and marsh-gas and formic acid are formed. The author also identified a series of oxycarbons, which are similar to hydrocarbons, and discussed the potential applications of these findings in chemistry and natural phenomena.
