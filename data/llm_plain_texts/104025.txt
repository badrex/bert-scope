tldr: The author observed a white liquor resembling milk that appeared instead of serum separated from the blood after it had stood for some time. This substance had a different consistency and smell compared to milk and was found in a patient with indigestion and an inflammatory fever. The author questioned whether this substance was chyle turned putrid or not converted into blood due to a defect in sanguification.
