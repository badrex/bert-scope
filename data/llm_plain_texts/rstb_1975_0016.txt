tldr: The study investigates the rate at which tetrodotoxin affects sodium conductance in the squid giant axon. The researchers found that the rate is slower than in the isolated node of Ranvier, due to tetrodotoxin binding sites acting as a saturable sink in series with the barrier to free diffusion imposed by the Schwann cell. This discovery helps estimate the number of sodium channels in the squid giant axon, which is crucial for understanding its function and potential applications.
