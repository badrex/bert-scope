tldr: This article explores the effects of generalized field equations in relativity, focusing on the behavior of uniform cosmological models. The authors analyze an autonomous system of equations that describe these models using the perfect fluid approximation of Einstein's equations. They demonstrate that there are only three possible modes of behavior for a uniform universe, and discuss the implications of relaxing the energy condition, which may lead to singularity-free models.
