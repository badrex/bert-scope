tldr: This study investigates the impact of different foods on respiration and carbonic acid exhalation. The author found that nitrogenous foods, such as milk, sugar, and tea, increase the amount of carbonic acid exhaled, while starch, fat, and some alcohols have a lesser effect. The findings suggest that certain foods can be classified as "excito-respiratory," influencing the body's respiratory and metabolic processes.
