revised_title: 'Quantitative Theory of Light Absorption and Non-Radiative Transitions in F-Centres'

tldr: The authors present a quantitative theory for the shapes of absorption bands of F-centres based on the Franck-Condon principle. They consider the effect of F-centres on the lattice as static charge distributions and treat the lattice as a dielectric continuum. The absorption constant is expressed in terms of Bessel functions with imaginary arguments, and the theoretical absorption curves are in good agreement with experimental curves.
