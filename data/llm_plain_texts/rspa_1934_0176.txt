tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the electrolytic separation of hydrogen isotopes. They found that the separation factor is influenced by the hydrogen-water equilibrium and the energy associated with the ionic atmosphere. The authors also investigated the role of different electrolyte concentrations and metal-electrode combinations in the separation process.
