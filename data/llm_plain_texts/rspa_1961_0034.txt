tldr: The authors investigated the production of vibrationally excited hydroxyl radicals under isothermal conditions using flash photolysis. They studied the reaction of ozone with various substances, such as ammonia, hydrogen, hydrogen chloride, methane, and water. The results showed that the concentration of these excited species was highest at the shortest time during the photolysis flash and decreased rapidly afterward. The findings contribute to a better understanding of non-equilibrated energy distribution in chemical reactions.
