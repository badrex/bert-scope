tldr: This article explores the fluctuations of density in isotropic turbulence and derives an invariant that shows the largest scales of density fluctuations are determined by initial conditions and represent permanent features of the system. The author also derives an equation of motion for density fluctuations and discusses the manner of their maintenance when the turbulent velocities are small compared to the velocity of sound.
