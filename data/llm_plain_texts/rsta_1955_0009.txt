tldr: This article presents a series of calculations for the reflecting properties of various ionosphere models for radio waves of frequency 16. The authors used numerical methods to calculate the reflecting properties of the models and compared the results with observations. The study aimed to establish general principles for future theoretical and experimental work in understanding the properties of the ionosphere.
