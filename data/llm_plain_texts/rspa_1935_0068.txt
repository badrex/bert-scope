tldr: This article presents a study on the adsorption properties of vitreous silica, focusing on the measurement of surface area and the mechanisms of adsorption. The authors prepare a silica sample with a controlled and homogeneous surface, allowing them to conduct experiments on the adsorption of various gases and vapors. They find that the specific adsorption of permanent gases is small, so they focus on the adsorption of vapors below their critical temperatures. The results provide insights into the surface area and adsorption behavior of vitreous silica, contributing to the understanding of adsorption theory and surface chemistry.
