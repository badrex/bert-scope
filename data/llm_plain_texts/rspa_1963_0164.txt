tldr: The author presents a method for solving the Boltzmann equation for conduction electrons in anisotropic metals. The method involves expanding the solution in terms of scattering eigenfunctions and using iterative calculations to determine the coefficients. This approach allows for more accurate calculations of the electron distribution function and conductivity in complex metal structures.
