  - Transition State Theory
  - Unimolecular Reaction
  - Vibrational Energy Transfer
tldr: This article explores the dynamics of energy flow during chemical reactions using high-resolution spectroscopy. The authors study dissociating molecules and their intramolecular motion, focusing on the role of vibrational energy transfer and the transition state theory. They analyze the rate constants and energy distributions in unimolecular reactions, providing insights into the fundamental processes controlling these reactions.
