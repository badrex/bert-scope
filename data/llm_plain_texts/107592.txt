tldr: The author investigates the nests of the Java swallow and discovers that they secrete a unique mucus from their gastric glands. The nests are made from a substance similar to gelatin and albumen, which has properties that allow it to resist water and reform after drying. The Java swallow's anatomy and the process of nest-building are discussed in detail, highlighting the bird's adaptation to its environment.
