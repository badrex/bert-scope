tldr: The author studied the spectra of various metals and compounds when exposed to high-temperature oxyhydrogen flames. They discovered that most metals exhibit volatility, with manganese and iridium showing extraordinary volatility. The study also revealed the presence of characteristic bands and lines in the spectra of different elements and compounds, which can be used for identification and analysis.
