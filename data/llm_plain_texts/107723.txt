tldr: The author examines the fossil record of testaceous animals in British strata and observes a gradual approximation of species from older formations to those currently living. They discuss the extinction of certain orders and the emergence of new ones, as well as the relationship between fossil and recent shells. The author also notes the absence of naked mollusca and the predominance of operculated genera in secondary strata.
