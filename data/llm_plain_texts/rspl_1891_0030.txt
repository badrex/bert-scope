tldr: This article discusses the electromotive phenomena of the mammalian heart, focusing on the effects of temperature on the heart's electrical activity. The authors conducted experiments on dogs and found that the direction of the electrical variation is sensitive to changes in the temperature of the heart. They also observed that the excitatory wave in the ventricle is different from the wave of negativity and precedes it. The authors conclude that the base of the heart becomes negative before the apex, and its negativity overlasts that of the apex.
