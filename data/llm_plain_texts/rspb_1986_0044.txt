tldr: The author discusses the concept of modular organisms, which grow by repeating units of structure, and how they may be influenced by natural selection differently than unitary organisms. Modular growth allows exponential increase in size and may explain the absence of senescence in the genetic individual (genet). The author also mentions a Royal Society Discussion meeting on the growth and form of modular organisms.
