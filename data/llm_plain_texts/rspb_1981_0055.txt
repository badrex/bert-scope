tldr: The study investigates the repair of lesions in the bovine mammary gland caused by Escherichia coli infection. It observes the closure of lesions through the migration of cells from the margins and the formation of a continuous monolayer covering the lesion. The rapidity of closure is attributed to the retention of an intact basement membrane during lesion formation.
