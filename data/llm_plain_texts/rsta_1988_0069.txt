  - Satellite Composition
  - Early Solar System Conditions
tldr: The authors explore the compositions and origins of the Solar System's major planets and satellites, suggesting that the primary condensations during the formation of the Solar System were the Sun and the major planets, with the terrestrial planets and satellites being a secondary formation. They analyze the compositions of the planets and satellites, comparing them to the solar abundance, and discuss the implications of these findings for understanding the early Solar System.
