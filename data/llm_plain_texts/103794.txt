tldr: The author conducted an experiment to demonstrate the Earth's figure as an oblate spheroid. They used an iron axis, two iron hoops, and circular plates to represent the Earth's colures and equator. The experiment showed that the Earth's shape cannot be preserved unless it is an oblate spheroid. This supports the idea that the Earth's shape is influenced by gravity and centrifugal force.
