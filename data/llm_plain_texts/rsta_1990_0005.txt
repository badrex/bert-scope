tldr: The authors studied the thermotropic liquid-crystalline properties of binuclear transition metal carboxylates, focusing on copper and rhodium complexes. They discovered that these complexes exhibit a columnar mesophase, which can be useful for applications in electronics. The research also explored the magnetic and structural properties of these metal-containing molecular materials.
