tldr: The author proposes a system of cortical organization within the cerebral cortex and thalamus that can form and store patterns based on input signals. This system uses a network of neurons to form functions of the input signals and select the maximum value, which represents the recognized pattern. The author demonstrates that this system can learn and store specific types of patterns, but may struggle with more complex situations. The results suggest that the human brain's memory system could function similarly to this proposed model.
