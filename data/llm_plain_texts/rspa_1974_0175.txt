tldr: The authors investigated the dynamics of collisional dissociation of I2 in Ar and Xe using a 3-D classical trajectory technique. They employed stratified and importance sampling techniques to study dissociation and calculated dissociation cross-sections for the reaction as a function of impact parameter and internal energy. The equilibrium dissociation rate coefficients obtained in this work are consistent with existing experimental rate constants.
