tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the hydrolytic ferments of the pancreas and small intestine. They discovered that pancreatic amylase breaks down starch into maltose and dextrose, and that the pancreas can also convert maltose into dextrose. These findings help to explain the complex processes of digestion and nutrition in animals.
