tldr: The article discusses the role of abscisic acid (ABA) in root-to-shoot communication during stress conditions. ABA redistributes in the root system based on pH gradients, leading to a 2 to 3-fold accumulation in the xylem sap of stressed plants. This process helps in stomatal closure and influences leaf conductance and elongation.
