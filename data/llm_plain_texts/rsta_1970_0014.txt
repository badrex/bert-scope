tldr: The authors studied the short-range order and thermal vibration in crystals of anthrone and mixed crystals of anthrone-anthraquinone. They used a modified'systematic Laue' method to analyze the diffuse scattering and found that anthrone has short-range-order domains with an average length of 9 molecules in the [010] direction and 3 molecules in the [001] direction. The mixed crystals with up to 12% anthraquinone maintain the short-range order, while no short-range order was found for up to 45% anthrone in anthraquinone. The region between 12% to 55% anthraquinone in anthrone seems to define a miscibility gap, as no crystals of these compositions could be made.
