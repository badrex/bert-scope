tldr: This article discusses the formulation of rheological equations of state for homogeneous continuous materials, focusing on the transformation of these equations from convected coordinates to a fixed system. The authors explore the kinematics and dynamics of deforming materials, emphasizing the role of displacement functions and the transformation of tensors. The study aims to provide a better understanding of material properties and their behavior under different conditions.
