tldr: This article presents two studies: one on the reflex electrical effects in mixed nerve by Dr. A. D. Waller, and another on the observations of cerebro-spinal fluid in humans by StClair Thomson, Leonard Hill, and W. D. Halliburton. The latter study discusses a case of spontaneous cerebro-spinal fluid dripping from the nose, which was chemically examined and found to be different from nasal hydrorrhoea.
