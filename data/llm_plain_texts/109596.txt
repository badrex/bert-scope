tldr: This article discusses the chemical reactions between platina and mercury, exploring their interaction and the formation of compound metals. The author, Richard Chenevix, presents various experiments and observations, including the use of green sulfate of iron to precipitate the metals and the effect of different oxidization states on the reactions. Chenevix also examines the possibility of metals acting upon each other in their metallic state, altering their properties and creating compounds that may appear as simple metals.
