tldr: The author presents a new refractometer that measures the mean refractive index of glass plates and lenses using Newton's Rings. The instrument relies on two principles: the distance an image is displaced by refraction through a plate and the use of contact films to measure the central point of the rings. This method allows for precise measurements and improved accuracy in determining the refractive index of thin plates and lenses.
