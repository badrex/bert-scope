tldr: The study investigates the evolutionary relationship between social parasites and their hosts in Polistine wasps. By analyzing the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene, the researchers found that social parasites in Polistine wasps are monophyletic, which means they share a common ancestor. This finding contradicts the hypothesis that social parasites evolved sympatrically from their hosts, suggesting that speciation occurred allopatrically and independently of the evolution of social parasitism.
