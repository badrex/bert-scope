tldr: The author calculates the rate of isomerization of cyclopropane to propylene using a theory of unimolecular reactions. They analyze the vibrational structure of cyclopropane and find that the decline of the rate from high to low pressures is in agreement with experimental results. However, the theoretical pressure for a given rate is higher than the experimental value, suggesting that the theory may need refinement. The study provides a detailed classical picture of the molecule's behavior during vibration.
