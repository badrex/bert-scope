tldr: This article explores strategies for an agent, or'shadower', to actively camouflage its movements while tracking another, or'shadowee'. The authors demonstrate that the shadower can conceal its motion by moving along a trajectory that emulates the optic flow produced by a stationary object, as viewed by the moving shadowee. Algorithms are developed and tested for various scenarios, including moving toward a stationary or moving target, and are applicable to both structured and homogeneous backgrounds. The potential relevance of active motion camouflage is discussed in contexts such as'shadowing' behavior in hoverflies, predator-prey capture, and military maneuvers.
