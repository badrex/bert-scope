tldr: The author investigates the stability of a viscous liquid contained between two rotating cylinders. They find that the flow becomes unstable when the speed of the fluid exceeds a certain limit, leading to turbulent motion. The study focuses on understanding the behavior of disturbances in the fluid and their impact on the stability of the flow.
