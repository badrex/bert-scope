tldr: The author presents a new approach to understanding the laws of motion of electromagnetic fields using Hamilton's canonical form. By considering the electromagnetic field as a collection of elements in motion, the author demonstrates how the field's energy can be expressed as a function of the positions and momenta of these elements. This work extends the concept of energy and motion to electromagnetic fields, providing a deeper understanding of their behavior and interactions.
