tldr: This study investigates how the ability to exclude irrelevant distractors in attention depends on the true physical separation rather than the angular separation at the eye of the observer. The research compares different viewing distances, angular separations, and real separations in a visual reaction task, finding that the 'attention' system operates at a point later than the computation of true physical location, rather than at the very early stage where angular separation only is available.
