tldr: The authors propose a covariant theory of strong interaction symmetries, focusing on the relativistic form factors in baryon-meson and meson-meson cases. They classify particles based on a symmetry scheme and provide a detailed formalism for writing fully relativistic form factors. The new results include the relativistic form factor in strong interaction physics of the octet baryons and the and mesons, and the magnetic moments of the proton and neutron.
