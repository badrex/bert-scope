tldr: The authors determined the crystal structure of copper sulphate pentahydrate (CuSO4·5H2O) using X-ray diffraction. They found that the crystal has a triclinic structure with two molecules of CuSO4·5H2O in the unit cell. The structure was verified by comparing calculated and observed intensities. The study provides insights into the arrangement of atoms and water molecules in the crystal, which can help explain the properties and reactions of hydrated salts.
