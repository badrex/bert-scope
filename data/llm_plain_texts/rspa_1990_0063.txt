tldr: The authors used a molecular field theory to predict the phase behavior of binary nematogenic mixtures with spherical solute particles. They designed a model mixture and simulated its properties using the Monte Carlo technique. The simulation results confirmed the prediction of a re-entrant phase separation, where the mixture separates into coexisting nematic and isotropic phases at different temperatures. This observation provides a better understanding of the complex phase behavior of nematogenic mixtures.
