tldr: The authors developed a new method to study the adsorption of gases at very low pressures, focusing on the properties of adsorbed films of oxygen on tungsten. They designed an apparatus that allowed them to measure the accommodation coefficient of neon and the partial pressure of oxygen. The experiments showed that the adsorption of oxygen on tungsten led to changes in the accommodation coefficient, which could be used to study the adsorption process. The authors also discovered three different types of oxygen films on tungsten, with varying stability and mobility.
