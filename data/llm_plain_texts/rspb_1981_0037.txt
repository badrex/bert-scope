tldr: The authors studied the electrical spread of excitation in the network of retinal rods in the toad using intracellular recording. They discovered that the rod network behaves as a high-pass filter due to a time-varying voltage-dependent potassium conductance, which is a separate mechanism from the one responsible for the relaxation from peak to plateau of the rod's response to bright light.
