tldr: The authors, G. B. Buckton and A. W. Hofmann, studied the reaction of sulphuric acid with nitriles and amides. They discovered a new acid, methylo-tetra-sulphuric acid, formed by the reaction of acetonitrile with fuming sulphuric acid. This acid is stable and can be obtained from other compounds like acetamide. The reaction demonstrates the transformation of the acetic molecule under the influence of acids and bases.
