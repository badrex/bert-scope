tldr: The author explains the mechanism of isothermal distillation in the porous-disk osmometer, a device used to study the behavior of solutions. They discuss the principles, thermodynamics, and factors affecting the distillation process, such as hydrostatic pressure, temperature differences, and the efficiency of the apparatus. The author also compares the new theory with previous methods and suggests improvements for increased distillation rates.
