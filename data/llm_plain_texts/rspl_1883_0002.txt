tldr: The article is an obituary for William Stanley Jevons, a prominent logician and economist who made significant contributions to the fields of symbolical logic, political economy, and meteorology. Jevons was known for his experimental genius and mechanical inventions, such as the logical machine, which embodied the results of his intellectual labors in original and attractive forms. He was born in Liverpool in 1835 and received his education at University College London. Jevons held various positions, including assayer to the Australian mint and professor at Owens College, Manchester. His work in logic, economics, and meteorology left a lasting impact on the fields, and his untimely death was a great loss to science and philosophy.
