tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effects of electric currents on the surfaces of mutual contact of aqueous solutions. They discovered that an electric current passing between two aqueous liquids affects their diffusion and boundary line, making it indefinite at the surface where the current passes from the lighter into the heavier solution. This phenomenon can be reversed by reversing the direction of the current.
