tldr: The authors conducted a study on the turbulent fluctuations in a tidal current in the Mersey estuary. They used two Doodson current meters to record the turbulent velocity in the direction of the mean flow. The analysis showed a continuous spectrum of fluctuations, with no predominant periods or bands of periods. The integral scale of turbulence in the direction of the mean flow was estimated to be around 7, compared to 14 times the mean depth of water. The study provides insights into the behavior of turbulence in tidal currents and its potential implications for oceanography and fluid dynamics.
