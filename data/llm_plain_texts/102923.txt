tldr: The author, Anthony van Leuwenhoek, examines sand particles under a microscope and discovers their unique shapes and properties. He finds that no two sand particles are exactly alike and that they have various hexagonal, triangular, and other complex shapes. The author also observes that some sand particles have a shine due to their smooth, polished surfaces, while others are transparent or have red matter incorporated within them. These findings contribute to our understanding of sand's diverse characteristics and the natural world.
