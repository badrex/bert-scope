tldr: The author, George Rainey, describes a muscle in the eye called the choroid muscle, which plays a crucial role in adapting the eye to see objects at different distances. He explains how the muscle works by compressing the vitreous humor and moving the lens, allowing for clear vision. Rainey also compares the choroid muscle to the ciliary muscle in birds and discusses the differences in their structure and function.
