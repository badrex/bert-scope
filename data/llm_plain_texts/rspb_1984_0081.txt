tldr: Researchers discovered a small and slow inward calcium current in isolated single ventricular cells that contributes to the plateau of the cardiac action potential. This current, distinct from the conventional calcium current, plays a significant role in maintaining a major portion of the long ventricular action potential and controlling subsequent re-excitation of the cell.
