tldr: The article discusses the use of resonance Raman spectroscopy to study the structures and conformations of molecules in solution, specifically focusing on haem proteins. Resonance Raman spectroscopy offers high sensitivity and selectivity, making it a valuable tool for studying biological structures. The technique is particularly useful for haem proteins, as their rich assortment of porphyrin ring vibrations can be analyzed and used to monitor structural changes in the proteins.
