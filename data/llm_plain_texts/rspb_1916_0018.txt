tldr: The author conducted an experiment to study the effects of toxic and goitrigenous agents on pregnant goats. They found that when female goats were fed cultures of bacteria from goitrous individuals, their offspring developed congenital goitre. The study showed that the presence of goitre in the mother and the administration of cultures to the mother played a significant role in the development of congenital goitre in the offspring. The toxic products from these organisms can induce the development of large goitres in the foetus, as well as retard foetal development and cause premature cessation.
