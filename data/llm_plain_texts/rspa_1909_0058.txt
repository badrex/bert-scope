tldr: The authors analyzed the spectrum of e Orionis, a type-star of the Alnitamian Group, and discovered the origin of certain lines in the spectrum. They found that the lines were due to nitrogen and silicon occurring as impurities in the chromium used in their experiments. The study helped in understanding the composition of stars and the behavior of elements in different conditions.
