tldr: The authors studied the discharge of electricity from pointed conductors and the formation of a colored deposit on steel needle points. They found that the deposit was connected to the presence of moisture in the air and could be eliminated by using dry air. The authors also investigated the different types of deposits formed on various metal points and their characteristics.
