tldr: 'The author, John Lewis, describes the Holt-Waters' nature and virtues, attributing their effectiveness to their attenuating, astringent, and drying properties. These properties make them a valuable treatment for scorbutic and scrophulous cases, as well as other illnesses. The waters are also considered a noble diuretic, helping remove obstructions from the kidneys and promoting renal gland secretions.'
