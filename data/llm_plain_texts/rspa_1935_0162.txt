tldr: 'The authors, J. Chadwick and M. Goldhaber, discovered the nuclear photoelectric effect, where high-energy gamma rays can cause the disintegration of deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen. They found that the energy released in this process can be used to detect and study the properties of the neutron, a subatomic particle. This discovery significantly advanced the understanding of nuclear physics and laid the groundwork for future research in the field.'
