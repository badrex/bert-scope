tldr: The authors apply the Newton-Raphson method to find the zeros of determinants and calculate the latent roots of matrices. They show that under certain conditions, this method can be used for multiple latent roots and demonstrate its application to stability problems in aircraft flutter. The results are applicable to simple matrices with linear elementary divisors.
