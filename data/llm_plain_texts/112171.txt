tldr: The author discusses the low temperature in certain birds, such as the goose and grouse, and the absence of marrow in their bones. They also mention the presence of air in the femora and humeri of these birds. The author suggests that the bones have blood vessels that shrink and are absorbed during the bird's growth, rather than containing marrow.
