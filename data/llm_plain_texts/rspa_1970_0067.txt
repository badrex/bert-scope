tldr: The authors studied the recombination of iodine atoms in dilute argon solutions using flash photolysis. They discovered that the overall rate constant for the reaction is a linear function of the concentration of argon, but below a certain threshold, the relation becomes non-linear and falls below extrapolated values. The authors explain this fall-off in terms of a mechanism involving an I2* intermediate, which is supported by the temperature dependence of the recombination rate constant and the agreement with previously reported rate constants.
