tldr: This article discusses experiments conducted by John Phillips on the deviation of a pendulum's plane from the meridional and other vertical planes. The author explores the effects of various conditions, such as the weight and shape of the pendulum, suspension materials, and the influence of air currents and elliptical motion on the pendulum's deviation. The findings could potentially contribute to the improvement of timekeeping devices and understanding of gravity.
