tldr: The authors present a solution for trans-sonic flow problems, specifically flow round a body, using the hodograph transformation. They construct a flow that reduces to the incompressible flow when the Mach number tends to zero. The solution contains an arbitrary function, and different possible determinations of this function lead to an infinity of solutions for the compressible flow problem.
