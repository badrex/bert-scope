tldr: The study investigates the dynamics of cytoplasmic membranes in pancreatic acinar cells, focusing on the composition, synthesis, and turnover of the membranes involved in the intracellular transport of secretory proteins. The research reveals distinct differences in chemical composition and enzyme activities of the membranes, and that their turnover rate is slower than that of secretory proteins. These findings suggest that the intracellular transport is affected through the specific interaction, fusion, and recycling of the various participating membranes.
