tldr: Dr. Robinson reports on the successful completion and testing of the new reflecting telescope in Melbourne, Australia. The telescope's performance was found to be up to expectations, with good definition of stars and clear separation of close double stars. The author suggests possible ways to protect the telescope from environmental factors that could affect its performance. The author also praises the chosen astronomer to work with the telescope, who has experience in both theoretical and practical aspects of astronomy.
