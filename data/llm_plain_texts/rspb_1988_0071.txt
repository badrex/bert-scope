tldr: The article provides a detailed neuroanatomical map of the suboesophageal and prothoracic ganglia of the honey bee (Apis mellifera). It describes the organization of these ganglia, including their longitudinal tracts, commissures, and other prominent landmarks. The study compares the organization of the honey bee's ganglia with those of the cockroach, locust, and cricket, providing insights into the neuronal circuits underlying various behaviors in insects.
