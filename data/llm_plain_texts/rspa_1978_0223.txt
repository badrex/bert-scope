tldr: This article discusses the challenges and potential benefits of creating metal matrix composites with insulating particle fillers in low gravity environments, such as in space. The author suggests that these composites could provide valuable information about the uniformity of dispersion achievable in space manufacturing and could lead to the development of new materials. The article also highlights the difficulties of achieving a random distribution of particles in Earth-based laboratories and proposes methods to overcome these challenges.
