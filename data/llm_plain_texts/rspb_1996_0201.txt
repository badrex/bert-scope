tldr: The authors study re-entrant activity in a model of mammalian ventricular tissue and its control using resonant drift under feedback-driven stimulation. They characterize the meander of re-entrant excitation and find that resonant drift can potentially eliminate re-entry in cardiac tissue, offering a possible means of controlling re-entrant arrhythmias.
