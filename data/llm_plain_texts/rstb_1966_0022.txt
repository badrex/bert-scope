tldr: This article discusses the concept of ritualization in animal behavior and its role in reducing ambiguity in communication. Ritualization involves changes in signaling systems during evolution to make signals more effective in evoking appropriate behavior in partners. The author explores the selection pressures that lead to the elimination of ambiguity, such as reproductive isolation between species and differences in signals between sexes and subgroups within a species. The article also highlights the importance of understanding the evolutionary history of signals and the use of formal analyses of communication channels in studying animal signaling systems.
