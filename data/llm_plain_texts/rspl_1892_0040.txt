tldr: The author studied the post-embryonic development of Ciona intestinalis and Clavelina lepadiformis, two types of ascidians. They discovered differences in their development, with Ciona showing more primitive features. The study focused on the endostyle, gill-slits, and the origin of the pericardium, providing insights into the relationships between ascidians and other organisms like Amphioxus.
