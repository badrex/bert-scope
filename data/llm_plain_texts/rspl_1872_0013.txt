tldr: This article investigates the attraction of a galvanic coil on a small magnetic mass. The author uses mathematical expressions to calculate the force exerted by the current on a unit of magnetism placed near the coil. The findings contribute to the understanding of galvanomagnetic attraction and its applications in electromagnetism.
