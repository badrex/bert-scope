tldr: The author estimates the amount of dark matter in the solar vicinity by comparing the observed distribution of tracer stars with different assumptions of how unseen matter is distributed. The study suggests that about half of the matter near the Sun is in the form of unseen disc material, which has a scale height of less than 0.7. The findings also indicate that the unseen material required to hold up the rotation curves of galaxies and clusters of galaxies might be in the form of low-mass stars.
