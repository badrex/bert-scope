tldr: This article discusses the concept of cotidal lines, which represent the positions of the highest point of the tide wave at a given time. The author examines the theoretical and observed forms of these lines, considering the effects of landmasses on tidal patterns, and explores the causes of inaccuracies in tide observations. The study covers various regions, including the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans.
