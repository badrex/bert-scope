tldr: The authors developed a modified autoradiographic technique to study the transfer of molecules between cells in contact, specifically focusing on T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. They demonstrated the transfer of 51Cr, [3H]uridine, and [3H]choline between human diploid cell line cells (MRC 5) in contact. However, no transfer was observed between cytotoxic T cells and P815 target cells during a cytotoxic reaction. This suggests that communicating junctions do not contribute to the mechanism of T cell cytotoxicity.
