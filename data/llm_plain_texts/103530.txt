tldr: The author presents a treatise on calculations and tables related to the attractive force of loadstones. The tables help determine the weight a loadstone can sustain based on its characteristics and provide a method for calculating the value of loadstones in money. The author explains how to use the tables for different weight denominations, from grains to pounds, and demonstrates the importance of considering both the loadstone's goodness and the weight it sustains in determining its value.
