tldr: The author uses the Davey-Stewartson equation to study the energy transfer in the peak of a gravity-wave spectrum. The simplified model shows that energy from an isolated peak in the spectrum spreads outwards along two characteristic lines, making angles with the mean direction. This research helps to understand the development of wave energy in wave-fields with limited fetch, particularly the growth of wave energy at low frequencies.
