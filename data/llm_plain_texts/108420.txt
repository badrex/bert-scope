tldr: The author conducted a comprehensive study of tidal streams in the North Sea and English Channel, analyzing data from various sources to create twelve charts illustrating the direction and rate of the streams. The study found that the streams always run in contrary directions, meeting between specific locations and oscillating within a certain range. The author also discovered an intermediate stream in the Strait of Dover, which forms a unique feature in the tidal system of the Channel.
