tldr: This article discusses the biogeography, provincialism, evolution, and extinction during the late Silurian and early Devonian periods. It highlights the increasing level of provincialism and the absence of major adaptive radiations or extinction events during this time. The article also examines the climatic gradients, marine and continental regressions, and transgressive trends that occurred during this period.
