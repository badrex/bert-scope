tldr: This paper presents the results of the first organized attempt to obtain automatic records of temperature and humidity in the upper air of the British Isles using kites. The authors conducted forty kite ascents off the West Coast of Scotland in 1902, raising recording instruments to an average height of 5,900 feet. The study provides insights into temperature variations, humidity, and the effects of depressions on the atmosphere.
