tldr: The authors, G. D. Liveing and J. Dewar, studied the spectrum of the oxyhydrogen flame and found that it extends into the visible and ultra-violet regions. They observed a series of rhythmical groups in the spectrum and noticed a resemblance to certain parts of the water spectrum. They also found lines that matched Dr. Griinwald's predictions, making this an important contribution to the understanding of spectroscopy and the chemistry of flames.
