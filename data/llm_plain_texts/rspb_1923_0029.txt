tldr: 'The author investigates the origins of the Dusun people of North Borneo and their connection to Chinese settlers. They explore historical records and traditions, including the possible influence of Kublai Khan, to establish the Dusun claim of Chinese descent. The author also examines the evidence of Chinese influence on the Dusun culture, such as irrigation systems and architecture, and discusses the legend of the Dragon and Gomala, which may represent the history of the Chinese presence in North Borneo.'
