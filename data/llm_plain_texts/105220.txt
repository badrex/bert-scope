tldr: Samuel Tull's method of castrating fish is described, which prevents fish from reproducing and allows them to grow larger and be in season all year round. The method involves carefully cutting open the fish, removing the reproductive organs, and sewing the fish back up. This technique can be useful in managing fish populations in ponds and improving the quality of fish for consumption.
