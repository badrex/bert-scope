revised_title: 'Investigation of Odd-Mass Nuclei in the sd Shell Using the Nuclear Shell Model'

tldr: The authors investigate the odd-mass nuclei in the sd shell using the nuclear shell model and introduce a new intrinsic quantum number to account for spin-orbit coupling. They find that the energy levels and electromagnetic properties of these nuclei can be described by rotational spectra, providing a useful guide for understanding their behavior.
