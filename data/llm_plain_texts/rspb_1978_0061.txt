tldr: This article discusses the isolation and characterization of human HLA system gene products, including HLA-A, -B, -C, and Ia antigens. The authors found that these antigens are composed of a 43,000 molecular mass glycosylated polypeptide and a non-glycosylated polypeptide of molecular mass 12,000, called p2-microglobulin. The study also reveals that the A and B antigens have arisen from gene duplication, while the C gene(s) likely originated from the A gene(s). The Ia antigens do not contain p2-microglobulin and consist of two non-covalently linked glycosylated polypeptides of molecular masses 33,000 and 28,000.
