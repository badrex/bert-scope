tldr: The authors studied the melting parameters and crystal structure of polyphenyls, finding that the volume increase on melting is largest for linear polyphenyls and smallest for branched molecules that can interlock in the melt. They observed the formation of interlocked clusters of molecules or "cybotactic groups" in the melts, which have different structures and properties from the more ordered molecular aggregates that act as "crystal nuclei." This research provides insights into the melting mechanisms of complex molecular structures.
