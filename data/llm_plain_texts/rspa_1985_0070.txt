tldr: The author argues that the Church-Turing hypothesis can be reinterpreted as a physical principle, stating that every finitely realizable physical system can be perfectly simulated by a universal model computing machine operating by finite means. They show that quantum theory and the universal quantum computer are compatible with this principle, and that quantum complexity theory offers a more reasonable definition of the 'complexity' or 'knowledge' in a physical system than classical complexity theory. The universal quantum computer has remarkable properties not reproducible by any Turing machine, such as quantum parallelism, which allows certain probabilistic tasks to be performed faster than by any classical restriction of it.
