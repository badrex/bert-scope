tldr: Dr. John Wallis describes two large stone chimneys with unique architectural features found in an ancient kitchen at Edgecot, Northamptonshire. The chimneys' design allows them to support massive stone arches without the need for a timber discharger, making them structurally sound and innovative for their time. Wallis provides dimensions and details of the chimneys' construction, highlighting the use of locked stones in the lower arch and the continuation of the walling upwards to form two vast stone tunnels.
