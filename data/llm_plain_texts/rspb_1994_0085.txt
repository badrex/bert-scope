tldr: 'The study demonstrates that ants in Leptothorax unifasciatus colonies are not only faithful to specific positions within the nest, but they also quickly adapt to new nest sites while maintaining their relative positions. This social resilience has implications for the role of learning in maintaining an efficient division of labor, which contributes to the ecological success of social insects. The findings also show that ant colonies have a more precise spatial structure and greater cohesion than previously assumed.'
