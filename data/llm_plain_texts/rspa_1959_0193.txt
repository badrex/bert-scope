tldr: The authors conducted experiments using ultrasonic dispersion measurements to study the probability of transition between translational and vibrational energy in homomolecular collisions. They discovered that molecules with a distribution of fundamental frequencies undergo a single relaxation process, while molecules with a large gap between fundamental frequencies experience a double relaxation process. The results provide insights into the correlation between molecular structure and energy transition probability.
