revised_title: 'The Impact of Fat Solubility on Caisson Disease'
semantic_tags:
  - Caisson disease
  - Gas bubbles in blood

  - Decompression sickness
  - Oxygen and nitrogen solubility
tldr: The authors investigated the solubility of air in different fats and its relation to caisson disease. They found that fats, such as olive oil, cod liver oil, and lard, have a higher solubility for nitrogen and oxygen compared to water. This increased solubility may contribute to the development of caisson disease, a condition caused by the formation of gas bubbles in the blood and tissues due to rapid decompression from high atmospheric pressures. The results suggest that understanding fat solubility could help in preventing and treating caisson disease.
