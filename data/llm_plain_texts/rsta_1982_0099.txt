tldr: This article discusses the constraints on the density of baryons in the Universe, focusing on Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. The authors analyze the observed abundance of light elements and use this information to determine the baryon density, which is consistent with the predictions of the Big Bang Theory. They also discuss the potential for future observations to further refine these limits.
