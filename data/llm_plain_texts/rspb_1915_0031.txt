tldr: This study examines the development of the thymus, epithelial bodies, and thyroid in the marsupial Trichosurus vulpecula. The research finds that the thymus in marsupials has three pairs of glands, with the epithelial basis derived mainly from the ectodermal walls of the cervical sinus. The thyroid development in marsupials is similar to other mammals, with the ultimo-branchial body contributing to the lateral thyroid lobes. Trichosurus vulpecula is the first mammal to have a fully-developed thymus derived from the fourth gill-pouch constantly present.
