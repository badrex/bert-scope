tldr: The study investigates oscillatory disturbances in a rigidly rotating fluid, focusing on the effects of viscosity and resonance in a precessing circular cylinder. The linearized equations reveal discontinuities and singular surfaces within the fluid, which are influenced by the container's dimensions and rotation speeds. The research confirms that inviscid solutions are accurate approximations for high Reynolds numbers, and the findings have implications for understanding fluid dynamics and large-scale oceanic circulations.
