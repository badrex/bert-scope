tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the role of frictional hot spots in the detonation of explosives, particularly nitroglycerine. They discovered that high temperatures, around 480°C, are necessary for the explosion of nitroglycerine, which can be reached on rubbing surfaces under moderate conditions of load and speed. This provides evidence that frictional hot spots play a significant role in initiating explosive reactions.
