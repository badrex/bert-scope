tldr: The author studied the adsorption of n-dotriacontane and n-butanol on various graphites and graphitized carbon black. They found that the adsorption of n-dotriacontane is confined to the basal planes of graphite crystals due to a remarkable fit between the hydrogen atoms in the paraffin and the carbon atoms in the basal planes. The longer the chain, the more strongly it is adsorbed. The author also discovered that the adsorption of n-paraffins forms close-packed monolayers on the basal planes, with little further adsorption after the monolayers are complete.
