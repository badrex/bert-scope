tldr: This article investigates the decomposition of chlorine monoxide in gaseous and carbon tetrachloride solutions to understand the influence of solvents on the kinetics of bimolecular reactions. The results show that the rate of decomposition is similar in both phases, suggesting that solvents have a significant impact on reaction rates, and that ideal solvents like carbon tetrachloride can be identified for different reactions.
