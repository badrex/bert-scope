tldr: The author examines the theory of light dispersion and polarization using the undulatory hypothesis. They compare the theory to experimental data and find it to be a satisfactory approximation of the actual law of nature. The author suggests further investigation into the principles of extending or modifying the theory, considering the phenomena of interference and the propagation of vibratory motions through elastic media.
