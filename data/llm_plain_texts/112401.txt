tldr: In the late 19th century, William Huggins attempted to detect heat from stars using thermopiles and a sensitive galvanometer. He observed heat from stars Sirius, Pollux, and Regulus but could not make a quantitative estimate of their calorific power. Huggins believed that future research with larger telescopes could help determine the conditions of the stars' matter and their emitted light.
