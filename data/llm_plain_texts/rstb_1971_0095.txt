revised_title: Active Transport of Salts and Water in Living Tissues: Ion Transport Across Rumen and Omasum Epithelium
semantic_tags:
  - Ion transport
  - Rumen epithelium
  - Omasum epithelium
  - Sodium pump
  - Active transport
tldr: This article discusses the active transport of salts and water in living tissues, specifically focusing on ion transport across rumen and omasum epithelium. The authors present evidence for the existence of a sodium pump that transports sodium against its electrochemical potential gradient from the rumen to the blood. They also explore the relationship between sodium and chloride ion fluxes and the role of acetazolamide in reducing chloride fluxes.
