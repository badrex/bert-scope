tldr: The authors developed a method for the quantitative measurement of oxygen tension in living tissues using flush-ended gold and platinum electrodes and a transistor amplifier. They designed a circuit for automatic recording and addressed the challenges involved in biological systems. The oxygen cathode provided a current proportional to oxygen tension, allowing the measurement of oxygen consumption in tissues and the expression of diffusion current measurements in terms of oxygen tension. This method has implications for understanding tissue respiration and optimizing radiotherapy treatments.
