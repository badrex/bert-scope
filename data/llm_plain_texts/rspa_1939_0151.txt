tldr: This article investigates the magnetic susceptibilities of cupric salts, including cupric sulphate pentahydrate, copper potassium sulphate, and copper ammonium sulphate. The authors find that the salts' susceptibilities follow a Weiss law at higher temperatures and a simple Curie law at lower temperatures. The results provide insights into the magnetic properties of these materials and their crystal field effects.
