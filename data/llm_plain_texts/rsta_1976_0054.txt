tldr: This article discusses the design implications for materials selection, focusing on weldability and toughness specifications for structural steels in Japan. The authors explore various testing methods, stress states, and factors affecting the behavior of materials in real structures. They also address the need for a more scientific and realistic criterion for avoiding lamellar tearing in steel.
