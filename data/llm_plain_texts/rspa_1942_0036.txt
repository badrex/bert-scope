tldr: This study by Goodeve, Lythgoe, and Schneider investigates the photosensitivity of visual purple solutions and the scotopic sensitivity of the eye in the ultra-violet range. They found that the products of visual purple solutions in the far ultra-violet are the same as in the visible range. The aphakic eye's sensitivity was also examined, revealing the absence of absorbing substances. The study determined the limit of vision in the ultra-violet for normal and aphakic eyes, corresponding to the lens and cornea absorption thresholds, respectively.
