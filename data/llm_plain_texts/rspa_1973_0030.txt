tldr: The gas-phase electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum and dipole moment of NF were studied, finding the dipole moment to be 0.37 Debye. The rotational constant previously determined from the electronic spectrum is consistent with the electron reasons, and the quadrupole coupling constant is 1.8 MHz. The hyperfine coupling constants of the 7Li and 14N nuclei are 1.1 and 0.9 MHz, respectively.
