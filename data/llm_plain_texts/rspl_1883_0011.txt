tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of calcium, barium, and potassium salts on muscle contraction. They found that calcium prolongs the contraction of frog muscles, while potassium salts shorten it. Barium produces a unique effect similar to veratria, which is also abolished by potash. The authors plan to discuss these findings and related substances in future papers.
