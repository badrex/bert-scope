tldr: This article examines the factors responsible for land-sea level change in the Great Barrier Reef, focusing on the interpretation of data from the northern Great Barrier Reef Province. The authors emphasize the role of hydro-isostatic theory in explaining variations in relative sea level position. They discuss the effects of glacio-eustatic and hydro-isostatic factors on sea level change, as well as local factors such as changes in circulation, tidal levels, and meteorological changes. The authors apply hydro-isostatic theory developed by Walcott and Chappell to the northern Great Barrier Reef Province to understand the different elevations of paleo sea levels and their relation to isostatic movements.
