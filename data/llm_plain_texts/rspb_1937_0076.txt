tldr: This study compares the microscopical appearances of foot-and-mouth disease and vesicular stomatitis in infected animals, specifically guinea pigs. The two diseases show similar clinical manifestations, but the study aims to identify any detectable differences in the pathological pictures. The research uses dark-ground and ultra-violet light microscopy to examine the virus-like bodies present in both diseases. The findings reveal differences in size and shape, with foot-and-mouth disease having smaller and more rod-like structures, while vesicular stomatitis has larger, spherical forms.
