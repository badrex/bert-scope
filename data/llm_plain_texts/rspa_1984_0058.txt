  - Clamped-free conditions
tldr: This article investigates the inverse problem for vibrating beams with clamped-free conditions. The authors develop a model for the beam, analyze oscillatory matrices, and determine the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the system. They also explore the forced response of the beam and provide a method for finding the system parameters from a knowledge of frequency spectra.
