tldr: This article discusses the development and implementation of gas-fired rapid-heating furnaces for metal heating processes. These furnaces offer energy savings, improved product quality, and increased productivity by utilizing convection as the dominant mode of heat transfer instead of radiation. The technology has been commercialized and has been installed in over 300 units worldwide, resulting in significant energy savings and benefits for the metal reheating industry.
