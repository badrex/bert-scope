tldr: This study used neutron diffraction to measure the preferred orientation of apatite crystals in the scapula, revealing a clear relationship between the directions of muscular actions and the orientation of the crystals. The findings demonstrate that the c-axes of the crystals align with the directions of pull from attached muscles, providing insight into stress distribution in the scapula.
