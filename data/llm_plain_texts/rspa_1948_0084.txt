tldr: The authors present two methods for calculating the distribution of mass at a given depth that produces a specified gravitational field. They discuss the indeterminacy of the problem and propose a smoothing process to obtain a more accurate solution. The methods can be applied to various branches of potential theory, including geodesy and geophysics.
