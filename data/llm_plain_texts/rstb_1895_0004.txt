tldr: The author examines the evolution of the vertebral column in fishes, focusing on the development of the axial skeleton. They describe the process of segmentation and differentiation of the protovertebrae, including the roles of myotomes, sklerotomes, and the skeletogenous layer. The study provides insights into the complex development of the vertebral column and its significance in the evolution of vertebrates.
