tldr: This article presents asymptotic expansions for the Einstein-Maxwell field representing gravitational and electromagnetic energy radiation from a bounded source of matter and charge. The four news functions, which determine the flow of radiation, are shown to be responsible for the decrease in the mass of the source. The Newman-Penrose conserved quantities are obtained, and the electromagnetic contribution to the mass loss is considered.
