tldr: This article explores the evolution of reproductive strategies through experimental manipulation of the colonial hydroid Hydra. The authors investigate how colonies regulate growth and development in response to perturbations, such as the removal of polyps, peripheral stolons, or stolonal mat. The results show that while colonies can regulate growth rates, they do not rapidly return to their original growth trajectory, suggesting complex colony-wide regulation of growth. The findings provide insights into the role of selection in shaping life history traits and the relation between selection and canalization.
