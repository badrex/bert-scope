tldr: 'This study investigates the relationship between parasite levels, specifically Seuratia spp., and moult patterns in Laysan Albatrosses. The results show that albatrosses with more nematodes replace fewer primaries, grow fewer feathers at a time, and have a later moult start. These findings suggest that an individual bird's condition may affect the extent of its primary moult, which can have significant effects on future reproduction.'
