tldr: The authors studied the magnetic susceptibility of alkali n-butyrates and isovalerates near their melting points. They discovered a transitory enhancement of diamagnetic susceptibility in the mesophase region when the isotropic melt is cooled with a magnetic field applied. This finding suggests that cluster formation and changes in cation-anion binding may occur near the transition temperature. The response of these salts to applied magnetic fields reveals pronounced magnetic anomalies, particularly near the transition from isotropic to mesophase fluids.
