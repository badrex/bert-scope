tldr: Sir David Brewster studied the phenomena of mixed plates, which were originally discovered by Dr. Young. He observed similar appearances in various mineral bodies and used a thin film of egg white between plates of glass to obtain a more distinct view of the colors. Brewster deduced that these phenomena, along with those in mica and sulfate of lime, are cases of diffraction where light is obstructed by the edges of very thin transparent plates in a medium of different refractive power. This leads to the formation of fringes within the shadow of the plate and modifies the usual system of fringes.
