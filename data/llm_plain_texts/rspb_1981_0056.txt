tldr: This study investigates the effects of injecting neurotransmitters into the cephalopod cephalic aorta to induce colour changes in the skin. The results show that dopamine, noradrenalin, octopamine, acetylcholine, and 5-hydroxytryptamine cause specific colour patterns and changes in arm and mantle muscle tone. These findings provide insight into the role of neurotransmitters in cephalopod colour patterning and behaviour.
