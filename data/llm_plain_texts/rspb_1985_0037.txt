tldr: The study investigates the effects of potassium channel blockade on mammalian ventral and dorsal spinal roots during maturation. The results show that motor and sensory fibres have different sensitivities to potassium channel blockade, with ventral roots showing a decrease in the effects earlier in the maturation process. This indicates differences in the functional organization of potassium channels in motor and sensory axons, which may have implications for coding properties between these two classes of axons.
