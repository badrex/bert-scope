tldr: This article explores the dynamics of a rigid body in elliptic space, a type of non-Euclidean geometry. The author develops a method using symmetrical and homogeneous coordinates and applies it to the motion of a rigid body under the action of any forces. The theory of screws and angular velocities is also considered, leading to a better understanding of the motion of a rigid body in elliptic space.
