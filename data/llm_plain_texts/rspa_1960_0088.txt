tldr: This study investigates the inactivation of α-chymotrypsin enzyme by low-voltage X-rays and 16-electron beams. The sensitivity of the enzyme to radiation is found to be constant in air over a wide range of concentrations, but higher in the solid state. The authors suggest that the enhanced sensitivity in the solid state is connected to the disorganization of the secondary structure of the enzyme. They also found that secondary radicals formed in the presence of oxygen are less effective than primary radicals.
