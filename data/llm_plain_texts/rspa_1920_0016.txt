tldr: The authors extended and revised Kaufmann's theory on string vibrations, focusing on the impact mechanics and harmonic analysis. They developed a method to calculate the forces exerted during impact and the duration of contact, considering the elasticity of the hammer and the velocity of impact. The study also explored the practical implications of the theory in pianoforte design.
