tldr: 'The article describes the horizontal top, invented by Mr. Serson, which can be used to measure the altitude of the sun or stars even in hazy weather. Mr. James Short improved the invention and found that the air has no share in the cause of its horizontality and is actually an impediment to its motion.'
