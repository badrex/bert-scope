tldr: This article investigates the skin friction of flat plates using Oseen's approximation and asymptotic solutions. The authors present an analytical solution for the distribution of doublets along the plate and calculate the drag coefficient. The results are compared with the Prandtl-Blasius theory and experimental observations, showing a close agreement for large Reynolds numbers.
