tldr: The authors analyze the heat capacity of ammonium chloride, ammonium bromide, and a mixed crystal of these salts. They estimate the 'normal' or 'baseline' heat capacity and evaluate the contributions from lattice vibrations, torsional movement, and internal vibrations of the ammonium ions. The study provides insights into the entropy gain and the behavior of heat capacity in different phases of the salts.
