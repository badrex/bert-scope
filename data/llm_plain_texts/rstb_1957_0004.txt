tldr: The author studies the feeding mechanisms and food preferences of flamingoes, specifically the Greater Flamingo and the Lesser Flamingo. They discovered that the two species have different bill structures that allow them to filter-feed on different types of food, such as chironomid larvae and blue-green algae. The author also discusses the ecological factors that influence the distribution of flamingoes and the role of filtration in overcoming physiological challenges related to feeding in brackish and alkaline waters.
