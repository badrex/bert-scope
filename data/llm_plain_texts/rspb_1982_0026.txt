tldr: The authors determined the complete amino acid sequence of yeast phosphoglycerate mutase, a glycolytic enzyme that converts 3- and 2-phosphoglycerates. The sequence allowed for a detailed interpretation of the enzyme's high-resolution X-ray crystallographic structure. The study found that phosphoglycerate mutase from different species have a high degree of structural homology, indicating a shared evolutionary relationship. The enzyme's structure and function are of interest for understanding its role in glycolysis and its relationship to other enzymes.
