tldr: The authors studied the morphological changes in growing colonies of Aerobacter aerogenes, observing that the initially circular colonies become increasingly irregular as they grow. This irregularity is due to diffusion-controlled growth, where the balance between nutrient inflow and toxic metabolite outflow affects the colony's development. The authors also found that varying the composition of the gel or using drug-resistant strains can alter the colony's morphology.
