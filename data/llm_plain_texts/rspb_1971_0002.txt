tldr: This article discusses the cooperation between lymphocytes in the immune response, specifically focusing on the carrier effect and cellular cooperation in the induction of antibodies. The author presents evidence that the carrier effect reflects cooperation between cells and analyzes the mechanism and significance of cell cooperation using hapten-carrier systems as a model. The findings suggest that thymus-derived helper cells play a crucial role in activating antibody-forming cell precursors, and the importance of this mechanism is underlined by the central role of helper cells in immunological paralysis.
