tldr: This article discusses the osmotic pressures of concentrated aqueous solutions and describes the methods used to measure these pressures. The authors explain the difference between osmotic "force" and equilibrium pressures and provide a detailed description of their experimental setup and procedures. They also address the challenges they faced and the modifications they made to improve their measurements.
