tldr: The authors propose using lattice theory as a formalism for mental models of complex systems, explaining how mental models can be represented as a series of lattices that map onto one another. They discuss the importance of abstraction hierarchies in understanding and controlling complex systems, and how mental models can be homomorphs or isomorphs of the physical system lattice.
