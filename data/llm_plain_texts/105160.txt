tldr: The author describes a unique marine creature, the cluster-polype, found near the coast of Greenland. The polype has a bony stem and consists of multiple individual polyps connected at the base. The author also discusses the polyp's possible adaptations, such as the use of a membrane to help it move in the water. Additionally, the author connects the cluster-polype to the Encrinos, or Lilium lapideum, a little-known fossil.
