tldr: The authors conducted an experiment to investigate the directive action of one quartz crystal on another. They tested for periodic vibrations in the crystals and found that the difference between the gravitational constants for parallel and crossed axes was not greater than 1/16,500 and 1/2,850 for quadrantal and semi-circular cases, respectively. The results showed that the semi-circular vibration was more outstanding, but the authors could not conclusively prove the existence of the couples due to the small effect size.
