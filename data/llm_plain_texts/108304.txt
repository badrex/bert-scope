tldr: 'In this series of experiments, Michael Faraday investigates the magnetic condition of various substances and their effects on light. He discovers that when certain materials are placed in a magnetic field, they can alter the path of light passing through them. This finding opens up new possibilities for understanding magnetic phenomena and potentially developing a theory of general magnetic action.'
