tldr: The authors examine the development of traveling waves in isothermal chemical systems with general orders of autocatalysis and decay. They explore the initiation and propagation of reaction-diffusion traveling waves for more general autocatalytic schemes, allowing for autocatalyst decay via various powers. The study provides insights into the conditions for the development of reaction-diffusion fronts and the structure of such waves, depending on the type of autocatalytic reaction scheme and decay rate considered.
