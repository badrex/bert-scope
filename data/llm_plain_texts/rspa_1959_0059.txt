tldr: The authors studied the thermal oxidation of methylene chloride and its reaction with oxygen. They found that the reaction is a degenerately branched chain process, similar to the thermal decomposition reaction. The oxidation reactions of halogenated hydrocarbons are of interest due to their unique properties and individual behavior in both oxidation and thermal decomposition reactions. The authors investigated the kinetics of the reaction, the effect of vessel diameter, and the ignition limits of methylene chloride and oxygen mixtures. They also analyzed the reaction products and observed the effect of added nitrogen peroxide on the explosions.
