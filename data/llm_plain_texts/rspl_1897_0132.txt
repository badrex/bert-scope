tldr: The author's expedition to Lake Tanganyika discovered a diverse population of molluscs and other organisms with unique characteristics. These organisms, including six new genera of gasteropods, possess quasi-marine affinities and are distinct from the freshwater fauna found in other African lakes. The presence of these organisms suggests that Lake Tanganyika may have been connected to the sea in the past, and their unique features provide valuable insights into the lake's history and evolution.
