tldr: John Landen presents new theorems for calculating the areas of specific curve lines. These theorems are concise and do not require resolving the expression for the ordinate, making it easier to compute whole areas of curves. The theorems can be applied to various expressions, including those with xn, x2n, and x3n terms.
