tldr: The article discusses the role of the enzyme ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (Rubisco) in regulating photosynthesis in C3 plants. It explains how Rubisco adjusts photosynthesis according to the concentration of carbon dioxide and how it can either limit or regulate the rate of photosynthesis. The article also explores the effects of Rubisco regulation on the pool size of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) and the relationship between Rubisco activity and the rate of electron transport in photosynthesis.
