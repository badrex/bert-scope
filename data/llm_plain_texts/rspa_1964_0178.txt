tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the viscoelastic properties of polystyrene solutions and found that the Zimm theory accurately defines the behavior of solutions with molecular weights below 3,000. However, for higher molecular weight solutions and more concentrated solutions in poor solvents, the Zimm theory does not agree with the experimental results. The Rouse theory provides a better explanation for the viscoelastic behavior of these solutions.
