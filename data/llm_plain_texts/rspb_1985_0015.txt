tldr: This study investigates the organization of muscle fiber types and motor units in the skeletal muscles of the urodele Triturus cristatus. Four muscle fiber types are identified using light and electron microscopy, and their anatomical characteristics are analyzed. Three types of motor units are described in the biceps muscle, which correspond to slow, intermediate, and fast muscle fibers. The findings contribute to the understanding of muscle reinnervation and nerve-muscle connections in urodeles.
