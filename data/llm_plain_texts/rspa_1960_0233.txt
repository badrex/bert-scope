tldr: The authors studied the radiation-induced ionic polymerization of isobutene and its behavior in different solvents, additives, and with the presence of glass powder. They found that the yield and molecular weight of the polymer decreased with the absorbed dose, and the polymer degradation rate increased in liquid solvents compared to the solid state. The presence of glass powder significantly increased the polymer yield. The results provide insights into the mechanisms of ionic polymerization and the role of surface stabilization and chain termination reactions.
