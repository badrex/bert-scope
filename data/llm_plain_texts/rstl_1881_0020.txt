  - Infra-red Absorption
  - Molecular Grouping
  - Organic Chemistry
  - Photographic Method
tldr: 'The authors conducted research on the absorption of light by organic molecules in the infra-red region of the spectrum using the photographic method. They found that different molecular groupings in organic bodies affect their absorption in the infra-red region, and that these groupings can be identified by analyzing the absorption spectra. This research helps in understanding the behavior of organic compounds and their interactions with light.'
