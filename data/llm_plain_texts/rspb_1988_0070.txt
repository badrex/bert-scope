tldr: This study examines the sperm morphology and spermatogenesis of 11 species of Polyplacophora (Mollusca) from the suborders Lepidopleurina, Chitonina, and Acanthochitonina. The research reveals that each species has a unique sperm morphology, indicating that spermatozoa can be used as a taxonomic character. The findings suggest that the loss of the acrosome in some chitons is correlated with a modification in egg-coat thickness. The study aims to determine whether sperm morphology can provide insights into possible relationships between chiton taxa.
