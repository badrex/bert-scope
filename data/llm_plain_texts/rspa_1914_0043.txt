tldr: The authors conducted experiments using a constant-pressure gas thermometer to determine the boiling point of sulphur on the thermodynamic scale. They used a silica apparatus and measured the coefficients of expansion to calculate the boiling point accurately. The results provide a more precise understanding of the boiling point of sulphur and its implications in thermodynamics.
