tldr: The ARTEMIS system is a satellite-based environmental monitoring system developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) to forecast migrant pest populations, such as the Desert Locust. The system uses Meteosat and NOAA AVHRR data to assess rainfall and vegetation conditions, which are key factors for supporting locust population development. This information helps the FAO Emergency Centre for Locust Operations prepare situation summaries and forecasts for locust control efforts.
