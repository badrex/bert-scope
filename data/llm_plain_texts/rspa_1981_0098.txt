tldr: The author investigates the initial stages of overturning in gravity waves, proposing a potential function to describe the process. They analyze the flow using a two-dimensional, incompressible, inviscid, and irrotational model, considering the implications of the flow's multivalued nature and branch points. The study provides insights into wave behavior and the development of sharp corners or cusps in the free surface.
