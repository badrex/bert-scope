tldr: The Ariel 5 sky survey successfully observed and identified 105 extragalactic X-ray sources, with 75% of them being linked to active galaxies, including Seyfert type 1 galaxies, emission line galaxies, radio galaxies, and quasars. The survey also established clusters of galaxies as a significant class of extragalactic X-ray sources. The 2A catalogue and subsequent studies provided valuable insights into the nature of these sources and their X-ray properties.
