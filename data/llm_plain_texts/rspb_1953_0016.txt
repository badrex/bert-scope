tldr: 'The authors conducted further investigations on the structure of synthetic polypeptides, focusing on poly-y-methyl-L-glutamate. They prepared films with a high degree of orientation and used X-ray photographs and infrared observations to study the structure. The results showed an orthorhombic cell with a = 11.95A, b = 20.70A, and c = 43.2A (fiber axis). The findings contribute to understanding protein structure and the chain configuration of these polymers.'
