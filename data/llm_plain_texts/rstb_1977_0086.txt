tldr: This study investigates the morphology and sources of propagating wave-like disturbances in the Antarctic ionosphere using radio wave Doppler techniques. The research focuses on understanding the causes and role of these disturbances in the energy balance of the atmosphere. The Antarctic Peninsula is an ideal location for this study due to its unique geomagnetic and atmospheric conditions. Preliminary results indicate the presence of waves with periods ranging from less than 1 minute to over 90 minutes, with short-period waves being unusually common in the data.
