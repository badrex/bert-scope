tldr: The authors conducted a spectrographic study of the explosive combustion of methane, analyzing the effects of varying initial pressures and mixture compositions. They discovered that the presence of hydroxyl radicals in the flame reactions decreased as the initial pressure increased. The study also found that the combustion of methane-oxygen mixtures produced methyl alcohol and formaldehyde as initial explosion products. This research provided insights into the primary combustion processes and the role of hydroxyl radicals in flame reactions.
