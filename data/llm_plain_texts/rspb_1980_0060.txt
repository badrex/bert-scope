tldr: The authors conducted a detailed study of amacrine cells in the rat retina using the Golgi staining method. They identified nine morphologically distinct types of amacrine cells, including wide-field diffuse, unistratified, bistratified, and stratified diffuse cells. They also found six types of displaced amacrine cells in the ganglion cell layer. The study provides insights into the diverse types of amacrine cells and their distribution in the rat retina, which may have implications for understanding retinal function and visual processing.
