tldr: The author investigates the presence of inorganic iron compounds in chloroplasts of green plant cells, relating it to natural photosynthesis and the origin of life. They demonstrate that colloidal iron solutions, in the presence of dissolved carbon dioxide and sunlight, can synthesize formaldehyde, a crucial step in the process of organic synthesis. This suggests that life may have originated through the development of more complex organic substances from this simple beginning.
