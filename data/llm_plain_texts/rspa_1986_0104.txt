tldr: The article investigates the growth of voids in materials undergoing shear deformation, specifically focusing on nonlinearly viscous materials. The authors analyze the evolution of void size, shape, and orientation in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional cases. They also study the behavior of a cylindrical void in an incompressible, nonlinearly viscous solid and provide approximate formulas for the dilatation rate of a circular void and the void potential. The findings contribute to the development of constitutive relations for porous metals and provide insight into ductile failure mechanisms in solids.
