tldr: The authors present a three-dimensional crystal growth-disorder model with cubic symmetry. They show that imposing symmetry on the model results in similar one-dimensional properties as in previously described two-dimensional models. The study focuses on the restrictions necessary for the model to have symmetry and explores the statistical expectation values of the lattice distributions.
