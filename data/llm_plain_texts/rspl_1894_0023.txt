tldr: The author investigates the properties and behavior of ternary alloys containing aluminum, cadmium, and tin; aluminum, antimony, and lead; or aluminum, antimony, and bismuth. They study the solubility of these elements in each other and the effect of substituting one element for another. The author also examines the critical curves and the direction of slope of the lines representing the alloys' compositions.
