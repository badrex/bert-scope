tldr: The article investigates the role of nucleoside triphosphatases, particularly GTP-binding proteins, in the regulation of exocytosis in permeabilized rat mast cells. The authors found that Ca2+ and guanine nucleotides are essential effectors for exocytosis, and ATP acts as a modulator. The study provides insights into the complex mechanisms of cellular regulation and signal transduction in biological systems.
