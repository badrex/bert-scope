tldr: The author presents experiments demonstrating the absorbing power of fluid streams and the pulsation of jets. The experiments involve various setups with reservoirs, tubes, and colored fluids. The author explains the pulsatory character of jets as a result of air bubbles forming and obstructing the flow, which is then overcome by increased pressure.
