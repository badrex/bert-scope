tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate the excitation of polarized light by electron impact, particularly focusing on the mercury spectrum. They discovered that most mercury lines are polarized, with the direction of the maximum electric vector parallel to the electron stream. The results indicate that the light observed is emitted immediately after an electron impact, demonstrating the direct excitation of polarized light by electron impact.
