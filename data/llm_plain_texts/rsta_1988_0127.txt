tldr: This article examines the geological evolution of Tibet, focusing on the ophiolites found along the Zangbo, Banggong, and Jinsha River sutures. The ophiolites' unique features, such as thin crustal sequences, abundant sills and dykes, and N-morb petrological and geochemical composition, suggest they formed within the main neo-Tethyan ocean. The ophiolites may represent fragments of a fore-arc, island arc, back-arc complex developed above a Jurassic, northward-dipping subduction zone.
