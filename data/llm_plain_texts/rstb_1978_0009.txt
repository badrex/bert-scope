tldr: The author examines the parietal region of crossopterygian and dipnoan fishes, focusing on the lateral lines and dermal bones. They propose a modified version of the current views on the relation between these features and discuss variations in different fish species. The study provides insights into the development and growth patterns of dermal skull-roofs in various types of gnathostomatous fishes.
