tldr: This article investigates the rate at which electricity leaks through liquids that are poor conductors. The authors tested various liquids and found that their conductivity increases with temperature, similar to electrolytes. They also discovered a phenomenon called electric absorption in carbon bisulphide, a liquid dielectric. The study helps to understand the behavior of electricity in non-conductive materials.
