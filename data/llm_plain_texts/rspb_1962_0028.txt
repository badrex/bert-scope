tldr: 'This study investigates the movement of potassium in rabbit auricles and its relation to cellular physiology. The researchers found that the rate of potassium exchange was affected by the application of certain substances, such as carbachol and ouabain. These findings contribute to our understanding of the heart's electrical activity and the role of potassium in maintaining it.'
