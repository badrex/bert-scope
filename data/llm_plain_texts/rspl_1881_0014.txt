tldr: The author investigates the phenomena of the capillary electroscope, focusing on the movements of mercury under the influence of electric currents. They examine various conditions and solutions, observing that the movements are purely physical, except in cases of high tension electricity or chemical reactions between the solution and mercury. The research provides insights into the interactions between electric currents and liquids, as well as the underlying principles of capillary action and electromechanics.
