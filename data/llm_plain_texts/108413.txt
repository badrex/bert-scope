tldr: The author examines the anatomy and physiology of Salpa and Pyrosoma, two gelatinous animals, and discovers significant differences between the two species. They describe the structure and internal organization of these animals, including their respiratory and digestive systems, and discuss the reproductive processes and the "alternation of generations" theory. The author also compares their findings to previous research and discusses the role of the "elaeoblast" in the animals' development.
