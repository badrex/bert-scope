tldr: Frederick Pollock presents a method to prove the three leading properties of ellipses and hyperbolas using a well-known property of circles. This method assumes that the ellipse is the curve whose ordinate, at right angles to its axis, is to the corresponding ordinate of the circle in a constant ratio. The author demonstrates several propositions related to this curve.
