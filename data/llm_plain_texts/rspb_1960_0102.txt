tldr: The study investigates how the gut of young rats selectively absorbs antibodies from the mother's milk. It shows that the absorption rate is not dependent on the species of the antibodies but rather on the antigen used and the length of the immunization period. The research also demonstrates a selection between antibodies produced in the same species to different antigens.
