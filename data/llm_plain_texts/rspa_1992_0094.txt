tldr: The authors analyze the stability of the air-water interface to study the effect of water shear on wave generation by wind. They develop a simple model with linear wind and water shear profiles, reducing the eigenvalue problem to a quartic equation. The results indicate that water shear enhances the Kelvin-Helmholtz-type instability and lessens the Miles-type mechanism, leading to a selection rule that suppresses the growth of certain short wave components. This may be relevant to high-frequency radar imaging of the ocean.
