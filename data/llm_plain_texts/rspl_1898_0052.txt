tldr: The author proposes a new arrangement of elements using a figure-of-eight shape in space, with helium, argon, and krypton falling into neutral positions between other elements. This arrangement helps explain the properties and positions of these newly discovered inert gases and predicts the existence of other elements yet to be discovered.
