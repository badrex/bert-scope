tldr: This article discusses the challenges and methods of isolating pure zirconium and determining its atomic weight. The author presents a detailed process for preparing pure zirconia and examines various salts for use in atomic weight determination. The author also compares different methods of isolating zirconium and suggests that reliance should be placed on the production of raw material through independent processes rather than confirming results from less stable salts.
