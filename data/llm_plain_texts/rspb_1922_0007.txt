tldr: The authors studied the mechanism of ciliary movement in the gills of Mytilus edulis, discovering that cilia are capable of efficient work and converting chemical energy into kinetic energy. They observed two phases of the cilium's beat, the effective stroke and the recovery stroke, and found that the lateral, latero-frontal, and frontal cilia work together to create water currents and move food towards the mouth of the animal. The cilia's movement is an example of an automatically contractile tissue, similar to cardiac muscle cells.
