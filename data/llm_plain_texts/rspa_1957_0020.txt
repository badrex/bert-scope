tldr: The author presents a study on the decay process of incompressible isotropic turbulence, focusing on the first two equations of the infinite set of velocity correlation functions. They introduce an assumption relating the fourth-order velocity correlation to those of lower order and derive a pair of simultaneous differential equations for the energy-spectrum function. The study examines the dynamics and properties of these equations, applying them to various initial types of energy spectrum and comparing the solution with experimental data.
