tldr: The author examines the structure and development of vascular dentine, also known as vaso-dentine, and osteo-dentine, two types of dentine found in teeth. Vaso-dentine is characterized by a network of large canals containing capillaries, while osteo-dentine is formed by ossification and has a different canal system. The author proposes a new classification system for these types of dentine based on their development and structure.
