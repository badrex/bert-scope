tldr: This article explores the use of polyolefin fibers, specifically polypropylene, as a cost-effective alternative to asbestos fibers in cement matrices for low-cost sheeting. The author outlines the principles behind using continuous opened networks of fibrillated polypropylene film in a cement matrix, which enables closely spaced cracking and demonstrates the composite's ability to absorb transient overloads. The article also discusses the durability, choice of polyolefin, and theoretical considerations of using polypropylene in cement composites.
