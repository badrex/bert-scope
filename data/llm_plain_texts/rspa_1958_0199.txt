tldr: The authors conducted experiments with ice crystals in a controlled environment to study the influence of temperature and supersaturation on their growth habits. They discovered that crystal habit changes mainly due to temperature, while supersaturation has a minimal effect. The findings help to better understand the variety of shapes and patterns exhibited by natural snow crystals and their correlation with environmental factors.
