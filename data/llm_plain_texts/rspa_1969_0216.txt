tldr: The author investigated the phase dispersion of three-layer zinc sulfide-cryolite coatings and their application in interferometric wavelength measurements in the visible spectrum. They found that these coatings can be used for precise wavelength measurements when the phase dispersion is known. The study demonstrates the advantages of using these coatings in situations where the light source is low intensity or has limited life, such as when using enriched isotopes.
