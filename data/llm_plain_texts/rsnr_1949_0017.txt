tldr: This article discusses Nicolas Fatio de Duillier's hypothesis on the cause of gravity, which he proposed in the late 17th century. Fatio believed that gravity could be explained by the agitation of aether, or subtle matter, surrounding the Earth. He presented his ideas to the Royal Society and shared his findings with other prominent scientists of the time, including Isaac Newton and Christiaan Huygens.
