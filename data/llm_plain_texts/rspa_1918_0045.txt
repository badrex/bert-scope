tldr: This article investigates the electrical resolution and broadening of helium lines under the influence of electric fields. The author examines the structure of individual lines and compares them to the results obtained by Takamine and Yoshida for the electrical resolution. The study confirms the relationship between the electrical resolution and the broadening of spectral lines, suggesting that the electric field of neighboring charged particles on radiating atoms is responsible for the observed effects.
