tldr: Humphry Davy conducted experiments to study the magnetic phenomena produced by electricity. He found that an electric current could create a magnetic field, and the strength of this field was related to the amount of electricity passing through a given space. He also discovered that the magnetic effect could occur at a distance and through various materials, including air, water, and glass. These findings expanded our understanding of the relationship between electricity and magnetism.
