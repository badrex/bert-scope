tldr: The authors investigated the effects of catecholamines (adrenaline, noradrenaline, and isoprenaline) on the smooth muscle of the guinea-pig taenia coli. They found that these substances suppress spontaneous spike generation by causing hyperpolarization due to increased potassium membrane conductance (alpha-action) and by suppressing the pacemaker potential (beta-action). The study demonstrates the complex actions of catecholamines on smooth muscle and their potential implications in pharmacology.
