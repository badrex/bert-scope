tldr: In 1884, a fossilized human skull was discovered in Talgai, Queensland, during a flood. The skull was found embedded in red-brown clay, and its discovery sparked interest in understanding its origins. Anatomical investigations were conducted, and the skull was eventually purchased and presented to the University of Sydney for further study. The fossilized skull provided valuable insights into human evolution and Australian prehistory.
