tldr: The authors used cathode ray oscillography to study the adsorption and evaporation of oxygen on tungsten. They found that the oxygen layer on the tungsten surface reduces the electron emission and measured the durations of the absorbed state of oxygen. The study provides insights into the heat of evaporation and the stability of the adsorbed layer.
