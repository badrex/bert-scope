tldr: The author examines the process of digestion in Carchesium polypinum, a ciliate infusorian, and investigates the formation and function of food vacuoles. They observe the ingestion of various particles, including proteins, pigments, and bacteria, and describe the rearrangement of these particles within the vacuoles. The author proposes a hypothesis that a viscous substance within the vacuole may be responsible for dragging solid particles together during the aggregation process.
