tldr: In a letter to John Pringle, Dr. Robert Whytt, a professor of medicine, shares his account of the earthquake experienced in Glasgow and Dumbarton, as well as a shower of dust that fell on a ship between Shetland and Iceland. The earthquake occurred on the night of December 30th and 31st, with three successive shocks felt in various locations. The dust shower happened on October 23rd or 24th, when the weather was calm, and the ship was 25 leagues away from Shetland. The dust was likely caused by the volcanic eruption of Hecla in Iceland in October.
