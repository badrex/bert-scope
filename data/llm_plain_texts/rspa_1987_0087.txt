tldr: This article discusses the discovery of narrow V-shaped wakes behind surface ships observed from space using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. The traditional Kelvin wake geometry, consisting of divergent and transverse wave components, does not explain these radar wakes. The authors propose that the wave generation is by an intermittent rather than a steady point source, and they explain the observed features in terms of Bragg scattering from relatively short waves generated by the surface vessel. This study is a step towards interpreting many unexplained naturally occurring features at the edge of the Sun glitter.
