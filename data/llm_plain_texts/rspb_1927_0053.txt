tldr: The authors conducted experiments on six monkeys to study the effects of different stimulus rates on the motor cortex. They discovered that the upper limit of stimulus rates that can be directly transmitted to the muscle is between 180 and 200 per second. At higher rates, an irregular rhythm of about 180 per second is observed, while at lower rates, secondary waves are introduced to make up the total rate to about 180 per second. The authors also found a lower limit at which the cortex will respond, which varies between monkeys.
