tldr: The author describes physical investigations conducted in the North Atlantic and Baffin's Bay during the voyage of H.M.S. Valorous. They discuss temperature measurements taken at various depths and analyze the data to identify distinct layers of water with different temperatures and movements. The findings suggest the existence of a superheated layer, a neutral intermediate layer, and a deep cold layer, all of which contribute to the understanding of ocean currents and water movement.
