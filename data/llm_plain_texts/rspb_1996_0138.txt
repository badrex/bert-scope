tldr: The study investigates the changes in the somatosensory cortical map in macaque monkeys after partial amputation of a digit. The results show that the representation of the remaining stump occupies the whole region of area 3b normally devoted to the entire digit. Hyperinnervation of the stump may have reactivated neurons of the somatosensory system, leading to the recovery of a cortical map with a modified organization.
