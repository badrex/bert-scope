tldr: The authors conducted an experimental study on the effects of humidity on the properties of positive corona discharge in a rod-plane gap under positive impulse voltages. They found that humidity influences various corona properties, such as net corona charge, charge density, corona radius, electric field for propagation, and charge transfer at the plane cathode. The study helps in understanding the interaction between humidity and corona properties, which is essential for improving the performance of electrical systems in humid environments.
