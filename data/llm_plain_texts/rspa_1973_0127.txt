tldr: The authors analyze the representations of the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs group and determine the Poincaré spin multiplicities and irreducibility in these representations. They show that certain B.M.S. representations contain countably infinite direct sums of Poincaré spins, while others contain direct integrals of continuous Poincaré spins. This study helps in understanding the composition of B.M.S. representations out of Poincaré irreducibles and provides insights into the determination of new quantum numbers associated with non-connected little groups.
