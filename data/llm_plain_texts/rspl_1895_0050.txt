tldr: The author, J. Norman Lockyer, investigates new gases obtained from uraninite and compares their spectra with the sun and stars. They discover that some of the gas lines are identical to lines in the solar chromosphere, providing evidence that these gases may be present in the sun. The author also discusses the importance of these findings in understanding the spectra of nebulae, bright-line stars, and white stars.
