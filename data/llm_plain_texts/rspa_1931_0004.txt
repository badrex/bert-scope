tldr: This study investigates the surface potentials of unimolecular films of long-chain fatty acids, focusing on solid, liquid condensed, and double layer films. The authors demonstrate that the structure of a double film, formed by the molecules of dissolving soap underneath a supermolecular film, is similar to that of a soap bubble. They also examine the process of surface solution and bimolecular film formation using surface potential methods.
