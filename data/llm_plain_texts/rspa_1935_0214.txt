tldr: This article investigates the temperature dependence of free electron susceptibility in metals. The author derives expressions for the temperature variation at both low and high temperatures using Fermi-Dirac statistics. The results show that the susceptibility decreases with increasing temperature, and the author provides a detailed analysis of the paramagnetic and diamagnetic effects on the susceptibility.
