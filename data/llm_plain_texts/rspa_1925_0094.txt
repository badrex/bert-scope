tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the arc spectrum and absorption properties of gold. They discovered new electronic transitions and term values in the gold atom, confirming the accuracy of Bohr's model of electronic orbits. The study also revealed the significance of inverse D triplets in the spectra of copper, silver, and gold.
