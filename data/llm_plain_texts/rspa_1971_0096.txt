tldr: The article presents a survey of recent results in convergence theory for finite-difference approximations to Dirichlet's problem for second-order linear elliptic differential equations. The author discusses various approaches, including a priori inequalities and convergence estimates, to analyze finite-difference operators and their applications in solving elliptic difference equations.
