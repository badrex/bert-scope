tldr: The author presents a stochastic variational treatment of quantum mechanics using control theory methods. This approach extends earlier results and applies them to relativistic systems, Dirac's equation, and elementary quantum field theory. The wave function is seen as a modified form of the optimal cost function, and the photon is identified as a singularity in the electromagnetic field. Interference is explained through the optimization of an expected value, depending on the information available about the system.
