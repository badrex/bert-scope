tldr: The authors investigated the dimerization of radical anions of 1,1-diphenyl ethylene and determined the absolute rate constant of this reaction. They used a flow and stop-flow technique to study the process and found that the dimerization is very rapid. The results provide insights into the chemistry of radical ions and their reactions.
