tldr: The authors studied the thermal decomposition of silver azide and its sensitization by incorporating cyanamide ions into the crystal lattice. They found that the sensitized azide explodes at a lower temperature and decomposes at a faster rate than the unsensitized azide. The authors also investigated the kinetics of the decomposition and the ionic conductivity of silver azide, providing insights into the behavior of azide reactions and the role of crystal lattice defects.
