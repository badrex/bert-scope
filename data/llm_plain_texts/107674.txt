tldr: The author, John Pond, reports a derangement in the mural circle at the Royal Observatory, which affected the accuracy of astronomical observations. The cause of the error was found to be insecure connecting braces at the ends of the telescope, which allowed the ends to bend from the center. The problem was resolved by applying additional braces to secure the telescope, resulting in improved observations.
