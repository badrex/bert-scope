tldr: The author, George Newport, conducted further research on the impregnation of the ovum in amphibians, specifically frogs. He discovered that spermatozoa not only come into contact with the egg's surface during fertilization but can also penetrate the egg's outer layers. This finding led to a revision of his previous views on the nature of impregnating influence.
