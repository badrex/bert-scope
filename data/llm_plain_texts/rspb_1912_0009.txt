tldr: The authors discovered a new species of flagellate protozoan, Herpetomonas pediculi, living in the alimentary tract of the human body louse, Pediculus vestimenti. They describe the complete life cycle of the parasite and its three stages: pre-flagellate, flagellate, and post-flagellate. The study helps to clarify the relationship between flagellates and vertebrate trypanosomes and demonstrates that Herpetomonas pediculi is a harmless parasite found only in the gut of the louse.
