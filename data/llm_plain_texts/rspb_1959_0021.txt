tldr: This study examines the non-marine mollusk species found in Aby, focusing on their freshwater counterparts. The mollusks are hardy elements that could survive cold conditions, as indicated by the pollen analysis. The research was conducted in 1957/58, during which Mr. Suggate, a member of the New Zealand Geological Survey, was visiting the Subdepartment of Quaternary Research.
