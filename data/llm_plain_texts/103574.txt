tldr: The author, Henry Pemberton, analyzes an experiment conducted by Polenus and challenges the conclusions drawn from it by Leibniz. Pemberton argues that the experiment does not support Leibniz's theory that the force of a body in motion is proportional to the square of its velocity. Instead, Pemberton demonstrates that the experiment aligns with the common understanding of motion, as established by Newton's principles.
