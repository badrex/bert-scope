tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effect of electric arc light on bacteria, specifically Bacillus anthracis spores. They found that exposing the spores to the light through quartz resulted in the death of a large number of spores, suggesting that certain wavelengths of light can be used to kill bacteria. This discovery has implications for sterilization and disinfection methods.
