tldr: Dr. Robert Morison, a botanist and professor at the University of Oxford, is seeking funding for his new project, the Universal Herbal, which aims to classify plants based on their unique features. He invites noblemen, gentlemen, and others to contribute five pounds per plate to help cover the costs of designing, engraving, and printing. In return, subscribers will receive a book containing the completed sections and a specimen of the plants, with their coats of arms engraved on the plates. Morison emphasizes the importance of completing the project for the advancement of natural history and learning in universities.
