tldr: 'In this article, E. Halley presents a mathematical theorem for finding the foci of various types of lenses, including double-convex, double-concave, plano-convex, and plano-concave lenses. The theorem takes into account the lens's shape, the distance between the object and the lens, the refractive index of the material, and the thickness of the lens. This theorem helps in designing better telescopes and microscopes by determining the focal distance and the ratio of refraction for different lens types.'
