tldr: The author investigates the behavior of complex anisotropic molecules in relation to light dispersion and scattering. They develop a theory based on these molecules, which helps explain the refractive index of transparent media and the scattering of light in dust-free transparent liquids. The study also discusses the polarization of light and its connection to molecular orientations.
