tldr: The authors compare the palaeolimnology of two lakes with contrasting acid-deposition histories. They find that the Round Loch of Glenhead has experienced a greater degree of acidification due to higher levels of atmospheric contamination and increased sulphur deposition. The study highlights the impact of atmospheric acidification on lake ecosystems and the importance of understanding these changes for environmental management.
