tldr: The authors discuss the cooperation between lymphocytes in the immune response, specifically B-lymphocytes and T-lymphocytes. They explore the role of T-lymphocytes in capturing and presenting antigens to B-lymphocytes, and how this process can be influenced by hapten competition. The study provides insights into the mechanisms of cell cooperation and the immune response.
