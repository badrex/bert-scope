tldr: The authors produced small carbon particles by evaporating graphite in an inert quenching gas atmosphere and discovered that the samples contained substantial quantities of C60, a new form of crystalline carbon called fullerite. They separated the fullerene C60 from the soot and characterized its properties, providing insights into its potential role in interstellar dust and its significance in the field of carbon chemistry.
