tldr: This article discusses the historical discovery of interstellar molecules through optical methods and the importance of further optical work to identify molecules without an electric dipole moment. It also highlights recent observations of hydrogen quadrupole spectrum in the Orion nebula and the potential for discovering more molecules through interstellar shock waves and dissociative recombination processes.
