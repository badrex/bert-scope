tldr: The authors conducted diffusion experiments with pairs of gases, nitrogen-carbon monoxide and nitrous oxide-carbon dioxide, to study their self-diffusion coefficients. The gases had similar physical properties, making the experiments a close approximation to self-diffusion. The results showed that the coefficients of self-diffusion were between the values given by the classical theory for Maxwellian molecules and rigid elastic spheres. The findings were consistent with the predictions of the quantum theory of collisions.
