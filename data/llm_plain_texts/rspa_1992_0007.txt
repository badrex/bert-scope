tldr: The author studies the spectral determinant, which has zeros at the quantum energy levels of a given system, and explores its semiclassical representation as a sum over periodic orbits in chaotic systems. By imposing the condition that the sum is real, the author derives a resummation equation that relates the contributions from long orbits to those of short orbits, leading to a formula for quantizing chaos.
