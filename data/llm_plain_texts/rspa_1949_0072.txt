tldr: This article explores the role of dislocations in causing mechanical damping in metals. The authors propose a thermoelastic mechanism where the movement of dislocations alters the stresses at any point, creating temperature gradients and leading to the dissipation of mechanical energy. They calculate the rate of energy loss produced by a dislocation oscillating with a given amplitude and discuss the effect of a collection of dislocations. The authors also investigate two subsidiary effects: thermoelastic damping arising from the interaction between vibrational stresses and the stresses surrounding stationary dislocations, and damping due to the emission of elastic waves from an oscillating dislocation.
