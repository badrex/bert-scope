tldr: The author presents a new form of Fizeau interference dilatometer that compensates for the expansion of the measuring screws, allowing for accurate thermal expansion measurements on small crystals. This instrument increases the sensitivity of the interference method and can be used for the accurate determination of the thermal expansion of artificial chemical preparations.
