tldr: This article presents an experimental and thermodynamic investigation of the hydrogen-titanium system. The temperature-pressure-concentration relationships were studied, and the equilibrium diagram was established. The study also focused on the effect of hydrogen on the transformation of pure titanium and the existence of a third phase, y, at higher hydrogen concentrations.
