tldr: The authors establish a connection between umbilic geodesics on quadrics and new soliton-like solutions of nonlinear equations, such as the Dim equation. They use geodesics on quadrics to find spatial and temporal flows, which define new classes of solutions. Umbilic solitons approach a periodic wave as space tends to infinity, and they demonstrate a "spiral" behavior of umbilic geodesics that may be interpreted as homoclinic to periodic orbits.
