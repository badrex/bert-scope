tldr: The author, Balfour Stewart, conducted experiments to determine the specific gravity of mercury at different temperatures. They used a specific-gravity bottle and compared the results with Regnault's Table of the absolute dilatation of mercury and Despretz's Table of the absolute dilatation of water. The findings showed that the specific gravity of mercury was 13.594, which agreed closely with Regnault's previous determination.
