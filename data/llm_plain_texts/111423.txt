tldr: The author investigates the early stages of inflammation in frog's feet and concludes that the primary cause is the derangement of tissues, leading to abnormal adhesiveness of blood corpuscles. This research shows that inflammation is not a result of blood obstruction but rather a response of the tissues to irritation, with blood corpuscles aggregating due to increased adhesiveness.
