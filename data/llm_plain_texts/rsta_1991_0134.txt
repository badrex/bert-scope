tldr: This article investigates the axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric flows of a non-Newtonian fluid between coaxial rotating discs. The authors analyze the constitutive equation and the equations of motion, finding that non-existence of bifurcations from the rigid body motion and their appearance from the torsional flow and other flows occur under various conditions. They also determine the type of non-axisymmetric flows likely to occur in the two-disc problem and discuss the linearized stability of these flows using numerical techniques.
