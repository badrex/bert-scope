tldr: The article discusses the process of meiotic chromosome pairing in plants, focusing on the genetic and environmental factors that influence it. The author explains how the pairing of homologous chromosomes is a developmental process consisting of several sequential steps, and how genetic analysis and environmental manipulation can help to understand the mechanisms controlling this process. The article also provides insights into the complex controls of meiotic pairing in wheat, highlighting the role of specific loci and the influence of temperature and colchicine.
