tldr: The article explores a simple model for sustained oscillations in isothermal branched-chain or autocatalytic reactions in a well-stirred open system. It examines stationary states and local stabilities, finding that for certain conditions, the system can exhibit sustained oscillations in concentrations. The model provides a foundation for understanding complex chemical systems, such as the Belousov-Zhabotinskii reaction and various enzyme reactions.
