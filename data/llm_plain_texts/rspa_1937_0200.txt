tldr: The authors explore the effects of neutron degeneracy on white dwarf stars, finding that there is an upper limit for the pressure exerted by degenerate electron gas. They also determine that a white dwarf with a mass greater than a certain critical mass cannot contain hydrogen in its interior. This research contributes to our understanding of the composition and behavior of white dwarf stars.
