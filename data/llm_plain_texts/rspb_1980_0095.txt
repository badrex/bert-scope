tldr: The author presents a detailed analysis of the structure of collagen fibrils, proposing a new model that consists of tetragonally packed dimers. The model suggests that the fibril is a stack of layers with molecules parallel to the axis in the overlap region and tilted in the gap region. This theory explains the low-angle X-ray diffraction patterns observed in tendons and provides insights into the molecular structure of collagen.
