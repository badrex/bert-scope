tldr: The author investigates the spectrum of silicon and the influence of fluorine on spectral lines. They find that certain high-temperature lines are absent in the spectrum of silicon tetra-chloride but appear when using silicon tetra-fluoride. The author concludes that the presence of chlorine in silicon compounds can extinguish these lines, suggesting that the lines are produced by high-temperature reactions in the glass of the vacuum tubes.
