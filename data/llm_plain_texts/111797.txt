tldr: The author conducted experiments on metallic and other oxides to study their catalytic properties in maintaining combustion of various gases and vapors. They found that sesquioxides, particularly iron oxide, have the strongest tendency to produce and maintain the catalytic glow. The author also discussed the implications of these findings on the atomic hypothesis and the possibility of tracing some instances of "spontaneous combustion" to the catalytic action of iron sesquioxides.
