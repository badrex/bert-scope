tldr: The authors examined thin films of lithium fluoride and copper prepared by vacuum evaporation using electron diffraction. They determined the stresses in the specimens by measuring the interplanar spacings accurately. Lithium fluoride specimens consist of long cylinders, while copper specimens have crystallites in the form of disks. The stress in lithium fluoride specimens is due to surface tension, while copper specimens have stress due to superficial oxidation. This research helps in understanding the properties of materials and their behavior under stress.
