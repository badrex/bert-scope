tldr: In 1751, James Short observed a remarkable appearance in the Moon, specifically in the lunar spot called Plato. He noticed streaks of light along the flat bottom of the spot, which he believed were similar to a previous observation made by Signor Bianchini in 1725. Short and his colleagues used a powerful telescope to search for gaps or notches in the mountains surrounding the spot, which they believed could explain the appearance of the light streaks. They were unable to find a satisfactory explanation for the phenomenon, and they sought the opinion of the Royal Society.
