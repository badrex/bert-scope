tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments to study the absorption of high-energy monochromatic radiation emitted by Thorium C. They discovered a new mode of y-ray absorption that may be nuclear in origin and varies irregularly with atomic number. The experiments were performed using an ionization chamber at high pressure, which allowed for more accurate measurements and better understanding of the absorption mechanism.'
