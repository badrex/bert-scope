tldr: This article explores the connection between multipole moments and twistors in both electromagnetism and linearized gravitational fields. The author demonstrates how to code multipole information into a set of many indexed symmetric twistors satisfying certain algebraic constraints and how to extract this information from complex-valued functions on twistor space. The article also discusses the potential applications of this twistor approach in elementary particle theory and the extension of multipole definitions to non-stationary fields and curved asymptotically flat backgrounds.
