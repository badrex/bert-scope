tldr: The authors conducted a study on the colonization of the Krakatau Islands by Psocoptera (insecta) and found 80 species of Psocoptera from 15 families on the four islands. The most abundant species are typical early colonizers, while some are more specialized and limited to specific vegetation types. The study provides insights into the differences between relatively mature and pioneer psocopteran faunas and their ecological strategies in the Old World tropics.
