tldr: The author conducted a study on the meteorology of the Lake District of Cumberland and Westmoreland, focusing on the fall of rain at various heights up to 3166 feet above sea-level. They measured the heights of several mountain stations using aneroid barometers and standard barometers, and analyzed the rainfall patterns in the region. The author discovered a new station that received nearly one-third more rain than the previously known wettest spot in Great Britain, Seathwaite in Borrowdale. This research contributes to the understanding of meteorological patterns in the region and can be useful for various scientific disciplines, including meteorology, climatology, and geology.
