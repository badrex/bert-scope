tldr: The authors examine the efficiency of muscular work and the human body's ability to transform energy. They discuss various methods of calculating efficiency and propose a new method based on the first derivative of heat production with respect to work. The study also highlights the importance of factors such as circulation and air currents in affecting the efficiency of muscular work.
