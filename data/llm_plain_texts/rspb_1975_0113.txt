semantic_tags:
  - Food Technology
  - Microwave Heating
  - Fermentation
  - Supercritical Fluids
  - Heat Treatment
tldr: 'The article discusses three domains of modern food engineering: microwaves in food processing, production of proteins for human nutrition through biosynthesis, and the use of fluids in near critical and supercritical regions. It highlights the challenges and advancements in microwave heating technology, the need for new fermenter and treatment techniques for protein production, and the potential of carbon dioxide as a solvent in food processing.'
