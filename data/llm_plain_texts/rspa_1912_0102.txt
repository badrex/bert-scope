tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the absorption of beta-rays and found that they become more absorbable after passing through a certain thickness of matter. They also discovered similarities between beta-rays and X-rays, both being not deflected by electric and magnetic fields and both exciting cathode rays in the materials they are absorbed by.
