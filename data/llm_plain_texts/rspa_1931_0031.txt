tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the diffraction of electrons in mercury vapor. They observed distinct maxima and minima in the angular scattering curves, which they attributed to the wave nature of electrons. The results provided insights into the behavior of electrons when passing through gases and helped to improve the understanding of electron scattering in various applications.
