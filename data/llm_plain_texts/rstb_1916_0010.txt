tldr: The author examines the structure and development of the skull and laryngeal cartilages in Perameles, a marsupial, using specimens at different stages of growth. They describe the unique features of the Perameles skull, such as the advanced palate and primitive jaw, and discuss the process of ossification and cartilage absorption. The research provides insights into the comparative anatomy of marsupials and their development.
