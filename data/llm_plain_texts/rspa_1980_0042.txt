tldr: The article explores the energy flux for trains of inhomogeneous plane waves in linear conservative systems, such as electromagnetism, elasticity, and fluid dynamics. The author derives general results that relate the mean energy flux vector to the mean energy density for single and multiple wave trains, providing a better understanding of energy transfer in these systems.
