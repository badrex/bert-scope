tldr: In 1737, John Bevis observed the Moon and Aldebaran using a telescope. He carefully recorded the positions of the Moon's limbs and Aldebaran as they moved across the telescope's field of view. Bevis found that Aldebaran was at a distance of slightly less than 1/10th of the Moon's diameter from the Moon's body, which was useful for navigation.
