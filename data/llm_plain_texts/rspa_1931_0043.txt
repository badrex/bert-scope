tldr: The authors investigated the Stark effect in molecular hydrogen within the range of 4100-4770 Å. They observed complex structures and resolved them into independent lines, measuring the displacements of line components. The study is discussed from a theoretical perspective, and certain groups of lines are found to be adequately described by a theory that accounts for the number and polarization of components.
