tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effects of sudden pressure relief on thermometers and glass containers. They discovered that when a sealed glass tube is exposed to high pressure and then suddenly released, the glass collapses, while a brass tube records the pressure changes. This research has implications for deep-sea exploration and thermometer design.
