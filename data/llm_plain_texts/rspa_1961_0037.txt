tldr: The authors conducted experiments on cylindrical single crystals of normal and superconducting indium at a frequency of about 3000 Mc/s. They found that the surface resistance and reactance in the normal state showed marked anisotropy, while the surface impedance in the superconducting state agreed rather well with the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory. The temperature variation of the superconducting resistance was similar to that observed in tin, providing evidence for the high-frequency behavior of superconductors.
