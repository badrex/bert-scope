tldr: The author investigates the physiological responses of Mimosa pudica plants, focusing on the petiole-pulvinus preparations. They discover methods to maintain consistent sensitivity and excitability in these preparations, allowing for further study of the effects of external conditions on plant responses. The author also discusses the role of different parts of the motor apparatus in plant reactions and the impact of sectioning on the plant's excitability.
