tldr: 'The author conducted experiments on the viscous flow of pitch and other materials to study the relationship between the rate of flow and the applied stress. They found that the rate of flow is not directly proportional to the stress, and the initial rate of flow is faster than the final rate. The author also investigated the mode of flow and the particles' movement within the material. The findings have implications for understanding the behavior of fluids and materials under stress.'
