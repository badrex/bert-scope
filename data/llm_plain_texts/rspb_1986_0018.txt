tldr: The study investigates the structure, morphology, composition, and organization of biogenic minerals in limpet teeth. It reveals that the minerals, primarily goethite and silica, form complex structures within the teeth. The researchers propose that the goethite crystallization and organization are regulated by an ordered filamentous organic matrix, while silica impregnates the matrix components, maintaining the structural integrity of the organic tissue.
