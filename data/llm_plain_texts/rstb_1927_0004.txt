tldr: The authors study the morphology and classification of Rhacopteris ferns from the Lower Carboniferous period. They analyze the structure and characteristics of these fern-like fronds and discuss their possible relationship to modern ferns or Pteridosperms. The discovery of a fossil with a connected stem and fronds provides valuable information about the growth and structure of these ancient plants.
