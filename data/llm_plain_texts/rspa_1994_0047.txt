tldr: This article presents an improved asymptotic analysis of ordinary differential equations with irregular singularities of rank one. The authors develop a theory using Stieltjes-type transforms to re-expand the remainder terms, resulting in more accurate and valid expansions. This research applies to various types of differential equations and extends the understanding of asymptotic solutions in complex scenarios.
