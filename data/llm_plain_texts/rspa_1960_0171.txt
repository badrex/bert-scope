tldr: The authors explore the kinetics of isomeric reactions and develop a new method to describe the process using a distribution function for reaction co-ordinates. They show that the concentration-dependent terms can be evaluated in terms of the solution properties of the system, providing a partial answer to the dependence of transition probabilities on concentration.
