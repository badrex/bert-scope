tldr: This article discusses the development of the theory of homonuclear decoupling combined with magic angle spinning in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) for solids with strong homonuclear dipolar broadening. The authors describe pulse sequences used to achieve high-resolution NMR in randomly orientated solids and their applications to obtain parameters other than isotropic chemical shifts.
