tldr: The article discusses the Russell effect, a phenomenon discovered in 1897 where certain materials can fog a photographic plate. The author explains how hydrogen peroxide, produced by oxidation processes, affects photographic film and proposes a method to detect its presence. Applications of the Russell effect include examining freshly abraded metals, detecting chemical treatments on paper, and testing storage materials for their potential to release hydrogen peroxide.
