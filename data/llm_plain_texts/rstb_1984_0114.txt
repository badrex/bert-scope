tldr: The authors cloned and characterized the gene for the major surface antigen of Plasmodium knowlesi sporozoites, which is involved in the malaria parasite's complex life cycle. The gene contains a 36-base pair unit repeated 12 times, which may play a role in regulating gene expression and evading the immune system. This discovery could aid in the development of vaccines and treatments for malaria.
