tldr: The article discusses the role of neurotrophins, particularly nerve growth factor (NGF), in the development, maintenance, and injury of sensory neurons. It highlights the importance of neurotrophic support in diabetic neuropathy and suggests that correcting these deficits should be a primary therapeutic target. The study also demonstrates that intensive insulin treatment and exogenous NGF administration can help normalize these deficits in rodent models of diabetes.
