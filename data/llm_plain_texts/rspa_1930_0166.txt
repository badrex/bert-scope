tldr: This article investigates the slow combustion of ethane and evaluates the mechanisms of hydrocarbon oxidation. The authors discuss the concept of "chain reactions" and the formation of peroxide centers in the combustion process. They analyze previous experiments and theories, including those of H. L. Callendar and M. Stanislas Landa, and propose a new understanding of the initial oxidation product in ethane combustion.
