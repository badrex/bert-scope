tldr: This article investigates the specific heats of gases at constant volume, focusing on air, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen. The author uses a method called the steam calorimeter to measure the specific heat of these gases over varying pressures. The results show the consistency and accuracy of the method, which can be applied to other gases and help improve our understanding of thermodynamics and gas laws.
