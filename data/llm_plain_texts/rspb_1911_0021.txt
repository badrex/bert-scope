tldr: The authors developed a new method to measure the gaseous exchanges of submerged plants, allowing for a more accurate assessment of their assimilation and respiration. The method involves a continuous flow of CO2-laden water over the plant, measuring the difference in CO2 content before and after contact with the plant. This innovative approach enables researchers to investigate the interaction of various factors, such as light, temperature, and CO2 supply, on plant growth and development.
