tldr: The authors studied the photoelectron spectra and valence shell orbital structures of group V and VI hydrides. They observed vibrational structure in bands associated with all but the inner-most valence orbitals, which they used to determine changes in bond angles and distances resulting from ionization of molecular orbitals. They also analyzed ionization from the inner 1a orbitals of the hydrides and derived vertical ionization potentials for all valence orbitals of the hydrides XH, XH2, XH3, and XH4.
