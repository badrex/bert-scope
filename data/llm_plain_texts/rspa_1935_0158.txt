tldr: The author presents a statistical theory of turbulence, explaining that turbulent motion consists of eddies of various sizes. They introduce a length called the "scale of turbulence," which is related to the correlation between the velocities at different points in the turbulent field. This theory can be applied to both Lagrangian and Eulerian conceptions of fluid flow, and it helps define the average size of eddies in turbulent flow.
