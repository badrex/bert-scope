tldr: In September 1777, an earthquake was felt in Manchester and other nearby areas. The author, Thomas Henry, provides a detailed account of the event, including the effects on buildings, people, and the atmosphere. The earthquake was felt as far away as York, Lancaster, Liverpool, Chester, Birmingham, Derby, and Gainsborough. Some people experienced electrical-like sensations, and many reported nervous pains and hysteric affections after the event. The author discusses the possibility of Dr. Stukeley's theory of earthquakes being caused by the accumulation and discharge of electrical fluid.
