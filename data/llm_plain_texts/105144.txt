tldr: In 1753, Mr. J. Short observed the transit of Mercury over the Sun using a reflecting telescope. He recorded the times of the observations and compared the sun's diameter with a refracting telescope. The observations were made from different locations, and the results were shared with the Royal Society. This event helped improve the understanding of the solar system and the accuracy of astronomical measurements.
