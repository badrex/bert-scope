tldr: The authors conducted a series of experiments to understand the effects of compression on arterial pressure in the human arm. They found that the simple schema of compressing an artery in a chamber does not accurately represent the conditions in the arm. The authors developed a more complex schema to better mimic the conditions in the arm, which included a tissue schema and a compression chamber. They discovered that the behavior of the artery is significantly influenced by the compression of a vessel placed distally to it, and thus, studying the compression of a length of artery in a simple schema does not fully explain the compression of the brachial artery in the arm.
