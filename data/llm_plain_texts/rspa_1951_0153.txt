tldr: This article examines the thermal decomposition and explosion of various azides, including inorganic and organic compounds. The authors find that self-heating of the liquid azides is due to the retention of hot products of reaction near the surface, and that nitrogen is the main gaseous product during decomposition. The influence of gas pressure and the presence of inert gases on the rate of decomposition and explosion are also studied.
