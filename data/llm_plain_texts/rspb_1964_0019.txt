tldr: 'Gluconeogenesis is the process of synthesizing glucose from non-carbohydrate sources, such as amino acids and lactate. This process is essential for maintaining glucose levels in the body, especially for cells like the nervous system and blood cells that rely on glucose for energy. The liver and kidney cortex are the main sites of gluconeogenesis, and the rate of this process is regulated according to the body's needs. The author discusses the importance of studying gluconeogenesis and presents two in vitro systems, pigeon liver homogenate and kidney cortex slices, for further research on this topic.'
