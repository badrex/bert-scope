tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the amount of light reflected by metallic surfaces, specifically silver, steel, tin, and speculum metal. They used a photometer to compare the intensity of light reflected by the metals at different angles of incidence. The results showed that the amount of reflected light varied depending on the type of metal and the angle of incidence. This research contributed to the understanding of how light interacts with metallic surfaces.
