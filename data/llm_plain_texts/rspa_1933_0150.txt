tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the transmutation of lithium by protons and ions of the heavy isotope of hydrogen. They discovered two different ranges of particles emitted from lithium, which could be explained by nuclear reactions involving neutrons and protons. The results showed that ions of the heavy isotope of hydrogen were more efficient in producing disintegration particles than protons.
