tldr: This article discusses the current amount of westerly magnetic declination on the coasts of Great Britain and its annual changes. The observations made by surveying officers of the Royal Navy between 1866 and 1870 are analyzed, and a chart of the British Islands exhibiting the lines of magnetic declination of equal value is provided. The study shows that the change in magnetic declination is greater on the eastern side of the United Kingdom than on the western side and that the change is greater in higher parallels of latitude than in the lower parallels.
