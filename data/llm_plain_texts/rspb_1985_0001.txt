tldr: 'This study investigates the responses of mechanoreceptors and thermoreceptors in the snout of the echidna, Tachyglossus aculeatus. Researchers recorded activity in nerve filaments supplying receptors in the echidna's snout skin. They found all principal classes of mechanoreceptors and both warm and cold thermoreceptors, similar to those found in other mammals. This research provides insight into the physiology of the nervous system in monotremes, the most primitive group of mammals, and contributes to understanding the evolution of cutaneous receptors.'
