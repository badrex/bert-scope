revised_title: 'Thermal Explosion and Times to Ignition in Systems with Distributed Temperatures: IV. Behavior at Points of Criticality and Transition'
semantic_tags:
  - Thermal explosion
  - Times to ignition
  - Distributed temperatures
  - Criticality
  - Transition
tldr: This article investigates the behavior of distributed temperature systems under critical conditions, focusing on the approach to critical and transitional steady-state profiles. The authors consider general reaction kinetics and arbitrary geometry and Biot numbers, providing a comprehensive analysis of the evolution in time for these systems.
