tldr: The author demonstrates that the zero-energy scattering phase-shift is (n + m), where n is the number of composite bound states of the impacted and incident particles, and m is the number of states from which the incident particle is excluded by the Pauli principle. This relationship is shown to hold for various atomic and nuclear scattering cases, including electron-hydrogen and neutron-triton collisions.
