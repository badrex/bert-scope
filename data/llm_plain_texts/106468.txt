tldr: 'Abraham Brook describes a new electrometer, an instrument used to measure electric charge. The device features a glass support, two copper balls, and a dial plate with a graduated circle. The electrometer can detect the repulsive power of electric charges and determine the weight in grains that the repulsive force can lift. This instrument provides a more accurate and universal language for understanding and comparing electric charges.'
