tldr: The author investigates the dispersion of matter in turbulent flow through a pipe, introducing a virtual coefficient of diffusion to describe the combined action of velocity variation and molecular diffusion. The study verifies the theoretical predictions with experiments in both smooth and rough pipes, and discusses the effects of pipe curvature on dispersion.
