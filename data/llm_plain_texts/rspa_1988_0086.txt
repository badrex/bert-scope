tldr: This study investigates the impact of different plasma gases on flame kernel development in lean methane-air mixtures. By measuring the two-dimensional distribution of hydroxyl (OH) concentration using laser-induced fluorescence, the authors found that chemically active plasmas promote combustion in non-flammable sub-limit mixtures, increasing the rate of combustion and extending the flammability limits.
