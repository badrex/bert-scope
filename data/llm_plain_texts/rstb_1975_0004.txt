tldr: The study examines the color receptors and synaptic connections in the retina of a cyprinid fish, specifically the rudd (Scardinius erythrophthalmus). It identifies three main types of cone cells that underlie the fish's trichromacy and provides evidence for the chromatic identities of these cones. The research also investigates the patterns of synaptic connections between these cones and retinal rods, as well as the interactions between the different color channels in the retina.
