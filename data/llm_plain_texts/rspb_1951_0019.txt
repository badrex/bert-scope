tldr: This article discusses the role of alkali-metal ions, such as potassium and rubidium, in the metabolism of bacteria. The authors found that these ions are connected with the presence of certain intermediates involved in the degradation of carbon substrates. They also discovered that the ions help protect the cell against adverse pH conditions by maintaining a concentration gradient and buffering the cell against the action of hydrions. The mechanism of this protective action involves the binding of the ions to enzymes, which endows them with the power to displace hydrion and antagonize its adverse effects on enzyme activity.
