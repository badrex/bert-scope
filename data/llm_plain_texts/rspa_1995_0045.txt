tldr: This study investigates the conversion of platelets in type IaB diamonds into dislocation loops and the formation of voidites through high-temperature annealing. The experiments reveal that platelets are converted into interstitial {011} dislocation loops and voidites are formed. The conversion process is enhanced when diamonds are heated under graphite-stable conditions. The disappearance of X-ray extra reflections, B' local-mode absorption, and the D spectrum is observed after the conversion of platelets, suggesting that voidites associated with dislocation loops are formed during this process.
