revised_title: On the Displacement of a Rigid Body in Space by Rotations

tldr: The author investigates the displacement of a rigid body in space by means of rotations and discusses the laws connecting pairs of axes for a given displacement. The study compares these findings with Rodrigues' classic memoir and presents the locus of either axis as a plane, generating a ruled quadric surface.
