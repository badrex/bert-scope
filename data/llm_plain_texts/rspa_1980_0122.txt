tldr: This article presents an empirical correlation between bedload transport rates in flumes and natural rivers. The author finds that the transport rate varies as a function of stream power, flow depth, and grain size. This correlation helps to understand the dynamics of sediment transport in rivers and flumes, providing valuable insights into fluid mechanics and river dynamics.
