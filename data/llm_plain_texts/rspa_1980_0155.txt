tldr: The authors study the distribution of stress and velocity in an ice strip that is partly sliding and partly adhering to its bed using a Newtonian viscous approximation. They find that stress singularities at the no-slip to perfect-slip junction can account for high gravel concentration near the ice borehole bottom. The study also provides numerical results for stress and velocity representations and discusses the limitations of the theory.
