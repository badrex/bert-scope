tldr: This study investigates the role of radiation in the development of resistance to streptomycin in bacteria. The researchers found that natural radiation plays a significant part in the process, leading to an increase in the proportion of streptomycin-resistant mutants. The findings suggest that radiation-induced mutations may be responsible for the negative type of drug resistance, where the bacteria have deficiencies that make them resistant to the drug.
