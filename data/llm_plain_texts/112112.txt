tldr: The authors conducted research on the acids of the lactic series and studied the action of zincethyl on ethylic leucate. They discovered that zincethyl reacts with ethylic leucate in two stages, producing zincethylo-ethylate and ethylate of zinc. This reaction sheds light on the production of ethylic leucate from zincethyl and ethylic oxalate.
