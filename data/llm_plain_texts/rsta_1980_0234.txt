tldr: This article discusses the radio emission from solar flares, focusing on the impulsive phase and type III bursts. It reviews recent microwave and X-ray observations and presents two models for the impulsive phase: the non-thermal model and the quasi-thermal model. The article also explores the generation of type III bursts, which are produced by energetic electrons streaming through the corona and interplanetary medium, and the mechanism of radiation. In situ measurements and radio observations are analyzed, and conclusions are drawn about electron beam characteristics and the accelerating mechanisms involved.
