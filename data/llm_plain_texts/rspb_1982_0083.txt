tldr: This study investigates the role of maltose transfer from algae to animal in the green hydra symbiosis. The researchers found that maltose is the primary form of organic carbon transferred between the symbiotic partners. They compared two types of Chlorella strains, high releasers and low releasers, and found that high releasers transfer at least ten times more maltose to the hydra. The study suggests that maltose transfer plays a key role in the symbiosis, but the amount of maltose released does not determine the eventual symbiont population size.
