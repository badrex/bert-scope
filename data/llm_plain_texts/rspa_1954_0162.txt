tldr: The authors investigate the electronic structure and stability of metallic borides using the tight-binding approximation. They predict that if a metal has a valency of 2 or less, the crystal will be an insulator or photoconductor, while if the valency is greater than 2, the crystal will exhibit metallic conductivity. The authors analyze the interactions between site orbitals in the crystal and find that the borides have a closed-shell structure, which contributes to their chemical stability and hardness.
