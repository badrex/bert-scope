tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine if trypanosomes, a type of parasitic protozoa, have an ultra-microscopical stage in their life cycle. They found that filtered blood from infected animals did not contain ultra-microscopical forms of the trypanosomes, and cultures of the parasites on blood agar also did not produce such forms. This research helps to better understand the life cycle and transmission of these parasites, which cause diseases like nagana and surra in animals.
