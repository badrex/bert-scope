tldr: The author investigates the geometrical properties of elliptic integrals and their applications in determining the length of curves formed by the intersection of surfaces of the second order. They discover that when surfaces are symmetrically placed and concentric, the problem can be simplified to an elliptic integral, but the general problem remains unsolved, highlighting the vast potential for future discoveries in integral calculus.
