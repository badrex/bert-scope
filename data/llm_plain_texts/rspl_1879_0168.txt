tldr: Researchers G. D. Liveing and J. Dewar discovered a new spectrum in water by analyzing the light emitted from flames. They found that the spectrum, which extends between the lines S and R of the solar spectrum, appears in the flames of various gases, including hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and carbonic acid. The spectrum is also present in the electric spark taken in moist gases. The researchers concluded that the spectrum is that of water and discussed its implications for understanding the emissive power of gaseous substances at low flame temperatures.
