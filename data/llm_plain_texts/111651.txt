tldr: "In this study, W. Thomson investigates the electromotive force required to produce a spark between parallel metal plates at different distances. He discovered that greater electromotive force per unit length of air is needed to create a spark at short distances than at long distances. This finding challenges the understanding of the time and raises questions about the behavior of electric forces in air."
