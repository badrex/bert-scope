tldr: The authors studied the activation energy and frequency factor for the conversion of para-hydrogen on tungsten. They found that these values are independent of factors like wire length, bath temperature, and thickness. The results showed a linear relation between activation energy and frequency factor, which is supported by the different slope obtained when the tungsten wire is 'poisoned' with carbon monoxide and other gases. The tungsten-hydrogen conversion system is considered a simple system for studying heterogeneous catalysis.
