tldr: The authors isolated and characterized proteins from the left colleterial gland of the cockroach, focusing on the predominant proteins of the egg-case. They found that the water-insoluble protein fraction contains two major and one minor protein, while the water-soluble protein fraction contains three major proteins. The molecular weights and amino acid compositions of these proteins were determined, revealing similarities to silk proteins and suggesting a role in the formation of sclerotin, a structural material found in insect exoskeletons.
