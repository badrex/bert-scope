tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of radium rays on rat sarcoma cells. They found that exposing the cells to radium rays for a certain period slowed down or prevented their growth. The longer the exposure, the more effective the radiation in stopping tumor growth. This research contributed to the understanding of cancer treatment using radiation therapy.
