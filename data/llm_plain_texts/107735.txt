tldr: The author presents a general method for calculating the angles made by any planes of crystals and the laws according to which they are formed. By using a mathematical process and considering the co-existent planes, the author demonstrates how to deduce the properties of various types of crystals. This method can be applied to a wide range of crystal structures, providing valuable insights into their formation and properties.
