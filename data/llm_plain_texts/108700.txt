tldr: The author conducted a series of observations on the Mer de Glace glacier to study its motion and the influence of valley curvature. They discovered that the point of maximum motion shifts towards the side of the glacier where the valley turns its convex curvature. This finding helps to explain the differences in glacier motion and crevasse formation patterns observed in various locations.
