tldr: The author investigates the crystallographic and optical properties of monoclinic double selenates of the cadmium group. They study three salts containing rubidium, caesium, and ammonium and find that these salts have similar crystal angles and elements. The optical constants, such as refractive indices and the position of the optic axes, are determined for these salts, providing insights into their behavior and potential applications.
