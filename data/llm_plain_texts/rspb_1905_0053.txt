tldr: The author investigates the mechanism of fermentation and enzyme action in various yeasts. They found that all tested yeasts could ferment glucose, mannose, and fructose, but many were unable to ferment galactose. The author suggests that the fermentation of different sugars may involve different mechanisms and that the process of enzymo-hydrolysis and fermentation are related but distinct phenomena.
