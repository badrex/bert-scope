tldr: The author studied the horn-destroying fungus, Onygena equina, and discovered its life cycle and infection mechanism. They found that the fungus's spores require digestion in gastric juice to germinate and grow into mycelia capable of infecting horn. The research has implications for understanding the decomposition of hair, horn, feathers, and hoofs used as manure in agriculture.
