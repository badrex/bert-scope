tldr: The author investigated the origin of uric acid in the animal body and found that it is formed by the kidney cells as ammonium urate. Uric acid in the blood is in the form of sodium urate, and its presence is often due to a small absorption of ammonium urate from the kidneys into the blood. The daily quantity of uric acid secreted by animals varies greatly, and the author's research supports the hypothesis that uric acid is produced by the kidney cells.
