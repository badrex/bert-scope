tldr: This article discusses the unique anatomy of Hatteria, a reptile with distinct features such as a persistent skull suture, modified vertebral column, and specialized dentition. Hatteria's skull has a complete orbital ring and a robust columella, while its vertebral column has amphicelian vertebrae and modified costal hemipophyses. The reptile's dentition is also unique, with intermaxillaries armed with cutting teeth and a series of palatine teeth parallel to the maxillary series. Hatteria's structure represents a combination of high and low organization, making it the type of a distinct group of reptiles.
