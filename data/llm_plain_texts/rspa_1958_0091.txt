tldr: The authors investigated the variation of the magnetic leakage field in cobalt with temperature using an electron beam. They found that the strength of the magnetic leakage field decreases steadily with increasing temperature, becoming negligible at around 250°C. The basic domain spacings did not change during heating or cooling of the crystal. This study provides insights into the magnetic properties of cobalt and its potential applications in various temperature conditions.
