tldr: The authors identified a fused mitochondrial gene (Pcf) associated with Petunia cytoplasmic male sterility and compared it with normal mitochondrial genes in fertile and sterile plants. They found that Pcf gene transcripts were four to five times higher in anthers than in leaves of the sterile plants, suggesting a link between mitochondrial biogenesis and cytoplasmic male sterility.
