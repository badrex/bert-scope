tldr: The authors studied stationary flames of methyl nitrate and methyl nitrite to understand their decomposition and combustion processes. They maintained a stationary decomposition flame of methyl nitrate at low pressures and observed distinct zones of reaction. The results were analyzed using emission and absorption spectroscopy, providing insights into the reluctance of nitric oxide to react and the occurrence of pyrolytic reactions in flames.
