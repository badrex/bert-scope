tldr: The author, Sir W. Petty, compares the size and population of London, Paris, Rome, and other cities, asserting that London is the largest city in the world. He addresses objections from French scholars and provides data on housing and population density to support his claims. Petty also discusses the economic importance of London as an emporium.
