tldr: 'This article describes the discovery of nine new species of archaeogastropod limpets from hydrothermal vents, belonging to the newly established superfamily Lepetodrilacea. These limpets are found in deep-sea hydrothermal-vent habitats in the eastern Pacific and have unique characteristics, such as sexual dimorphism and distinct anatomies. The article provides systematic descriptions of the new species and discusses their relationships with other living gastropods and potential fossil affinities.'
