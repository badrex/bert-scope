tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effect of heat on the chloride, bromide, and iodide of silver. They developed an apparatus to measure the coefficients of expansion and contraction of these compounds. The author discovered that the iodide of silver has three allotropic modifications and found the coefficients of expansion for the chloride, bromide, and iodide of silver. This research contributed to the understanding of the physical and chemical properties of these compounds.
