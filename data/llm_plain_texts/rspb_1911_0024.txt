  - Homologues
tldr: The authors compared the effects of various local anaesthetics, including cocaine, stovaine, and their homologues, on nerve conduction. They found that stovaine blocks nerve conductivity more rapidly and lasts longer than equimolecular solutions of cocaine hydrochloride. The study also showed that the rate of recovery of the nerve is influenced by factors such as concentration of the drug, temperature, and duration of the drug bath.
