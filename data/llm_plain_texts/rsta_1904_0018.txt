tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the specific heats of metals and their compounds, comparing the results to Neumann's law. They found that the specific heat of a solid is determined by the nature of its atoms, and that the atomic heat in the liquid state is generally greater than in the solid state. The experiments confirmed that Neumann's law is approximately valid for specific heats at all temperatures.
