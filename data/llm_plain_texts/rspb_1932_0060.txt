tldr: The oxygen affinity of chlorocruorin, a pigment found in the blood of certain polychaete worms, was studied using a spectrophotometric technique. The results showed that the oxygen dissociation curves of chlorocruorin are similar to those of haemoglobin, and its oxygen affinity is affected by temperature and hydrogen ion concentration, similar to mammalian haemoglobin. This research is essential for understanding the function of chlorocruorin in the life of animals possessing this pigment.
