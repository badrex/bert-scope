tldr: This article discusses the author's investigation into the reactions of bacteria, specifically the B. coli group, and the rhythmic contractility of the spleen. The author uses a new method to observe changes in bacterial reactions and the spleen's response to alterations in blood pressure. The article also mentions a new pathogenic anaerobic bacillus discovered in humans.
