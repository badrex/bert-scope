tldr: The authors determined the oxidation-reduction equivalent of cytochrome c and the concentration of haematin iron in the pigment. They used two methods to estimate the haematin iron, and found that it was equal to the total iron in the cytochrome c preparations. The reduction of oxidized cytochrome c by ferrous tartrate was nearly quantitative and involved one equivalent per haematin equivalent of cytochrome c. The authors also showed that the preparations of cytochrome c obtained from baker's yeast were free from inorganic iron.
