tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the recovery heat-production in oxygen after a series of muscle twitches. They found a mean ratio of oxidative to anaerobic heat of 2.07, which led to an "oxidative quotient" of 4.81. This value is close to the latest determination made by Meyerhof and Schulz using a different method. The results suggest that lactic acid plays a significant role in the theory of muscular contraction.
