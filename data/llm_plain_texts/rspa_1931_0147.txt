tldr: This article discusses the reflection and diffraction of X-rays, exploring the theories of reflection and refraction, and presenting experimental findings on the reflection of X-rays by various materials. The authors also investigate the use of ruled gratings to diffract X-rays at larger angles than previously assumed, and they analyze the intensity of reflection at these angles.
