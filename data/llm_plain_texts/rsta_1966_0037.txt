tldr: The study investigates the initial stages of deformation in metals subjected to repeated liquid impact, focusing on the formation of small plastic depressions and the role of surface loading. The research compares the effects of liquid impact and hydrodynamic loading conditions due to shock waves in a liquid, and discusses the influence of high-velocity liquid flow across the impacted surface.
