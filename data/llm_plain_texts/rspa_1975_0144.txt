tldr: Researchers used electron microscopy to study the melting points of small lead particles. They found that smaller particles generally melt at lower temperatures, but there is an additional effect causing a variation in melting points for particles of the same size. This study provides insights into the properties of nanoparticles and the role of surface energy in their melting behavior.
