tldr: The authors conducted experiments with phosphonium chloride, a compound formed by mixing phosphine and hydrochloric acid gases. They studied the dissociable process and the critical state of the compound, finding that it behaves differently than other gas mixtures. The research also discovered a crystalline hydrate of phosphine when the gas is liquefied in the presence of water.
