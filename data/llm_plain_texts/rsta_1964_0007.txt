tldr: The article presents a theory for the diffusion of fluids through highly elastic, isotropic solids. It assumes that each point of the solid-fluid mixture is occupied simultaneously by all constituents and formulates equations of motion and continuity for each substance. The theory is applied to examine steady-state problems, including the swelling of a solid due to the presence of fluid, diffusion through uniformly stretched plates, and diffusion through sheared slabs.
