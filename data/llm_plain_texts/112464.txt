tldr: The author conducted research on hydrocarbons of the series CnH2n+2 and focused on di-isopropyl and amyl-isopropyl. They discovered the reaction between di-isopropyl and sodium, and the formation of di-isopropyl chloride and amyl-isopropyl chloride. The author also studied the oxidation of these hydrocarbons, finding that they produce carbonic acid and acetic acid.
