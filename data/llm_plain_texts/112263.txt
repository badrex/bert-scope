tldr: John P. Gassiot conducted experiments on the stratified appearance in electrical discharges using various vacuum tubes and batteries. He discovered that the discharge of the battery was more sensitive to the state of tension in the vacuum tubes, and that the true theory of electricity might not be fully understood without experimenting with well-insulated batteries. Gassiot's findings could potentially improve our understanding of electrical discharges and battery technology.
