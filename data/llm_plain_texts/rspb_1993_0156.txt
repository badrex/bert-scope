tldr: 'The study investigates the action of acetylcholine (ACh) in Aplysia buccal muscle cells. ACh activates chloride channels, leading to inhibitory junction potentials. This research demonstrates that ACh can act as an inhibitory transmitter in neuromuscular systems, providing insights into the role of ACh in the central nervous system of invertebrates.'
