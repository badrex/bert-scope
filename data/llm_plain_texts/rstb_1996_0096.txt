tldr: This article discusses the ecological roles and importance of cephalopods in the world's oceans. It highlights their unique biology, diverse lifestyles, and resilience to environmental fluctuations. Cephalopods play a crucial role in the marine food chain, consuming a wide variety of prey and serving as a significant food source for other species. The article also explores the potential for future exploitation of cephalopod species as fish stocks decline and the impact of their presence on the distribution of chemicals and energy in the ocean.
