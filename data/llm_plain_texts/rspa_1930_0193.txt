tldr: The authors describe improvements to the optical pyrometer, a device used to measure high temperatures. They discuss the design of a magnifying pyrometer, which allows for better temperature measurements by magnifying small sources of light. They also develop a special composite glass filter to improve the accuracy of temperature readings in arc conditions. Additionally, they present a method for calibrating the pyrometer using an electrically heated wedge as a blackbody source.
