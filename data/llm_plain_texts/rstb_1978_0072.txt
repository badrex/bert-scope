tldr: 'This article presents a new classification system for the Pteriomorphia subclass of bivalve molluscs based on morphology and morphoclines. The authors analyze the evolution of primitive and derived character states in groups previously included in the subclass Pteriomorphia and propose a new phylogenetic classification separating these groups into three superorders within the subclass Autobranchia. The study also challenges some long-held morphological concepts and provides a new understanding of the evolution of bivalve molluscs.'
