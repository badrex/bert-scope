  - Honeybee behavior

  - Olfactory communication
  - Insect social life
tldr: 'Researchers H. Kalmus, C. R. Ribbands, and V. B. Wigglesworth discovered that honeybees can distinguish their colony members by their unique odors. These odors help bees recognize and preferentially attract members of their own colony. The origin of these odors is due to metabolic differences between colonies, which can be influenced by factors like food supply and breeding rhythms. This study sheds light on the role of olfactory recognition in the social life of honeybees.'
