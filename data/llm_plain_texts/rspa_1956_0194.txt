tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the torsion of zinc crystals to study the fundamental slip process in crystals having a single active slip plane. They discovered that flexural rotational slip occurs, which is a deformation process that involves slip on the (0001) planes. This process explains the anisotropic behavior of crystals during torsion and the external shape of twisted crystals.
