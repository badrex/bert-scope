tldr: This study investigates the effects of adaptation and masking on human vision, using both visual evoked potentials and psychophysical methods. The authors present a model that explains how adapting and masking gratings alter the psychophysical threshold for detecting a test grating, incorporating two distinct tuning functions: a broad adaptive contrast function and a narrow effective contrast function. This model accounts for various experimental findings, including the location and size of the facilitative dip in masking functions and the constant slopes of adaptation functions.
