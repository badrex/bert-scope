tldr: The study investigates the relationship between current reproductive effort and future reproductive success in blue tits. By delaying breeding attempts, researchers found that manipulated birds experienced reproductive costs in terms of decreased survival and lower subsequent reproductive success. The study suggests that time and/or energy constraints during moult could be the mechanism linking reproductive activities in one season to future reproductive success.
