tldr: 'This study investigates the critical frequency of flicker and its relation to the adaptation of the eye. The authors found that dark adaptation lowers the fusion frequency, and that this effect can be observed in both foveal and peripheral observations. The results provide insight into the physiological factors affecting the critical frequency and contribute to the understanding of visual perception and adaptation.'
