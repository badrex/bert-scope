  - Photo-ionization
  - Geomagnetic field
tldr: This article analyzes measurements of electron temperature in the F-region of the ionosphere to calculate the energy input required to maintain the temperature difference between electrons and the neutral atmosphere. The results show that the energy input is consistent with photo-ionization during the daytime, and a separate energy input from particles is observed at night. The study provides insights into the heating mechanisms and temperature variations in the ionosphere.
