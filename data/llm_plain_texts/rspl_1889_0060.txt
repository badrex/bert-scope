tldr: The author studied the influence of stress and strain on the physical properties of iron, nickel, and cobalt, focusing on magnetic induction and internal friction. The research involved using magnetic cycles of very minute range and the "ballistic" method of observation. The findings showed that the dissipation of energy from internal friction in magnetic cycles is independent of the rate at which the cycle is performed and is proportional to the cube of the maximum magnetizing force in the cycle. The internal friction of these metals can be affected by various factors, such as mechanical shocks, changes in temperature, and magnetization beyond certain limits.
