tldr: This article discusses frequency-dependent selection, a phenomenon where predators tend to concentrate on common prey varieties and overlook rare ones. This selection can lead to the maintenance of polymorphism, the simultaneous occurrence of multiple inherited phenotypes within a population. The author explores the causes and mechanisms of frequency-dependent selection, including the role of search images and optimal foraging theory, and presents evidence from various experiments.
