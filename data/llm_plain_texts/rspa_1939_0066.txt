tldr: The author explains the behavior of copper-cuprous oxide photocells by considering the contact between a metal and a semiconductor. They propose that when the contact is illuminated, electrons are ejected from the full band of the oxide into the empty conduction band, creating a photo-electromotive force. This theory helps to understand the observed electromotive force and current in the photocells.
