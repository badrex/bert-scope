tldr: The authors investigated the electric organ of the skate and discovered an electric center in the spinal cord. They found that the electric center in the skate is similar to the electric center in Gymnotus, but with fewer cells and a shorter electric tract. The study provides insights into the development and structure of the electric organ and its nervous apparatus.
