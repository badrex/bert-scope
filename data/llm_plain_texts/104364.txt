tldr: 'In this article, Henry Beighton introduces the Plotting-Table, an improved instrument for taking plans and maps in surveying. The table allows for easy and accurate plotting of maps, addressing previous difficulties in shifting papers and ensuring the stability of the table. Beighton also discusses the benefits of using the Plotting-Table over other surveying instruments, such as its speed, ease of use, and certainty in measurements.'
