tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of X-rays on cloudy condensation. They found that X-rays increase the number of condensation drops, suggesting that they create nuclei similar to those present in the atmosphere. This discovery expanded the understanding of cloud formation and the role of X-rays in atmospheric science.
