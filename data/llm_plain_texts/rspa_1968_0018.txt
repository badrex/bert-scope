tldr: The authors discuss the use of electron spin resonance (ESR) to study reactive intermediates in chemical reactions. They demonstrate the technique's application in measuring reaction rates for radical anions in various molecules, such as tetraphenylethylene, 1,1-diphenylethylene, and 1,1-diphenylacetylene. The ESR technique allows researchers to observe changes in radical ion concentrations over time, providing valuable insights into reaction mechanisms and activation energies.
