tldr: The author discusses the effect of ether drift on the refraction and reflection of light. They analyze the angles of incidence and reflection and conclude that the ordinary laws of refraction and reflection are not always obeyed due to the ether's motion. The author suggests that the effect of ether drift on terrestrial sources could be examined by observing the motion of the ether near the Earth.
