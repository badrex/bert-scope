tldr: This article discusses the development of furnace atomic non-thermal excitation spectrometry (FANES) for the determination of non-metal elements at trace levels in various samples. FANES combines a hollow cathode discharge inside an electrothermal atomizer tube, allowing for the excitation of both non-metals and metallic impurities. The technique has been applied to the determination of elements such as B, Cl, P, and Si in industrial and clinical samples, demonstrating its potential for improved sensitivity and analysis.
