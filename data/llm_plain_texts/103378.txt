tldr: 'In January 1719/20, a luminous appearance was observed in the sky over Dublin. The author, Philip Percival, described the event in detail, noting its resemblance to the Aurora Borealis. The phenomenon began as long streams of light, which eventually formed into various shapes and colors before dispersing into small, thin light clouds. Percival observed the event for over a quarter of an hour and drew a sketch of it the next morning.'
