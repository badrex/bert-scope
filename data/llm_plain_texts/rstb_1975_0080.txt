tldr: This article discusses the physics and chemistry of biological recognition, focusing on cell communication in Dictyostelium discoideum through periodic cyclic-AMP pulses. The authors describe the mechanisms of signal relaying, chemotaxis, and the role of cyclic-AMP in cell aggregation and development. They also explore the similarities between cellular communication in Dictyostelium and synaptic transmission in higher organisms.
