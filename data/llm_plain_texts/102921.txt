tldr: The author, William Derham, shares his observations and those of his friend Richard Towneley about the atmospheric conditions and a severe storm that occurred in November 1704. They discuss the impact of preceding wet and warm seasons on the storm's development, as well as the role of barometers in measuring its intensity. They also mention unusual phenomena, such as salt-tasting plants and fumes, caused by the storm.
