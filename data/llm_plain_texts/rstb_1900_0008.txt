tldr: The author investigates the development of enamel in fish teeth, particularly in Placental Mammals and Plagiostome fishes. They discovered a unique process of enamel formation in fish, where a thick organic matrix is deposited before calcification, and a reticulated stroma prepares the full dimensions of the enamel cap. This research provides insights into the differences and similarities between fish and mammalian enamel formation.
