tldr: This article discusses the light absorption properties of vitamin B12 and its related compounds. The authors use molecular orbital calculations and spectroscopy to study the electronic transitions and intensities of corrin, a ligand in metal complexes. Their findings can help chemists understand the structure and properties of these complexes, including the rates of substitution reactions and bond distances.
