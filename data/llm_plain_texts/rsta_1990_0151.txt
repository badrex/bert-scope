tldr: 'The article discusses the use of redox mediator modified glucose oxidase in amperometric enzyme electrodes. The authors study the stability and performance of ferrocene monocarboxylic acid, ferrocene acetic acid, tetrathiafulvalene, and tetracyanoquinodimethane modified glucose oxidase in membrane enzyme electrodes for glucose. They found that these modified enzymes have potential for use in biosensors and bioelectronics due to their ability to be oxidized at modest overpotentials without requiring a freely diffusing mediator.'
