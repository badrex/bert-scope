tldr: This study investigates the role of yolk accumulation and other factors in the development and evolution of tunicates, using a variety of closely related species. The research examines the origin of viviparity, cell size, and development in each family of ascidians, as well as the effects of yolk accumulation and other factors on development. The observations were made at marine biological stations and aquariums, with preserved material examined at McGill University.
