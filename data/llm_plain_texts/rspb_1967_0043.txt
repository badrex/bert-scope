tldr: This article discusses the relationship between penicillin and N-acetylmuramic acid in the binding site of lysozyme. The authors explore the possibility of a structural similarity between penicillin and N-acetylmuramic acid, which may explain the antibiotic action of penicillin. They also consider the role of the large hydrophobic phenyl group in complex formation and the potential impact of these findings on understanding the mode of action of penicillin.
