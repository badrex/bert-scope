tldr: The author conducted a series of experiments to measure the gas evolved from the thermal springs at Bath and to determine if there were any significant diurnal variations in its quantity. The average quantity of gas evolved per minute was found to be 267 cubic inches, with a total daily volume of 223 cubic feet. The author suggests that the gases may be coming from a large volume trapped in a cavern below the surface of the earth, heated by volcanic action in the past. The composition of the gases, with a high volume of nitrogen and no carburetted, sulphuretted, or phosphuretted hydrogen, supports the idea that they are not derived from atmospheric air.
