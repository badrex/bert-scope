tldr: Researchers conducted experiments with captive fallow deer to understand whether mate choice copying or aggregation is responsible for skewed distributions of females on leks. They found that oestrous females prefer to join males with established harems, but this preference is not based on the males' phenotypic characteristics or previous mating activity. The results suggest that female attraction to other females on the lek is an adaptation to avoid harassment in mixed-sex herds.
