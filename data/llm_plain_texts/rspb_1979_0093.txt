tldr: The study investigates the effect of maternal administration of vitamin A on neural tube defects in curly-tail mice, which have a genetic predisposition to these defects. The researchers found that vitamin A, a known teratogen, caused more neural tube defects in the curly-tail mice compared to a control strain when given on day 8 of pregnancy. The severity of the defects increased with higher doses of vitamin A. This study highlights the importance of understanding gene-environment interactions and the potential risks of vitamin A exposure during pregnancy.
