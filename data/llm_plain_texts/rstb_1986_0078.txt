tldr: This study examines the plant species that have effectively colonized spoil habitats in the Sheffield region, focusing on the characteristics and circumstances of this colonization. The research finds that the most frequent components of spoil vegetation are perennial herbaceous species, many of which are grasses. A distinctive group of colonists within the spoil flora consists of species that exploit inhospitable substrates, such as cinders and lead-mine spoil. The study concludes that the characteristics of spoil colonization in the Sheffield region are consistent with the 'infection pressure' theory and are a symptom of massive changes occurring throughout the landscape due to disruptive land-use and eutrophication.
