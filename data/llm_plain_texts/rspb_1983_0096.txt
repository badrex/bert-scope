tldr: The study investigates the inheritance of size and shape in a population of Darwin's finches, specifically the Large Cactus Ground Finch (Geospiza conirostris). The research finds high heritabilities for various morphological traits, suggesting a strong potential for evolutionary change in the population. The findings also indicate that the population may have been subject to disruptive selection followed by stabilizing selection.
