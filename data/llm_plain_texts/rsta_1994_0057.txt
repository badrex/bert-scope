tldr: The article models stock price fluctuations as a sequence of temporary equilibria in a financial market with different types of agents. It introduces a class of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes in a random environment, which appears in the diffusion limit, and shows how the random environment can be generated by the interaction of a large set of agents modeled by Markov chains. This approach provides a framework for understanding complex phenomena in financial markets, such as price bubbles, crashes, and the impact of different types of traders.
