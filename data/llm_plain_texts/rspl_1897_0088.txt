tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the effect of very low temperatures on seed germination. They found that seeds exposed to temperatures between -183°C to -192°C for over 100 hours showed no difference in germination power compared to control seeds. This suggests that the protoplasm of resting seeds can enter a state of complete inertness, capable of supporting significant temperature drops without affecting their ability to germinate.
