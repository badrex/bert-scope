tldr: This article discusses the mechanism of action of penicillin and related cephalosporins, which are active site-directed acylating agents. The authors provide evidence supporting the substrate analogue hypothesis, showing that these antibiotics inactivate bacterial cell wall biosynthesis enzymes by binding covalently and forming acyl-enzyme intermediates. The study focuses on penicillin-sensitive enzymes, carboxypeptidases, and their interactions with penicillin, offering insights into the antibiotics' clinical effectiveness and their role in studying bacterial cell wall biosynthesis.
