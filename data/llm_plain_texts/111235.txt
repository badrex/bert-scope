tldr: This study investigates the distribution of blood vessels in the lungs, focusing on the pulmonary and bronchial arteries. The author found that the pulmonary artery does not connect with other arteries, while the bronchial arteries have their own separate distribution. The bronchial membrane is richly supplied with a unique vascular plexus, which ultimately connects to the pulmonary veins. The study also discusses the injection process and the apparatus used to observe the blood vessels in the lungs.
