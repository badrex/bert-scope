tldr: This article discusses the psychological aspects of short-term and long-term memory, focusing on iconic memory, a very short-lasting form of storage that acts as a buffer for later selective operations. The author highlights the distinction between short-term and long-term memory and the debate between decay theorists and interference theorists, who argue about the importance of interference in forgetting.
