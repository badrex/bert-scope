tldr: The author investigates the properties and symmetries of regular polytopes in various dimensions, focusing on their vertices, edges, and bounding figures. They classify these polytopes as uniform and discuss their Archimedean and non-Archimedean categories. The study also explores the concept of reciprocity and the relationship between polytopes and their symmetries.
