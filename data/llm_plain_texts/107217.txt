tldr: The author conducted experiments on grafted trees to understand the impact of age on tree health and leaf function. They discovered that the debility and diseases of old tree varieties do not originate from defective action of the bark or alburnum but rather from an inability to produce leaves that can efficiently execute their natural office. This suggests a possible analogy between the leaves of trees and the lungs of animals in terms of their function and aging process.
