tldr: The authors determined the elastic moduli of Rochelle salt, a piezoelectric crystal, using a statical method. They conducted bending and twisting experiments on suitably cut beams and found that the crystal's elastic properties are closely related to its piezoelectric effect. The results provide a strain-energy function and a surface of elasticity for the crystal, which can be used to calculate the piezoelectric moduli.
