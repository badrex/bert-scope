tldr: 'This article presents research on solar physics, focusing on the positions and areas of sunspots observed at Kew during the years 1864, 1865, and 1866. The authors compare their findings with previous observations by other researchers, such as Carrington and Schwabe, to assess the accuracy and reliability of their measurements. They also discuss the spotted area of the sun's visible disk from 1832 to 1868 and analyze the patterns and trends in solar activity over time.'
