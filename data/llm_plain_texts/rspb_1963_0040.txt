tldr: The study investigates the effect of thiourea on a molluscan smooth muscle contraction. Thiourea, an inhibitor of the actomyosin contractile mechanism, abolishes contractile responses in the muscle when in a concentration of 0.5 to 0.6m. The research concludes that thiourea directly inhibits contractility in the living muscle by inhibiting the contractile and enzymic activity of the actomyosin contractile system.
