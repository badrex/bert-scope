tldr: In 1795 and 1796, a team led by Colonel Edward Williams, Captain William Mudge, and Mr. Isaac Dalby conducted a trigonometrical survey of the British coast by order of the Marquis Cornwallis. They used a small theodolite instrument to measure angles and create a series of triangles extending from Kent to the Land's End. This survey aimed to improve maps for military use and better understand the geography of the British coast.
