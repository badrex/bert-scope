tldr: The authors examine the coexistence curves of two binary liquid systems, carbon disulphide + nitromethane and cyclohexane + acetic anhydride, and find evidence of a diameter singularity. They develop a scaling theory for critical phenomena in binary liquid systems, incorporating the diameter singularity, and discuss its implications and potential future experiments.
