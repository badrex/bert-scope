tldr: The author investigates electrical interference phenomena and their relation to Newton's theory. They study the reflection and transmission of electrical waves in conductors with varying properties, using an electrometer and a special apparatus. The findings provide insights into the behavior of electrical waves and the potential applications of these phenomena in various fields.
