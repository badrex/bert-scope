tldr: This article explores the connection between the Faraday rotation of the plane of polarization and the Zeeman change of frequency of light vibrations in a magnetic field. The author concludes that these two phenomena are directly connected, independently of any other theory than general dispersion theory. This connection helps to understand the behavior of light in magnetic fields and the properties of substances.
