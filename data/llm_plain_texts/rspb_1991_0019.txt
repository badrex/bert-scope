tldr: This study examines the NMR relaxation characteristics of rubidium-87 in perfused rat salivary glands to evaluate its potential for measuring potassium fluxes across cell membranes in intact tissues. The researchers found that by separating the intra- and extracellular signals and analyzing their relaxation mechanisms, they could estimate unidirectional potassium fluxes in intact tissues, providing a basis for further research in this area.
