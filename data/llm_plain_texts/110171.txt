tldr: In this paper, Henry Kater describes the trigonometrical operations conducted between 1821 and 1823 to determine the difference in longitude between the Royal Observatories of Paris and Greenwich. The team used a theodolite to connect the meridians and measure distances, overcoming challenges like weather delays and the need for accurate base measurements. The methods employed for geodetical calculations and the influence of various factors on the accuracy of measurements are also discussed.
