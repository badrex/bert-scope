tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the scattering of light by liquid boundaries and its relation to surface tension. They discovered that clean liquid surfaces exhibit a bluish opalescence and that the scattered light is polarized. The study established a quantitative relationship between surface opalescence and surface tension of liquids, with implications for understanding the optical properties of liquid surfaces.
