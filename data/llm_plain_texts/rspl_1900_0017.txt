tldr: This article investigates the connection between the electrical properties and chemical composition of different types of glass. The authors conducted experiments on various glasses, including lead-potash, barium, and zinc-soda glasses, to understand how their resistance and capacity change with time and the process of annealing. They found that annealing significantly increases the specific resistance of glass, making it a better insulator. The study also compared the torsional elasticity of glass fibers, which could be useful for various applications in technology and engineering.
