tldr: The author conducted experiments on different tree species to study the ascent of sap and the role of leaves in tree growth. They discovered that the sap descends through the bark from the leaves, nourishing the tree. The author also found that the central vessels, distinct from the spiral tubes and common wood tubes, play a crucial role in transporting sap to the leaves. The experiments showed that leaves are essential for the tree's nutrition, and reducing their number can negatively impact the tree's health.
