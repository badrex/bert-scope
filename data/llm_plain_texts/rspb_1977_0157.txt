tldr: This article discusses the significance of the Spacelab project for studying the vestibular function in microgravity. The author explains the European and American approaches to the research, focusing on the effect of free fall on unitary and integrated vestibular activity. The study aims to investigate the changes in the rate of firing of single vestibular statoreceptors in bullfrogs and their responses to centrifuge spins during orbital flight. The research has implications for understanding space sickness and disorientation in astronauts and animals.
