tldr: 'William Rowan Hamilton's essay introduces the concept of the Principal Function, a transformation that simplifies the study of dynamics. The essay demonstrates the application of this function in problems of perturbation, including the motion of projectiles and ternary systems. Hamilton's method combines the principles of variations and partial differentials, potentially forming a separate branch of analysis called the Calculus of Principal Functions.'
