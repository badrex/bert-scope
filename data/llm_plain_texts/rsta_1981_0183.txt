tldr: This article discusses the circulation and fronts in continental shelf seas, focusing on the role of friction and density gradients in the movement of water. The authors explore the dynamics of shallow sea fronts and the impact of cross-frontal flows on the overall circulation. They also highlight the importance of considering factors such as Ekman numbers and bottom boundary conditions in understanding these processes.
