tldr: This study examines the relationship between landform and surface age on Aldabra Island, a coral atoll in the Indian Ocean. The research focuses on the surface morphometry, lithology, and surface age of the island, as well as the erosion processes that have shaped its landforms. The authors found that the most developed karst features occur on the oldest surfaces, and that weakly cemented rocks and the most soluble mineral components are eroding most rapidly. The study provides insights into the evolution of atolls and the ecological implications of landform changes on Aldabra Island.
