tldr: The authors explore the limitations of compound eye function and design in insects, specifically focusing on the role of transduction as a limiting factor. They argue that vision in compound eyes is not limited by photon shot noise at high light intensities but by the finite signal-to-noise ratio achievable by the transduction mechanism. The study also predicts that diurnal insects undersample by a factor of about 2 and that the information capacity of the eye increases with the frequency response of transduction.
