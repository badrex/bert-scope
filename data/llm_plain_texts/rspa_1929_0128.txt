tldr: This article describes the development of a new spectrometer for studying molecular structure in the infra-red spectrum. The authors use a combination of a grating and a rock salt prism to analyze the radiation and provide a detailed explanation of the apparatus and technique used in their experiments. The spectrometer is designed to deal with small separations in the fine structure, allowing for the study of triatomic molecules and the application of the newer quantum theory.
