tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the specific heat, compressibility, and other physical properties of aqueous mixtures and solutions, particularly alcohol and water. They found that certain properties reach a maximum deviation from their theoretical values between 30% and 45% alcohol by weight. The authors also discovered relationships between specific heat, heat produced by mixing, boiling point, and capillary attraction in these mixtures.
