tldr: The authors present a simplified calculation of the second Born approximation to the Bremsstrahlung cross-section. They demonstrate that certain parts of the matrix elements are not needed for the 'unpolarized' cross-section, simplifying the calculation. The authors also show that the same methods can be applied satisfactorily in the case of pair production.
