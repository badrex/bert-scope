tldr: This article presents a theory of metals, focusing on the interaction of electrons and the lattice in metal conduction. The author develops a method to treat the interaction consistently and applies it to the discussion of the theories of Bloch and Peierls. The study also considers the problems of dispersion and absorption of light in metals.
