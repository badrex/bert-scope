tldr: The photolysis of polyvinyl bromide (PVB) was studied in dry and aqueous tetrahydrofuran (THF) solutions. The blackening of PVB occurs due to the formation of a conjugated chain by the catalytic action of Br atoms. In the presence of water, the products change completely, and no blackening occurs. The reaction mechanism is discussed in terms of interrelated reactions, including the formation of graft copolymers and homopolymers.
