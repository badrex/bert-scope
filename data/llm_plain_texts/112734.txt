tldr: This article presents temperature observations taken during the sinking of the Rose Bridge Colliery in Wigan, Lancashire. The author, Edward Hull, discusses the increasing temperature and pressure at deeper levels and how it affects mining operations. The study also compares the temperature gradient in Rose Bridge Colliery with other coal mines, such as Dukenfield and Monkwearmouth, and suggests that the dissimilar results are due to differences in the position and inclination of the strata.
