tldr: Richard Dawkins responds to Lucy Sullivan's criticism of his book, The Selfish Gene, arguing that she misunderstood the concept of altruism and the role of genes in evolution. He emphasizes the importance of using anthropomorphic language to explain complex ideas and defends the book's central message that altruism can emerge from selfishness at the genetic level.
