tldr: The author analyzes the deformation of a cantilever struck transversely at its tip by a moving mass, assuming the material is rigid-plastic. Two special cases are considered: a heavy striker and a light striker. Experiments on model mild-steel cantilevers under these conditions show that a cantilever struck by a heavy striker remains straight, while a cantilever struck by a light striker suffers local deformation near the tip and a rotation at the root, which is inversely proportional to the cantilever length.
