tldr: This article reviews the development of ideas about the transport and distribution of ionospheric plasma in the magnetosphere. It discusses the convection/hot solar plasma model and the convection/loss model, which are incompatible explanations for low plasma densities outside the plasmasphere. The article explores recent progress in understanding global ionospheric outflows and their potential to help resolve this problem. It also examines the role of terrestrial and solar plasma sources in the magnetosphere.
