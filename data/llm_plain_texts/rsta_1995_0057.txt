tldr: This article investigates the high-frequency vibration and acoustic radiation of fluid-loaded plates, focusing on a model problem of a simply-supported plate excited by a random pressure field. The analysis yields a set of modal equations coupled by acoustic interaction terms, which are difficult to evaluate numerically at high frequencies and mode numbers. The authors derive asymptotic expressions for the acoustic coefficients, enabling computational solution of the full, coupled modal equations. They compare the results with the "diagonal approximation" (the solution when coupling is ignored) and provide an improved characterization of the physical nature of the acoustic coupling and conditions for its neglect.
