tldr: The author conducted a series of experiments to study the electromotive forces and voltaic action between different metals. They developed a bi-metallic quadrant electrometer to measure the difference of potential near two metals in contact. The author found that the difference in potential at the outer surfaces of the two films is measured, and they discussed the implications of their findings on the understanding of electromotive forces and voltaic action.
