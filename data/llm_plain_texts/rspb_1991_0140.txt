tldr: The authors investigated the effects of high-affinity fluorescent probes, such as Fura-2 and Indo-1, on intracellular free Ca2+ signals in cardiac muscle. They found that these probes can slow down and alter the amplitude and kinetics of Ca2+ transients, which can affect the action potential and contractile activity of the myocardium. This study highlights the importance of considering the potential impact of these indicators on the measured signals when interpreting experimental results.
