tldr: A letter from Somersetshire describes a strange frost that caused significant damage to trees and agriculture in the region. The freezing rain fell without any ice on nearby rivers or standing pools, making the event even more unusual. The frost damaged orchards, hedges, and trees along roads, making them impassable. The author suggests that a more systematic study of weather patterns and other phenomena could help predict and prevent future disasters.
