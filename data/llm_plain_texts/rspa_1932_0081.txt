tldr: This article presents an experimental investigation of the atomic scattering factor of iron using X-rays of various wavelengths. Powder photographs of an iron-aluminum alloy were taken with different radiations, and the intensities of the resulting lines were measured photometrically. The results show a significant drop in the atomic scattering power near the absorption edge and provide valuable insights into the behavior of iron under different X-ray wavelengths.
