tldr: The author investigates the stability of various adaptations in Bact. lactis aerogenes (Aerobacter aerogenes) and their relevance to drug resistance. They found that bacteria can adapt to different media, including those containing antibiotics, but the degree of permanence of these adaptations is complex. The author also discovered that drug resistance can be compatible with retention of the optimum growth rate in the original medium, but it may be lost over time. This research highlights the importance of understanding bacterial adaptation and its implications for drug resistance and potential treatments.
