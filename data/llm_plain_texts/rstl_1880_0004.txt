tldr: "The authors conducted experiments on the electric discharge using a silver chloride battery and measured the tube potential and resistance. They observed various phenomena of the electric arc and analyzed the potential necessary to produce a discharge between discs at constant distances and different pressures. Their findings contribute to the understanding of the forces involved in the production of complex electric discharge phenomena."
