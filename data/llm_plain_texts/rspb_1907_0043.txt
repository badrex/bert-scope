tldr: The authors conducted experiments to test the presence of opsonic amboceptors in normal serum. They found that heated serum, through which bacteria have been passed, exerts a marked inhibitory action on the opsonins of fresh normal serum. This suggests the presence of opsonic amboceptors in normal serum, which may affect phagocytosis.
