tldr: The author, Abraham de la Pryme, observed a spout in Yorkshire during a dry season with strong winds. The spout created a vortex, causing clouds to whirl and drop down in the shape of a thick, long black pipe. It moved slowly, bending trees and breaking branches, and eventually dissolving as the wind from the east prevailed. The spout's odd phenomenon was caused by the condensation and gravitation of clouds due to contrary winds meeting in a point or center.
