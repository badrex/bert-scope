tldr: The authors tested over 200 chemical compounds for their growth-inhibitory activity and carcinogenic properties. They found a strong correlation between the two, suggesting that carcinogenic compounds can interfere with normal cell growth. The study also explored the relationship between molecular structure and inhibitory activity, and the mode of production of the inhibitory effect. Some compounds showed enhanced inhibitory activity with reduced or no carcinogenicity, opening up possibilities for chemotherapy of cancer.
