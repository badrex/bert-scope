tldr: The author, Everard Home, investigates the effects of the sediment in the Colchicum Autumnale infusion on gout treatment. He finds that the sediment contributes to the violent operation of the medicine and induces him to believe that the violent effects on the stomach and bowels depend on a distinct substance contained in the sediment. Experiments on dogs confirm the identity of Eau medicinale with the infusion of Colchicum Autumnale and the role of the sediment in its effects.
