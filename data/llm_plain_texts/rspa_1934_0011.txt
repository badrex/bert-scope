revised_title: 'Sulphides Absorption Spectra and Heat of Dissociation of Sulphur'
semantic_tags:
  - Atomic Spectroscopy
  - Heat of Dissociation

  - Transition Metals
  - Atomic Transitions
tldr: The authors studied the absorption spectra of zinc, cadmium, and mercury sulphides and found that the experimental values of certain atomic transitions were approximate. They also discussed the heat of dissociation of sulphur in the state, which can be determined indirectly from the absorption data.
