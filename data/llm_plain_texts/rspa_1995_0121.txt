tldr: This article highlights the importance of Reynolds-average modelling in simulating turbulent exchange processes in hydraulic flows. It reviews the possible calculation approaches and discusses the turbulence models mainly in use for hydraulic calculations, focusing on extensions to account for free-surface effects and special depth-average versions. The article presents several calculation examples demonstrating the possibilities and impact of Reynolds-average-modelling in hydraulics.
