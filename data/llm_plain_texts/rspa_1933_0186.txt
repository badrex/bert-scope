tldr: The author investigates the interaction between hydrogen and nitrous oxide to determine if it is a chain reaction and analyzes its mechanism using the kinetic method. The study focuses on the effect of nitrous oxide's decomposition on the reaction rate and the role of water vapor as an inhibitor. The results provide insights into the understanding of combustion chemistry and chain reactions.
