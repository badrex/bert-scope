tldr: Joseph Priestley conducted experiments to understand the role of heat and light in the phlogistication of spirit of nitre. He found that heat, not light, was responsible for the color change in the acid. The experiments also showed that the process involved the emission of dephlogisticated air, suggesting that the acid became "phlogisticated" by releasing this component.
