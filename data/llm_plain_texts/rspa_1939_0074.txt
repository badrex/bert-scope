tldr: The authors analyze the optical properties of the transition layer between transparent media, specifically focusing on the amplitude, phase, and orientation of reflected light. They discuss the theories of Drude and Maclaurin, which are found to be identical in form and do not allow for the separation of thickness and refractive index of the transition layer. The minimum thickness of the adsorbed layer is derived by assuming the refractive index to be the geometric mean of the indices of the two media.
