tldr: This study examines the geomorphological and stratigraphical features of the Severn Estuary, revealing that it has experienced a sequence of horizontal movements over the last few thousand years. The research identifies four distinct lithostratigraphic units and geomorphic surfaces that have accumulated along the shores of the estuary. These formations provide evidence of the instability of the estuary's shores and the importance of horizontal movements in the area's history. The study sets the stage for further research into the factors controlling shoreline movement and the stability of other west-coast estuaries.
