tldr: The author investigates the presence of anomalous reflexions and diffuse spots in X-ray diffraction patterns, which cannot be explained by the simple theory of diffraction. They propose a simplified explanation for these effects, suggesting that they are caused by the diffraction pattern of small groups of atoms in close-packed arrays. This explanation is supported by the observation of similar patterns in other crystals, such as KC1 and NaCl.
