tldr: This article investigates the electrochemical arc machining (ECAM) process, which combines features of electrochemical and electrodischarge machining. The authors analyze the stochastic nature of ECAM, focusing on the mechanisms of electrochemical dissolution and electrodischarge erosion. They use stochastic models to describe the process and interpret the model parameters to better understand the behavior of ECAM. The study provides insights into the effects of various machining process variables on the type, intensity, and duration of the resulting phases.
