tldr: The author analyzed the barometrical averages in London from 1815 to 1832, observing the influence of the moon's declination on the climate. He found that there is a gradation of effect in the lunar influence, which operates through an eighteen-year cycle. The sun's varying influence prevents a simple pattern from forming, making the problem complex.
