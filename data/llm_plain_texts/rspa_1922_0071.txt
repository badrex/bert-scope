tldr: This study investigates the effect of temperature on the gravitational attraction using a torsion balance. The authors found that the so-called Newtonian Constant of Gravitation remains constant within the temperature range of 0°C to 250°C, which contradicts previous findings. The improved experimental setup and methods of suspension helped to minimize systematic errors and provide more accurate results.
