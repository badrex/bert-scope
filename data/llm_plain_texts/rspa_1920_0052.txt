tldr: The author re-examined the light scattered by gases, focusing on helium and argon, to study their polarization properties. They found that helium's scattered light is almost completely polarized, while argon's scattered light has a more complex polarization behavior. The experiments also revealed the importance of gas purity and the challenges in measuring the weak component of scattered light.
