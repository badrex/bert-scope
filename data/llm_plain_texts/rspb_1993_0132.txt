tldr: The study examines the possibility that copulation calls made by rhesus monkeys are honest signals of male quality. Observations reveal that as competition for oestrous females increases, fewer copulating males make calls. Males who call during copulation are more likely to be attacked by other males, but they also obtain more matings. This suggests that copulation calls may be honest indicators of quality that help females make mate choices.
