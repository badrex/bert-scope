tldr: This study examines the biomechanics and aerodynamics of the Cretaceous pterosaur Pteranodon, focusing on its wing structure, gliding performance, and ecological conditions. The authors reconstruct the wing based on fossil evidence and analyze its strength, aerodynamic efficiency, and ability to soar in various environments. They conclude that Pteranodon was primarily a glider, well-suited for low-speed soaring and gentle landings, and that its extinction may have been due to climatic changes, such as an increase in average wind speed.
