tldr: The author investigates the transformation of rhipidistian paired fins into the primitive tetrapod limb. They propose a new theory that differs from previous hypotheses, suggesting that the proto-tetrapod pectoral and pelvic fins had a similar structure. The author also introduces the terms archepodium and neopodium to describe parts of the tetrapod limb derived from the rhipidistian paddle skeleton and new formations, respectively. This new theory helps explain the relationships of the radiale (tibiale) in various forms and the development of limbs in living tetrapods.
