tldr: This study investigates the drifts and winds in the D and E regions of the ionosphere over Europe, focusing on sporadic E-layer drifts. The authors used closely spaced receiver methods and television signal monitoring to gather data. They found that drift speeds in the E region were more variable than in the D region, and that there was evidence of a semi-diurnal rotating component in the drifts. The study also provided some qualitative indications of the height gradient of drifts, with a higher percentage of east-west components showing a negative height gradient of velocity.
