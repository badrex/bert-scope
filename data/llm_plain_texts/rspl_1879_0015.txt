tldr: Lord Rayleigh's experiments and theories on capillary phenomena of jets explore the behavior of fluids as they flow through orifices of various shapes. He discovered that the wave-length of the figure formed by the jet is directly proportional to the velocity of the fluid, and that the elongation of the wave-length increases with the pressure. This research contributes to the understanding of fluid dynamics and the behavior of jets.
