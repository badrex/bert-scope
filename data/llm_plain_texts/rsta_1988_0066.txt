tldr: This article examines the compositions of chondrites, a type of meteorite, and their potential role in the formation of the solar system. The authors analyze the chemical makeup of nine different groups of chondrites and find that they have solar abundances to within a factor of two. This suggests that chondrites may be the materials from which the inner planets were constructed, providing important insights into the early stages of the solar system's development.
