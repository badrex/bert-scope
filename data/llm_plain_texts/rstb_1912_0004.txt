tldr: The author conducted experiments on nerve anastomosis to restore paralyzed muscles, specifically focusing on facial nerve substitutes. They performed various experiments on dogs and monkeys, exploring different methods of cross-union and the efficiency of different substitute nerves. The results provided insights into the restoration of function after nerve crossing and the potential for practical applications in surgical work.
