tldr: The article discusses the finite deformation of a viscous ellipsoidal inhomogeneity in a matrix undergoing a general linear time-dependent flow at infinity. The authors use the analogy between linear elasticity and slow incompressible viscous flow to develop governing equations for the deformation of the inhomogeneity. They then solve these equations for an inhomogeneity in the form of an elliptic cylinder in a linear two-dimensional flow with steady streamlines. The behavior of the inhomogeneity under pure shear and simple shear is considered, and the patterns of behavior are classified into regimes based on the singularities of the differential equations governing the variations of shape and orientation of the inhomogeneity.
