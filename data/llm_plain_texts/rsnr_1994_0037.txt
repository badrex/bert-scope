tldr: This book review discusses the life and work of Srinivasa Ramanujan, an Indian mathematician who made significant contributions to number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions. Despite facing challenges in England during World War I, Ramanujan collaborated with G. H. Hardy, producing groundbreaking work in the theory of partitions. After returning to India, Ramanujan's health declined, and he passed away at a young age. His notebooks continue to inspire mathematicians today, and his story is a testament to his extraordinary talent and Hardy's support.
