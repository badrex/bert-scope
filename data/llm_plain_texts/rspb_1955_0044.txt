tldr: This article discusses the complex interactions between genes and the environment that affect hybrid vigor in plants. The author examines the phenomenon of heterosis in Lycopersicon, specifically in tomato plants, and explores how gene interactions and environmental factors contribute to the expression of heterotic characters. The author also highlights the importance of understanding these interactions for practical plant breeding and selective processes in nature.
