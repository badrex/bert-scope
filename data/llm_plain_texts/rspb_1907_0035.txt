revised_title: 'The Role of Complement and Sensitizing Substances in Phagocytosis'

tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the nature of the substance in serum that influences phagocytosis. They discovered that the thermostable substances in both normal and immune sera are probably identical and that the sensitizing action of the serum might be due to the combined action of two substances: one thermostable and the other thermolabile. The sudden fall in the "opsonic" power of both normal and immune serum on heating is likely due to the destruction of complement.
