tldr: This article uses paleomagnetic data from the Lhasa, Qiangtang, and Kunlun Terranes of the Tibetan Plateau, along with data from stable Eurasia, eastern China, and Indochina, to test different models of crustal thickening in the Tibetan Plateau. The data suggest that the Lhasa Terrane has moved 2000 + 800 km north with respect to stable Eurasia, indicating strong internal deformation in southern Eurasia since the India-Eurasia collision. The findings challenge the model of large-scale underthrusting of the Indian subcontinent beneath the Tibetan Plateau as the mechanism for crustal thickening in Tibet.
