  - Rolling motion
tldr: The author examines the unique behavior of a toy boat-shaped rigid body that prefers spinning in one direction. They provide a detailed analysis of the rolling motion and the influence of the body's center of mass, inertia, and surface of contact on its spinning behavior. The study reveals that the body's preference for a specific direction of spin is due to the relationship between its principal axes of inertia and the surface of contact.
