tldr: The authors studied the oxidation mechanisms of formaldehyde and formic acid by ions of chromium (VI), vanadium (V), and cobalt (III). They found that both formaldehyde and formic acid are oxidized through processes involving direct C-H bond fission in the rate-determining step. The oxidation mechanisms resemble those for secondary alcohol oxidation, but there are some kinetic differences between the oxidations of these compounds and secondary alcohols like cyclohexanol or isopropanol.
