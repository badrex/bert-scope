tldr: The author investigates the synapsis process in amphibians, specifically in Triton's testes. They discovered that during the synapsis, the chromosomes pair up to form gemini, which then separate during the first meiotic division. This research confirms the general interpretation of the meiotic metamorphosis in amphibians and provides insights into the permanence of chromosomes from one cell generation to another.
