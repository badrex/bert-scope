tldr: The authors investigated the slow combustion of methyl alcohol in a Pyrex vessel, studying the kinetics and analytical results. They found that the reaction exhibits an autocatalytic behavior, with the overall activation energy being 53 and 61 kcal in an old and a new vessel, respectively. The results show that the pressure change is a valid measure of the reaction's extent, and the maximum rate is dependent on the initial partial pressure of methyl alcohol and the oxygen partial pressure.
