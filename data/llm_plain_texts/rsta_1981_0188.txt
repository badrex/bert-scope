tldr: This article reviews recent research on the Norwegian Coastal Current, focusing on its circulation, variability, and dynamics. The variability of the coastal current is mainly caused by meteorological effects and freshwater fluxes. The current not only responds to local wind forcing but also serves as a signal channel for sea-level variations in the North Sea. The variability often manifests as mesoscale waves and eddies. The subsurface frontal region is characterized by the interleaving of coastal and Atlantic water, with strong mixing. The article discusses the influence of wind, fresh water fluxes, and the role of topography in the transport patterns of the Norwegian Coastal Current.
