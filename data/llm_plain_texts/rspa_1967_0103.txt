tldr: The authors conducted an electron distribution study on the covalent bond in diamond using X-ray data and a generalized structure factor. They found that the covalent bond corresponds to a mid-bond peak and revealed two important non-spherical components in the charge densities of bonded atoms. These components are associated with the covalent bond and are responsible for the unique properties of the diamond structure.
