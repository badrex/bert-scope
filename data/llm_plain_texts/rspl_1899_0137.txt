tldr: This article presents a collection of papers read to the Royal Society of London in 1900. The papers discuss monochromatic vision, electrical conductivity in gases traversed by cathode rays, the effects of temperature on bacteria, and the thermo-electric qualities of metals under strain. These papers were communicated by notable scientists such as Professor J. J. Thomson, Professor Ramsay, Lord Lister, and Lord Kelvin.
