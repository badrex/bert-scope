tldr: This paper discusses the observations and analysis of shelf-sea fronts, which are high gradient regions in the ocean that separate well-mixed and stratified zones. The study focuses on the movements and structure of these fronts, their relation to mean circulation, and the impact of tidal mixing and heating on their behavior. The research also explores the complex velocity field observed in these regions, which may be due to large-scale eddies that develop from the instability of the flow.
