tldr: The article discusses the challenges of handling and interpreting multiple results in the health service due to the increased availability of automated equipment and chemical measurements. It highlights the need for data control, efficient data input, and the use of discriminant analysis to extract meaningful information from multiple measurements. The author also raises concerns about the potential negative impact of automation on patient care and suggests that smaller, more accessible automated machines could be a better solution.
