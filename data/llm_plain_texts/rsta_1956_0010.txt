tldr: This paper explores the distribution of stress in an infinite elastic solid when time-dependent body forces act on certain regions of the solid. The authors derive a general solution using four-dimensional Fourier transforms and apply it to various problems, including two-dimensional and axially symmetrical cases. The study is important for understanding stress distribution in soil mechanics, foundation theory, and other branches of applied mathematics.
