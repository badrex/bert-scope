tldr: This article reviews the research on supercooling and rapid growth conditions on the lunar surface, focusing on the crystallization of minerals like olivine, pyroxene, and plagioclase. The authors discuss the limitations of using terrestrial analogues and emphasize the importance of controlled cooling-rate experiments to understand the consolidation of lunar lavas and impact liquids. The findings provide new guidelines for interpreting crystallization on the lunar surface.
