tldr: This article discusses the effect of the geographical distribution of observations on the accuracy of satellite orbits. The authors analyze the orbit of Echo 1 rocket using observations from the Northern and Southern Hemispheres separately and together. They find that using observations from both hemispheres significantly improves the accuracy of the orbit, especially for eccentricity and angular parameters. The study suggests that extending the orbital coverage by increasing the number of observers in the Southern Hemisphere and observing both north- and south-bound transits can improve the accuracy of future orbit determinations.
