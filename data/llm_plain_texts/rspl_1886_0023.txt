revised_title: 'Investigations into the Effect of Surface Condition on Light and Heat Radiation from Incandescent Surfaces'
semantic_tags:
  - Thermodynamics
  - Heat radiation
  - Surface properties
  - Incandescent lamps
  - Carbon filaments
tldr: 'The author conducted experiments with incandescent carbon filaments and discovered that the surface condition of the filaments significantly affects the amount of light and heat they emit. A black surface requires more energy to produce the same amount of light compared to a brighter surface. This finding has implications for the efficiency of incandescent lamps and the design of future lighting technologies.'
