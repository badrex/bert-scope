tldr: The authors present an improved solution for electron correlations in narrow energy bands, taking into account the interactions between electrons and their movement. The new solution predicts a finite lifetime for pseudo-particles and the Mott insulator-conductor transition. The theory is based on an analogy with alloy physics and uses the Green function technique to develop the mathematical details.
