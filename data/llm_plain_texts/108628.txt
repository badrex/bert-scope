tldr: This article by William Henry Barlow explores the element of strength in beams subjected to transverse strain, known as "the resistance of flexure." Barlow experiments with various beam forms and shapes, discovering that the existing theory underestimates the actual tensile strength of the metal. He proposes a new theory that accounts for the resistance due to molecular disturbance accompanying curvature, which helps explain the discrepancies in the previous theory. Barlow's findings contribute to a better understanding of beam behavior under transverse strain and improve the accuracy of structural engineering calculations.
