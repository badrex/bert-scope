tldr: The authors studied the effects of permeant anions and depressant drugs on inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in cholinergic synapses of Aplysia neurons. They found that the decay of IPSCs was affected by the nature of permeating anions and that foreign halides and barbiturates altered the IPSC decay. The results were interpreted in terms of a reaction between the anion and an ion-binding site associated with the anion-selective channel, which affects the probability of anions entering the channel and normal channel closure.
