tldr: The study examines the kinetics of sulphonamide binding to carbonic anhydrase and how the structure of the sulphonamides affects their activity. The researchers found that the increase in binding constant is mainly due to an increase in the association rate constant. They also identified an intermediate non-coordinate complex that forms before the final coordinate complex. This work helps understand the relationship between the structure and activity of sulphonamide inhibitors for carbonic anhydrase.
