tldr: This study investigates kin-biased behavior in termite colonies, specifically in Schedorhinotermes lamanianus, using multilocus DNA fingerprinting. The results show that workers departing from the nest to foraging areas assort according to their kin, suggesting that for polygynous and polyandrous termite colonies, workers show kin-biased foraging behavior.
