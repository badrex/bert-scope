tldr: The article discusses a series of experiments conducted at the Argonne 12-5 GeV proton-synchrotron to study quasi-elastic neutrino interactions. The researchers used iron as the primary target and a spark chamber detector to analyze the interactions. The data collected provided a measure of the momentum transfer dependence or form factor for the axial vector part of the weak interaction, which is expressed in terms of an axial vector mass or a mean square radius for the axial vector interaction. The results from these experiments could help determine the axial vector mass with an accuracy of approximately 20%.
