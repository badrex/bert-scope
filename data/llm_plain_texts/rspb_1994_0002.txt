tldr: This study examines four strategies for deploying transgenic plants to delay insect resistance: pure stands of toxic plants, seed mixtures, refugia, and seed mixtures with refugia. The research finds that seed mixtures of toxic and toxin-free plants can slow down resistance development compared to pure stands of toxic plants. The effectiveness of seed mixtures and refugia depends on assumptions about pest movement, mating, and inheritance of resistance.
