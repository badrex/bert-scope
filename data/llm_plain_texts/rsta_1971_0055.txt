tldr: This article reviews empirical and theoretical models of the solar photosphere and low chromosphere, focusing on the temperature-height profile. The author emphasizes the continuous spectrum observations and analysis, suggesting a minimum electron temperature of 4300 K. The Bilderberg continuum atmosphere serves as a reference model for comparing recent observational and theoretical results.
