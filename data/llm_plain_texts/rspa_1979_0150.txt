tldr: The author proposes a model for the Earth's magnetic field based on the Nernst effect, which involves a flow of heat across a magnetic field in an electrical conductor. This model suggests that the magnetic field near the Earth's surface is due to electric currents flowing deep within the Earth and can explain the repeated reversals of the field. The author argues that this model does not violate Cowling's theorem, which restricts homogeneous dynamos based on fluid motion.
