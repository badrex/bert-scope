tldr: In 1733, Stephen Gray and Granville Wheler observed the solar eclipse using telescopes and a helioscope. They made their observations at Norton-Court and Otterden-Place in Kent. Their observations were made with an instrument consisting of a telescope and a box with a digit scheme at the end. The authors shared their findings with the Royal Society, hoping that the account of their observations would be deemed valuable.
