tldr: 'John Harris observed and documented various types of microscopic organisms in water samples. He discovered four main types of animals in a small drop of rainwater, including oval-shaped creatures, eel-like organisms, and a large maggot-like creature. Harris also found different types of organisms in puddle water, some giving the water its color. He speculated on the possible ways these organisms could be produced and called for further research on the topic.'
