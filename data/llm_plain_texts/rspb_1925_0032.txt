tldr: The authors investigate the intertraction phenomenon, where solutions mix by developing streamers or "pseudopodia" due to a force called "intertraction." They find that this phenomenon is not caused by surface tension or capillary forces, but rather by differences in the rates of diffusion of solutes in the solutions and the direction of gravity. The authors provide explanations for three different cases of the intertraction phenomenon and discuss the molecular significance of these findings.
