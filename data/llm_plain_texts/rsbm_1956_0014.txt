tldr: John William Nicholson was a brilliant mathematician and physicist who made significant contributions to the understanding of atomic theory, spectroscopy, and the study of nebulae. His work on the coronal and nebular spectra led to the prediction of new spectral lines and the development of atomic models that later influenced the work of Bohr and his successors. Nicholson's research on the angular momentum of atoms and the introduction of Planck's constant in atomic models were groundbreaking and helped shape the field of quantum mechanics.
