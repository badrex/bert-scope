tldr: In a 1763 letter, Thomas Dawes, a chaplain in Aleppo, describes the devastating effects of the plague on the city and its inhabitants. The outbreak lasted for six years, causing widespread famine, scarcity, and loss of life. Dawes recounts the multiple times the city was put under confinement due to the plague and the toll it took on the mental and physical health of the residents. He also provides a detailed account of the mortality rate and the impact of the plague on different communities within the city.
