tldr: The authors present initial results from the High Altitude Observatory white light coronagraph on Skylab, focusing on the extremes of temporal scales of coronal variations. They discuss long-term coronal variations, such as the restructuring of the corona with decreased surface activity, and the role of coronal transients in the solar atmosphere. The study of these phenomena helps shed light on the formation and nature of the outer coronal magnetic field during solar minimum periods.
