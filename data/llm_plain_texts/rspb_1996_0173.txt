tldr: 'Male zebra finches preferentially pair with females that have a higher potential for fecundity due to previous exposure to a high-quality diet. This preference is demonstrated through dietary manipulation experiments, showing that females with larger clutch sizes are more likely to secure a mate. This study provides the first evidence linking a female's fecundity to her likelihood of obtaining a mate, highlighting the importance of reproductive potential in mate selection for monogamous species.'
