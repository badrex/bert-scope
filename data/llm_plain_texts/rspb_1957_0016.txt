tldr: The authors conducted experiments using ionophoresis to test the accessibility and behavior of intrinsic and extrinsic acetylcholine receptors at the motor end-plate. They found that both types of receptors are equally accessible to applied drugs and have similar responses, suggesting that there is no basis for differentiating between them.
