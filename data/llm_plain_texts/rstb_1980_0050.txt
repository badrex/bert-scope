tldr: The authors studied the active sites of two extracellular β-lactamases produced by Bacillus cereus. They discovered that one enzyme, β-lactamase I, is inactivated by 6-β-bromopenicillanic acid, with serine-44 being the site of reaction. This serine residue is conserved in other β-lactamases and is considered a good candidate for an active site group in these enzymes. The other enzyme, β-lactamase II, requires metal ions for activity, with three histidine residues and the enzyme's sole thiol group binding the metal ion needed for activity.
