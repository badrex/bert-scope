tldr: The author, Harry Lobb, conducted experiments using a continuous galvanic current to test the sensitivity of the skin on the hand and foot. He discovered that the skin on the back of the hand and wrist is more sensitive than the palm, and there is a line on each finger where sensitivity changes. The same sensitivity patterns were observed on the foot. This research helps to understand how the body perceives touch and pain.
