tldr: The author discovered vegetable parasites in the hard structures of various animals, such as sponges, foraminifera, corals, bivalves, and gastropods. These parasites are unicellular fungi that can dissolve the carbonate of lime in the hard structures they penetrate. The author also found that these parasites can be used to demonstrate the double-refracting power of certain animal shells.
