tldr: 'The article discusses the life and scientific contributions of Heinz London, particularly his work on superconductivity and electrodynamics. London, along with his brother Fritz, developed the London theory of superconductivity, which explained the zero resistance and zero permeability properties of superconductors. Their work also hinted at the possibility of a quantum effect on a macroscopic scale, leading to the prediction of flux quantization.'
