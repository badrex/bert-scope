tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the relationship between blood volume and surface area in both captive and wild animals. They found that blood volume is a function of surface area and developed a formula to calculate it. The study also discussed the importance of understanding deviations from the average blood volume for diagnosing abnormal blood volume in animals.
