tldr: The authors conducted a comparative study of the mesomorphic (liquid crystalline) phases in a surface-active agent/solvent system using optical, density, and X-ray diffraction methods. They investigated the structure and phase transitions of the three common lyotropic mesomorphic phases, confirming previously proposed structures and advancing a new structure for the middle phase. The study provides insights into the fundamental building units and aggregation states of micelles in these phases.
