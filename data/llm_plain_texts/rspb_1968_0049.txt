tldr: 'This study investigates the righting responses and neural control of swimmeret movements in lobsters. The authors found that tilting a lobster triggers bilaterally asymmetrical swimmeret and uropod movements, which help the lobster maintain its balance. These responses are controlled exclusively by the statocyst receptors, which likely involve both position and acceleration receptors. Destroying one statocyst shifts the position of symmetry for the swimmerets and uropods, while either statocyst can control the righting responses of the uropod and swimmerets on either side. The findings suggest that neural models based on the bilaterally reciprocal organization of statocyst influences can explain these responses.'
