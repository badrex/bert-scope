  - Water-Gas Shift Reaction
tldr: The article discusses two examples of catalysis by supported metal clusters, focusing on the hydrogenation of ethylene and the water-gas shift reaction. The authors demonstrate that these reactions involve a molecular cluster frame during the catalytic cycle, highlighting the potential of cluster catalysis in the field of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis.
