tldr: This article presents two papers read to the Royal Society of London. The first paper discusses the presence of a glycolytic enzyme in muscle, while the second paper is a comparative crystallographical study of double selenates of the series R^M^eOJ^GlIoO, where M is magnesium. The author also describes a phenomenon of negative after-images following brief light exposure after a period of darkness.
