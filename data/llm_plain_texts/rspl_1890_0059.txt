tldr: The author develops the subject of ellipsoidal harmonics from their expressions in Cartesian coordinates, investigating harmonics of ellipsoids with three unequal axes, and deducing those of prolate and oblate spheroids as particular cases. The study includes applications in potential theory, magnetism, and electrical capacities of surfaces. The author also demonstrates addition theorems for spheroidal harmonics and their connection with Bessel functions.
