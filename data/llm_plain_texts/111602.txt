tldr: This article investigates the role of the ossicles in the human ear and how they contribute to the conduction of sound to the labyrinth. The author conducts various experiments to determine whether sound can reach the labyrinth without the ossicles and whether the conformation of the ossicles chain affects sound conduction. The results support the idea that the ossicles play a crucial role in hearing, and sound travels through the air in the tympanic cavity to the cochlea and through the ossicles to the vestibule.
