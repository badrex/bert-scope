tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of metastable helium atoms on metal surfaces. They discovered that these atoms can set free large numbers of electrons from the surface, which could have implications for understanding cathode phenomena in arc and glow discharges. The findings suggest that metastable atoms play a significant role in electron emissions.
