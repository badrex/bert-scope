semantic_tags:
  - Vitamin D

  - Antirachitic activity
  - Radiation products
tldr: The authors conducted experiments to distill and separate vitamin D and its irradiation products from ergosterol. They found that the most volatile fraction represents substances originally present in the mixture, while the substance with intense absorption at 290 is formed during distillation. The authors also described a method for the partial separation of irradiation products, obtaining a crystalline product with high antirachitic power.
