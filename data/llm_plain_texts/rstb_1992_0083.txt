tldr: This study demonstrates that bees perceive illusory contours similar to humans and identifies neurons in the dragonfly optic lobe that respond to motion of these illusory contours. These findings suggest that insects, despite their spatially crude and low processing power vision, use similar mechanisms to humans for object segmentation and demarcation.
