tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments to study the properties of rays reflected when a beam of particles strikes an object. They discovered that the reflected radiation can be divided into two types: an easily absorbed radiation and a more penetrating one. The absorption coefficient of the more penetrating radiation decreases with increasing thickness of the reflector. The authors also found that the amount of radiation scattered back by a thin layer is proportional to the intensity of the radiation falling on that layer.'
