tldr: The author investigated the effects of temperature on the modulus of torsional rigidity of quartz fibers, which are commonly used in torsion instruments. They found that the modulus of rigidity increases linearly with temperature, but the temperature coefficient varies among different quartz specimens. The internal friction of the fibers is relatively small and remains constant with temperature. The fibers' rigidity reaches a maximum at around 880Â°C before decreasing rapidly.
