tldr: This article explores the evolution of a rotating liquid mass with a given angular momentum, focusing on the Kelvin-Poincare problem of stellar evolution. The author examines the Maclaurin spheroid, the Jacobian ellipsoid, and binary configurations, discussing their properties and the course of evolution. The study aims to provide a better understanding of the origin of binary stars and the role of the principle of degradation of mechanical energy in the trend of evolution.
