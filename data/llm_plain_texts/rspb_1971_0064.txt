tldr: The authors describe the crystallography and growth of calf rennin (chymosin) crystals. They discuss the methods of increasing crystal size, the role of supersaturation in nucleation, and the effects of different buffer solutions on solubility. The study focuses on the orthorhombic crystal form of calf rennin, which is the only stable crystal form found in this investigation.
