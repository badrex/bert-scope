tldr: This article investigates the behavior of free electrons in ionic crystals under the influence of an external electric field. The author demonstrates that the conventional method of calculating electric current in solids is incorrect and that a stationary state cannot be reached under these conditions. The study also explores the implications of these findings for the theory of dielectric breakdown and the energy distribution of electrons in electric fields.
