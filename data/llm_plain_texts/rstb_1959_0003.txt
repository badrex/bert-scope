tldr: 'This study investigates the Late-glacial deposits at Moss Lake, Liverpool, and reconstructs the vegetational history of the area. The deposits, dating from the Late-glacial period to the Post-glacial thermal maximum, reveal a diverse range of plant species, including several species with disjunct or restricted present-day ranges. The findings provide valuable insights into the history of the British flora, particularly during the Late-glacial and early Post-glacial periods.'
