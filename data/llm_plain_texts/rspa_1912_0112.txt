tldr: The author investigates the hydrolysis of methylic acetate by acids and the factors affecting the reaction rate. They find that the molecular hydrolytic activity decreases with increasing dilution, and that water plays a role as a solvent rather than an active participant in the reaction. The study provides insights into the behavior of different hydrolytes and hydrolysts in solution.
