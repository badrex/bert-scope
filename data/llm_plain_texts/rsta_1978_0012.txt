revised_title: Grain Boundary Sliding and Deformation Mechanisms in Creep of Engineering Materials
semantic_tags:
  - Creep
  - Grain boundary sliding
  - Diffusion creep
  - Dislocation creep
  - Material properties
tldr: This article discusses the mechanisms of grain boundary sliding and deformation in the creep of engineering materials. It explores the different categories of grain boundary sliding, including diffusion creep, rigid grain creep, and dislocation creep, and their effects on stresses and deformation at grain boundaries. The article also examines the stress systems and grain motions resulting from these mechanisms.
