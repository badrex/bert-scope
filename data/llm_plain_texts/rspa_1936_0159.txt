tldr: 'This study investigates the kinetics of the thermal decomposition of benzalazine vapor. The authors heated benzalazine in sealed evacuated bulbs and analyzed the composition of the resulting permanent gas using gas-analysis over mercury. The results provide insights into the reaction mechanism and the decomposition process of benzalazine vapor.'
