tldr: The authors study the behavior of atoms when adsorbed on solid surfaces and how they can change between different states, such as vibrating in one place or migrating to another part of the surface. They develop a formula to calculate the time an atom remains in the adsorbed condition and explore the potential field between the atom and the surface. This research is useful for understanding various chemical phenomena that occur at solid surfaces.
