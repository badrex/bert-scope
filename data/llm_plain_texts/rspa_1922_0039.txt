tldr: The author conducted a study to improve the precision of balance measurements. They discovered a significant source of error in the balance's intermediate joint and made improvements to reduce the residual errors. By using a modified weighing method and minimizing external factors, the author achieved a probable error of one-fiftieth of the possible discrepancy suggested by the balance makers.
