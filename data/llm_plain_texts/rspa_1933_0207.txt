tldr: The authors observed a new band at 3240 in the ammonia spectrum when a trace of nitrogen was present in the discharge tube. They analyzed the band's structure and found it to be a result of an electron transition between and levels. The analysis showed that the band is a rare example of a transition between these levels and provides valuable insights into the molecular structure of ammonia.
