tldr: The article presents a mixed boundary-value problem to describe the axisymmetric coupled motion between an inviscid, compressible fluid and a semi-infinite cylindrical elastic shell. The shell is rigidly bonded to a hollow cylindrical duct, acting as a waveguide for the plane acoustic wave that forces the system. An exact solution is obtained using the Wiener-Hopf technique, focusing on the heavy fluid loading and long waves limit.
