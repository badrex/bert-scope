tldr: This article examines the nature and properties of pus, distinguishing it from other purulent fluids. The author, George Pearson, identifies three essential components of pus: animal oxide, limpid fluid, and spherical particles. He also discusses the differences in pus composition in various diseases and the role of putrefactive fermentation in causing pus to become fetid. The study provides a clearer understanding of pus and how to differentiate it from other substances.
