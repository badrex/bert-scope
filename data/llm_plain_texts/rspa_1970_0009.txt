tldr: This study investigates the heat of adsorption of hydrogen on polycrystalline tungsten wires using a modified wire calorimeter. The authors found a heat of adsorption of 263 at zero coverage and discovered that 20% of sites have a strong adsorption, while the remaining sites behave as a homogeneous set of localized sites. The research also shows the adsorption process's reversibility and the importance of understanding the interactions between gas and metal surfaces.
