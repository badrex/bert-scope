tldr: This study investigates the radiation-induced hydrogen isotope exchange in 1,4-dioxan and its inhibition by various substances. The exchange rate is found to be proportional to the square of the tritium concentration, and the results suggest that two separately scavengeable primary radiolysis products are involved in the reaction sequence. The authors propose a mechanism that occurs in spur regions and explain the main features of the inhibition by electron scavengers and other substances.
