tldr: 'The article discusses an extension of Maxwell's theory of pin-jointed frameworks by M. W. Crofton. It explains the concept of self-strain in frameworks and how certain frameworks can be in a state of stress independently of external forces. The author also provides examples of hexagonal and octagonal frameworks that can be self-strained.'
