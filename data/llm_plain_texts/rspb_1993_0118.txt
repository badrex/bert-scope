tldr: The article describes the detection of two isoforms of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) in human muscle by specific T cells from myasthenia gravis patients. The researchers found that T cells can recognize and distinguish between the two isoforms, which have different insertions in the a-subunit of the AChR. This discovery provides insights into the autoimmune nature of myasthenia gravis and the role of T cells in recognizing and responding to the AChR isoforms.
