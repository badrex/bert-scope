tldr: The study investigates the metabolic responses and survival mechanisms of the fourth stage juveniles of Ditylenchus dipsaci, a type of nematode, during anabiosis. It explores how these organisms can lose almost all of their body water and survive in a desiccated state for extended periods. The research examines the changes in metabolite contents and enzyme levels in anabiotic stages and follows the metabolic changes that occur during rehydration.
