tldr: This paper investigates the motions of electricity in a spherical conductor and the influence of dielectric media on the propagation of electromagnetic effects. The author examines the mathematical character of the problems and introduces a system of formulae that can be applied to various physical questions. The study focuses on the assumptions made in Maxwell's theory of electricity and the effects of these assumptions on the calculations and results.
