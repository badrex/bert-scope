tldr: The author investigates the gyration of light by multiplet lines, focusing on the relationship between the intensities of spectral lines and the effects of magnetic fields. The study uses Kramers' and Heisenberg's dispersion theory and the rotating electron model to analyze the phenomenon and its implications for understanding atomic behavior and the Zeeman effect.
