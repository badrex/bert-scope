tldr: The author, Humphry Davy, conducted experiments on the combustion of diamonds and other carbonaceous substances. Despite previous conjectures about differences in their chemical composition, Davy's experiments showed that diamonds and other carbonaceous substances combine with the same quantity of oxygen and form the same quantity of carbonic acid. His experiments also disproved the hypothesis that hydrogen is a constituent part of diamond, as it is present in other carbonaceous substances.
