tldr: The authors describe a technique to achieve high accuracy in measuring the freezing point of zinc and the boiling point of sulphur using platinum-resistance thermometers. They found that the zinc point is more reproducible than the sulphur point, suggesting that the zinc point could be a better primary fixed point for the International Temperature Scale. The freezing point of zinc was determined to be 419.5055 ± 0.0002 °C.
