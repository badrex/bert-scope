tldr: The authors present an asymptotic approach to analyze crack problems in poroelastic media, focusing on time-dependent stress intensity factors and the interactions between the elastic and fluid responses. They use an alternative formulation to simplify the understanding of the physical processes involved and avoid numerical inversion of Laplace transforms. This method allows for a wide range of loadings to be considered and can be applied to fracture problems in porous rocks and fluid-filled materials.
