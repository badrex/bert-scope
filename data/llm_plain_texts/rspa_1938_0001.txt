tldr: The author investigates seiches, or long waves, in a strait connecting two seas. They develop equations to analyze the wave motions and find that the depth and shape of the strait influence the behavior of the waves. The study helps to understand the complex dynamics of water movement in straits and can be applied to improve predictions of ocean currents and tides.
