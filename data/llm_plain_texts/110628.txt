tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the formation of alkaline and earthy bodies in plants and the role of carbonic acid in their generation. The results showed that the formation of these substances is always preceded by the absorption of carbonic acid, leading to a remarkable compensating provision in nature that regulates the quantity of carbonic acid in the atmosphere and keeps it constant.
