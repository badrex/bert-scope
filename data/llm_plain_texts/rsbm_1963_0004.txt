tldr: Charles Galton Darwin was a British scientist who made significant contributions to the field of X-ray crystallography. He developed the mosaic crystal model, which explained the intensity of X-ray reflexion and diffraction. Darwin's work laid the foundation for understanding the atomic structure of crystals and has been crucial in the field ever since.
