tldr: The author investigates the minor fluctuations in the human body's temperature when at rest and concludes that they mainly result from alterations in the amount of blood exposed to external absorbing and conducting media. The study demonstrates how covering or uncovering the body, or changes in blood flow, can affect the body's temperature and overall heat transfer.
