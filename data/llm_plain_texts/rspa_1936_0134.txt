tldr: The authors present a study on the self-consistent field with exchange effects for negative ions, focusing on the atomic configuration of closed groups. They use Fock's equations to calculate the self-consistent field and analyze the impact of exchange terms on the field. This work provides a basis for other calculations in atomic and molecular physics.
