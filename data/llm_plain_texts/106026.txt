tldr: The author describes the anatomical discovery of a double uterus and vagina in a woman who died during childbirth. The two uteri were connected by a septum, allowing both to be potentially impregnated through either vagina. This rare anatomical structure challenges previous beliefs about the reproductive system and the determination of a fetus's sex.
