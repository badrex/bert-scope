tldr: This study compares the composition, distribution, and abundance of bacteria, fungi, and testate amoebae in the soils of Signy Island in the Antarctic and Moor House in the temperate region. The results show that soil type has a greater influence on the quantity of microorganisms than the climatic zone. The Antarctic soil microflora is more cold-tolerant than the temperate one, suggesting a selection and adaptation process in extreme habitats.
