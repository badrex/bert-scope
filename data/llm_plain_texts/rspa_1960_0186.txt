tldr: The authors studied the oxidation of isobutane catalyzed by hydrogen bromide in a static system between 125 and 250Â°C. They found that the overall process was mainly (CH3)3CH + O2 = (CH3)3COOH, with the rate of oxidation increasing from a small initial value to a maximum and then decreasing. The reaction was accelerated by added bromine, t-butylhydroperoxide, and di-2-butylperoxide, while many alcohols retarded the oxidation. The authors suggested that the main chain carriers in the reaction were bromine atoms and 2-butylperoxy radicals.
