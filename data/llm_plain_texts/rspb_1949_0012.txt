tldr: This article discusses the antibiotic activity of growth factor analogues and their potential use in inhibiting bacterial growth. The author explores the relationship between p-aminobenzoic acid and sulphonamides, which inhibit bacterial growth by competing with essential growth factors. The article also highlights the need for further research on the mechanisms of action and the development of more effective analogues.
