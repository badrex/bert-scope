tldr: The author critiques previous research on extracellular photosynthesis by examining the methods and results of Usher and Priestley. They find that chlorophyll, when exposed to light, produces an aldehyde, presumably formaldehyde, as a decomposition product. However, this does not prove that formaldehyde is a product of photosynthesis or that photosynthesis can occur outside living cells. The author also discusses the presence of a catalase enzyme in plants and its role in preventing the accumulation of hydroxyl.
