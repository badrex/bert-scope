tldr: This article discusses the measurement and analysis of the microwave background radiation's spectrum and anisotropy. The authors found that the radiation has a blackbody spectrum, supporting the hot Big Bang model. The extreme isotropy of the radiation sets limits on models for the formation of mass structures, while the observed dipole anisotropy is mostly due to the Galaxy's peculiar velocity. The article also reviews recent developments in measuring the spectrum and anisotropy, and projects future advancements in the field.
