tldr: The authors conducted a study on the properties of aluminium-zinc alloys and determined a new equilibrium diagram for these alloys. They used thermal and microscopic investigations to understand the composition and behavior of the alloys. The study revealed the formation of new compounds and solid solutions, and provided insights into the solidification and decomposition processes of the alloys.
