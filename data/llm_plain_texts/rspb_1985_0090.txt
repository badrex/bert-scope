tldr: This study examines the feeding strategies of juvenile and adult Biomphalaria glabrata snails under simulated natural conditions. The research finds that these snails primarily consume decaying macrophyte tissue, colonial diatoms, and smaller green algae, with their feeding behavior and mouthparts adapted for this generalist diet. The findings have implications for understanding snail ecology, population control, and the role of snails in aquatic ecosystems.
