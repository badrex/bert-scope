tldr: 'This study investigates the ability of various chemical compounds to induce the formation of neural tissue in amphibians. The authors found that substances like methylcholanthrene, 1:2:5:6-dibenzanthracene, and styryl 430 have the capacity to evoke neural tissue formation, while others like naphthalene and equiline show little to no evocatory power. The results suggest that evocation is not a reaction to an unspecific stimulus and has some relation to oestrogenic and carcinogenic activity but does not run parallel to either of them.'
