tldr: This article investigates the statistical fluctuations in the vibrational energy flow characteristics of two spring-coupled, one-dimensional subsystems. The study focuses on the effects of driving frequency, damping models, and stochastic modeling on the variability of energy flows. The authors propose a non-dimensional parameter to characterize the frequency beyond which simplified theories like Statistical Energy Analysis may not work well. They also explore empirical procedures to predict the 5% and 95% probability points given knowledge of the first two moments of the response.
