tldr: The author shares his experience with new microscopes made in Naples and their use in observing small objects. He also discusses his observations of human blood cells with Father di Tor, confirming the discoveries made in di Tor's book. The microscopes' high magnification capabilities allowed for detailed examination of blood cells, revealing their circular or elliptic shapes and the presence of perforations in some of them.
