tldr: 'This study examines the relationship between female reproductive biology and male ejaculate characteristics in fish. It investigates how sperm length, numbers, and longevity are related to the number of ova, ovum diameter, and the mode of fertilization. The research finds that sperm numbers increase with ova numbers in externally fertilizing species, while sperm length is positively correlated with the number of ova in external fertilizers. The study suggests that female reproductive biology plays a significant role in shaping male investment in ejaculates.'
