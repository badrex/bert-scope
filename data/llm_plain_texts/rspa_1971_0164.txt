tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the decomposition of diethyl peroxide in a cylindrical vessel and studied the effects of diluents on self-heating. They found that self-heating is always present and that the critical temperature rise for ignition is independent of dilution. The results support the conductive theory of thermal explosion, which predicts that temperature gradients at the vessel boundary should be the same in both cylinders and spheres.
