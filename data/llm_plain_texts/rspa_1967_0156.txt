tldr: The authors measured the frequencies of normal modes of vibration in a single crystal of thallous bromide using inelastic neutron scattering techniques. They found that most frequencies are independent of temperature, but some modes display temperature-dependent broadening. Various rigid-ion and shell models were fitted to the results, with a 14-parameter shell model providing a reasonable description of the dispersion curves. The study provides insights into the nature of interionic forces in thallous bromide, an interesting ionic crystal with unique properties.
