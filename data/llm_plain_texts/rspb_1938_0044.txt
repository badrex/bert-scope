tldr: 'This study investigates the relationship between sea-level characteristics and high-altitude acclimatization using statistical methods. The author finds that seven sea-level variables, including pulse rate, pCO2, oxygen capacity, weight, and age, are correlated with acclimatization. A formula is developed to predict acclimatization based on these variables, but the author notes that the formula is arbitrary and some variables may be redundant. The study provides a foundation for understanding individual variations in ability to acclimatize to high altitudes.'
