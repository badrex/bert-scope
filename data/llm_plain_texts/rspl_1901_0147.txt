tldr: The author discusses the migration of potash in soils and the impact of Queen Victoria's reign on the advancement of science. The study found that potash is more migratory than phosphoric acid in subsoils, and some of it may form a stable compound. The Royal Society mourns the death of Queen Victoria, who was a great patron of science, and expresses hope for continued scientific progress under her son, King Edward VII.
