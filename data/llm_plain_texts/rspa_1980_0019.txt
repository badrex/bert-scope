tldr: The authors studied the effect of grain size and temperature on the yield and flow stresses of polycrystalline beryllium. They found that both yield and flow stresses follow the standard relationship with grain size, and the temperature dependence of the yield stress is primarily due to the intragranular resistance to dislocation motion. The flow stress increases progressively with strain, and the authors attribute this to the effect of grain size on the dislocation density at a given strain.
