tldr: This article discusses the evolution and environment of early vascular plants in the late Silurian and early Devonian periods. It focuses on a Gedinnian assemblage from the Welsh Borderland, which is dominated by rhyniopsids and includes species of Cooksonia and Salopella. The study highlights the challenges in recognizing and classifying early vascular plants and suggests that more well-preserved and independently dated assemblages are needed for a better understanding of their history.
