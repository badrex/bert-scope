tldr: This study investigates the ignition behavior of heptane-oxygen-inert gas mixtures at temperatures where ignition occurs through a one-stage mechanism. The authors found that the limiting ignition pressure depends on temperature, reactant mixture composition, and surface factors such as the average distance of molecules from the walls. The results show that the surface parameter that primarily determines the ignition tendency is the average distance of the molecules from the walls, rather than the surface-to-volume ratio. The findings can help test different ignition models for the oxidation of paraffin hydrocarbons.
