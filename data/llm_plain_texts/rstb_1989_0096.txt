tldr: This study examines the diversification and extinction patterns of mammals during the Neogene period in the perimediterranean region. The analysis focuses on rodents, the most successful and diversified mammal order, and provides insights into the dynamics of these communities and the driving forces behind their evolution. The research highlights three main periods of high origination rates and two significant extinction events, with the early Vallesian period experiencing the most important extinction event. The findings suggest that factors such as ice growth in the Southern Hemisphere and faunal migrations may have contributed to these events.
