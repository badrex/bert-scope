tldr: 'This study investigates the role of cholinergic mechanisms in fertilization of Xenopus laevis eggs. The research team found that both eggs and sperm contain acetylcholine (ACh), and that ACh is released from eggs upon exposure to hypotonic solutions. However, they concluded that cholinergic mechanisms are unlikely to be involved in sperm-egg interactions during fertilization.'
