tldr: James Anderson observed the peculiarities of tides between Fairleigh and the North Foreland and explained the supposed meeting of tides near Dungeness. He found that the tides do not meet in a line across the Channel due to the coast's formation and the alteration of the tide's course. The gentle blending of waters results in a strong eddy and a foamy rippling where they meet.
