tldr: The authors present a mathematical model for studying flames, focusing on the equations and boundary conditions required to describe the behavior of reacting gas mixtures. They introduce a one-dimensional flame model and discuss the assumptions and methods used to solve the complex flame equations. The study provides insights into the structure and behavior of flames, with implications for understanding and controlling combustion processes.
