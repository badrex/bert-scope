revised_title: Electromagnetic Surface Wave Scattering by a Conducting Sphere
semantic_tags:
  - Electromagnetic wave theory
  - Wave scattering
  - Conducting sphere
  - Asymptotic expansions
  - Electromagnetic surface waves
tldr: The authors study the scattering of electromagnetic surface waves by a conducting sphere using matched asymptotic expansions. They find reflexion and transmission constants for the finite number of modes, providing a solution to the problem without explicitly constructing the outer solution.
