tldr: The authors analyzed the textural variability of inter-reef sediments in the vicinity of the Howick Group in the Great Barrier Reef. They identified four sediment types and found that three factors are responsible for 94% of the textural variation. The distribution of these sediments displays concentric elliptical patterns around each platform reef, with a size gradient from coarse sand and gravel near the windward reef edge to fine sand near the leeward margin.
