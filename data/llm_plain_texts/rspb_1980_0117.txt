tldr: This article discusses the formation and processing of biologically active peptides, focusing on the role of precursor forms in the synthesis and secretion of hormones and neurosecretory peptides. The authors review the current understanding of precursor forms and their processing mechanisms, emphasizing the peptides of the gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine system. They also explore the evolutionary relationship between brain and gut regulatory peptides and the potential role of limited digestion in cell-cell communication.
