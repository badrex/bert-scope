tldr: A. W. Hofmann researched phosphorus-bases, focusing on triethylphosphine, and its reactions with organic chlorides, bromides, and iodides. He discovered a compound with two different forms of bromine and explored its various transformations and reactions with other elements, such as silver nitrate. This research sheds light on the phosphorus-bases' properties and their potential applications in chemistry.
