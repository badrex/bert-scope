tldr: This article discusses the impact of geochemistry on plant life, focusing on three examples of geochemical systems: serpentine soils, selenium-rich soils, and arsenic-toxic soils. The author explains how these unique environments have influenced plant growth, development, and evolution over millions of years, leading to the emergence of specialized floras and endemics.
