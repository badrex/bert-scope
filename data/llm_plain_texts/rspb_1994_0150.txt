tldr: The authors used optical imaging to study the functional architecture of neurons in owl monkey area MT, a region involved in visual motion processing. They found that area MT has a multidimensional functional organization, including direction and orientation preferences. The results suggest that area MT processes both motion and shape variables, challenging the idea of a purely shape-independent organization in this area.
