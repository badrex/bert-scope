tldr: 'The authors found that seeing structure from global motion in certain kinematograms required a period of learning. However, this learning was not specific to the orientation of the line elements or the direction of global motion. The results suggest that the neural site of deriving form from motion is beyond the level of individual motion and pattern detectors. The learning was transferable across stimulus dimensions, indicating that different neural structures may be involved in learning stereopsis and form from motion.'
