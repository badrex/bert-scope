tldr: This study investigates the effects of visceral and somatic stimuli on neurons in the rat nucleus raphe magnus, which is thought to be involved in the mediation of diffuse noxious inhibitory controls. The researchers found that some neurons in this area can be influenced by both visceral and somatic stimuli, and some of these neurons have spinal projections, suggesting a possible role in the pathway that mediates d.n.i.c.
