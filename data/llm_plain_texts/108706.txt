tldr: The author describes the synthesis and properties of organometallic compounds, specifically stannic ethide and stannic ethylomethide. These compounds are created by replacing the second equivalent of iodine in stannic iodide with ethyl and methyl radicals, respectively. The author discusses their physical properties, such as boiling points, specific gravities, and combustion behavior, as well as their reactions with halogens and other elements.
