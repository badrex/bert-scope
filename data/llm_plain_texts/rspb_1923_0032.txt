revised_title: 'Carbon Balance and Respiratory Quotient in Fat Metabolism of Timothy Grass Bacillus'
semantic_tags:
  - Fat metabolism
  - Carbon balance
  - Respiratory quotient
  - Timothy Grass Bacillus

tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the Timothy Grass Bacillus to study its fat metabolism. They found that the carbon from glucose was distributed among carbon dioxide, the organism's fat, and protein. The respiratory quotient changed as the experiment progressed, indicating a shift in the organism's metabolism. This study provides valuable insights into the physiological economy of the Timothy Grass Bacillus.
