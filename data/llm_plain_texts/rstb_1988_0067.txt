tldr: This article discusses the concept of frequency-dependent selection and its relation to intraspecific competition. It presents various models of competition, including the logistic model and the Lotka-Volterra models, and explains how these models can be used to understand the evolutionary process and population dynamics. The authors also introduce the Poulsen model, which extends previous models by considering density-dependent mortality during development.
