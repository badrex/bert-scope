tldr: The authors conducted a study on the periodic variations of Trypanosoma gambiense and Trypanosoma rhodesiense in rats, guinea-pigs, and rabbits. They found that the parasites exhibited periodic increases and decreases in the peripheral blood of the animals, which could be due to variations in host resistance and the formation of latent, non-flagellate forms of the trypanosomes in the host's internal organs.
