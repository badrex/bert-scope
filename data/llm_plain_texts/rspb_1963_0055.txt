tldr: This study examines the chromosomal configurations and developmental stages of germ cells in human ovaries from early fetal life to shortly after birth. The research found that the total population of germ cells reaches a peak and then declines due to three distinct 'waves' of degeneration affecting germ cells at different stages. The findings provide a better understanding of human ovarian development and germ cell degeneration.
