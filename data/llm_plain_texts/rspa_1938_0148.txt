revised_title: 'Generalized Saha Equation for Non-Equilibrium Ionization Systems'
semantic_tags:
  - Ionization equilibrium
  - Radiation
  - Thermodynamics
  - Degenerate systems
  - Saha equation
tldr: The article explores the ionization equilibrium in systems where radiation and the assembly are not in thermodynamic equilibrium. It extends the Saha equation to include degenerate systems and provides a generalized formula for calculating ionization probabilities. The study is relevant to understanding ionization processes in white dwarfs, planets, and other celestial bodies.
