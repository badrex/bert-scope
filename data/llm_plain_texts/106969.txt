tldr: In 1798, William Herschel discovered four additional satellites of the planet Georgium Sidus (now known as Uranus). He also explained the retrograde motion of its older satellites and the disappearance of satellites at certain distances from the planet. This discovery expanded our understanding of the planetary system and the capabilities of telescopes at the time.
