tldr: The authors studied the behavior of various additives, such as lead tetraethyl, iodine, and ferrocene, in explosions and their effect on antiknock properties. They used kinetic absorption and emission spectroscopy to observe the reactions and found that some additives, like iron and manganese compounds, act as antiknocks by reacting with burnt or burning gases. The results help to understand the mechanism of antiknock action and improve engine performance.
