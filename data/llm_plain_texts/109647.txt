tldr: In 1800, William Herschel observed the newly discovered celestial body by Dr. Olbers and the expected comet. He first saw the new planet Vesta on April 24th but couldn't determine its position due to insufficient motion. He examined Vesta with a 460-power telescope but found no distinguishing features from surrounding stars.
