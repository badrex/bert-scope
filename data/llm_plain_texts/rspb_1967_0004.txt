tldr: 'This study examines the variation in skull characteristics of long-tailed field-mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) from the Channel Islands, comparing them to mainland populations and finding that Channel Island mice are larger but closely related to A. sylvaticus rather than A. flavicollis. The research uses measurements of ten skull characters and multivariate analyses to understand the differences between populations.'
