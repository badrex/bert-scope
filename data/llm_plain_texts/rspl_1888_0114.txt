tldr: This article presents a preliminary study on the effect of light on magnetism using iron bars. The author found that when an iron bar is illuminated, it experiences a magnetic change, which may be due to the direct action of radiation. The study also shows that the magnetic effect is local and confined to the illuminated surface. Further research is needed to understand the relationship between light and magnetism.
