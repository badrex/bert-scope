tldr: The author demonstrates the connection between the theory of electron correlations in narrow energy bands and conventional many-body perturbation theory. The derivation shows how the perturbation series of the narrow energy band theory can be derived from the many-body perturbation series by regrouping and partial summation of terms. This connection allows for a better understanding of the relationship between the two approaches and can be useful for generating related approximations in both theories.
