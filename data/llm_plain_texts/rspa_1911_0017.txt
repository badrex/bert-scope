revised_title: The Charges on Ions in Gases and Their Effects on the Motion of Negative Ions
semantic_tags:
  - Ion charges
  - Gas ionization
  - Electric forces
  - Diffusion
  - Negative ions
tldr: The author investigates the charges on ions in gases and the effects of electric forces on the motion of negative ions. They found that the charges on negative ions in various gases are similar, and the motion of negative ions in dry gases follows different laws compared to positive ions. The study also shows that the velocity of agitation of negative ions is greater than that of particles in thermal equilibrium with the gas molecules.
