tldr: The authors studied a sexually abnormal domestic fowl that laid eggs and had male plumage. They discovered that the bird was a normal hen with an active ovary. The explanation for this phenomenon is that during the moult, the ovary undergoes a process of involution, making it physiologically inactive for a short period. This allows the plumage to grow without the controlling influence of the sex gland, resulting in male-type plumage. The authors suggest that a temporary dysfunction of the ovary (and/or thyroid) at the time of the moult is responsible for this disharmony in plumage characterisation.
