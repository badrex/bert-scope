tldr: The author investigates the effects of highly immunized animal serums on microbes in vitro, particularly focusing on the reactions with cholera vibrio, typhoid bacillus, and other bacteria. The study shows that these serums can cause bacterial aggregation and loss of motility, which can be used for diagnostic purposes. The author also compares the effectiveness of this method with other diagnostic methods, such as Pfeiffer's test, and highlights its advantages.
