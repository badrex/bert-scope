tldr: The authors investigated the disintegration of boron by slow neutrons using an ionization chamber filled with boron trichloride and a linear amplifier. They found evidence for two disintegration energies, with the main reaction releasing about 2.99 MeV and the smaller reaction releasing about 2.75 MeV. The results suggest that the smaller energy release corresponds to the formation of the nucleus in the ground state. The study also detected and measured the quantum energy of the associated beta radiation.
