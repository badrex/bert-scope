tldr: Dr. Wallis shares a letter from Myn Heer Leibnitz about a French author's upcoming treatise on the origins of nations, drawing from ancient mythology. Leibnitz believes that this work may contain valuable discoveries, despite the author's potential partiality towards Gauls or Celts. Wallis communicates this information to Dr. Sloan, Secretary to the Royal Society.
