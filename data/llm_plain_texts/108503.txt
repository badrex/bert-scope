tldr: In this study, the author observed the effect of atmospheric pressure on ocean levels during an arctic expedition. They discovered that changes in atmospheric pressure directly affect the ocean's mean level, which can cause irregularities in tides. The author developed a new method of observation to measure the ocean's mean level and found that it is inversely related to the mean pressure of the atmosphere. This research sheds light on the movements and irregularities of tides in polar regions and along coasts.
