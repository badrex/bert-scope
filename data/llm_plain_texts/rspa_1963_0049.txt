tldr: The author provides a thermodynamical proof of Shoenberg's conjecture that the oscillatory magnetization of a metal exhibiting the de Haas-van Alphen effect can be correctly obtained by substituting the average magnetic field for the local field in the standard expression for magnetization. The author also analyzes the influence of eddy currents induced in the metal by changes in the magnetic field, which cause the observed magnetization to follow a well-defined single-valued curve.
