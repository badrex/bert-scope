tldr: The authors conducted further research on two types of diamonds, exploring their finer infra-red absorption spectrum using a grating and studying the photoelectric effect at lower temperatures. They observed differences in the infra-red absorption and photo-conductivity between the two types of diamonds, and investigated the effects of temperature and moisture on their properties.
