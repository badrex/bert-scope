tldr: 'This study investigates bees' spontaneous preferences for various black-and-white patterns using a multiple-choice test procedure. Bees were trained to randomized checkerboard patterns before testing them with sets of other patterns. The results show that bees prefer patterns containing radiating elements and symmetrical patterns, indicating an innate response to features of natural flowers.'
