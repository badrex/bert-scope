tldr: The author conducted an experiment where they transplanted fertilized ova from an Angora rabbit into the uterus of a Belgian hare rabbit. The resulting offspring included both Angora and Belgian hare rabbits, demonstrating that the uterine environment does not significantly impact the development of offspring. This research contributes to the understanding of crossbreeding and reproductive biology.
