tldr: The authors studied the dislocation distribution in plastically deformed magnesium oxide using etch pitting techniques and transmission electron microscopy. They found that elongated loops of dislocations are a prominent feature in slip bands, and the dislocation structure remains similar in crystals deformed within the temperature range of 80 to 800 'K. The results provide insights into the mechanisms of loop formation and the behavior of dislocations in magnesium oxide.
