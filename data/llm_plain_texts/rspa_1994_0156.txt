semantic_tags:
  - General Relativity
  - Lanczos Potential
  - Weyl Tensor
  - Spinor Analysis
  - Space-Time Metrics
tldr: The authors explore solutions to the Lanczos vacuum wave equation in various space-times, focusing on the Lanczos potential and its relationship with the Weyl tensor. They analyze different space-time metrics, such as the Bondi and Kasner space-times, and use spinor analysis to derive the Weyl-Lanczos relations.
