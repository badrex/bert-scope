tldr: This study examines the non-stationary polymerization of styrene by perchloric acid in methylene chloride, focusing on stage I. The research reveals that even in this initial stage, there is a parallel non-ionic component in the conversion alongside the ionic mechanism. The overall time-scale of stage I is determined primarily by the removal of free ions through the non-ionic mechanism.
