tldr: The author discusses the discharge of electricity through gases and presents the theory of electrolytic convection. This theory explains various phenomena related to gas discharge and offers a better understanding of the behavior of gases when electricity is passed through them. The author also investigates the conditions under which the exchange of ions between the conductor and the gas molecules occurs.
