tldr: The authors conducted a study on the patterns of fluctuating asymmetry in avian feather ornaments and found that they have a larger degree of asymmetry than other morphological traits. This suggests that fluctuating asymmetry in ornaments can reliably reflect male phenotypic quality. The results support the "good genes" models of sexual selection, which argue that female choice benefits from increased offspring viability.
