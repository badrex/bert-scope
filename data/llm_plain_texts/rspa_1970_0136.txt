tldr: The authors conducted a theoretical study on the effects of permanent dipoles and quadrupoles on ion-neutral collision cross-sections. They investigated the angular dependence of the multipole potential and its implications on experimental results. The study found that for linear molecules, large deviations from the cross-sections predicted by a simple Langevin treatment will be visible if the neutral is selected according to its rotational state, but that 'bulk' experiments will only be weakly affected by the presence of angle-dependent terms in the multipole expansion.
