tldr: The authors determined the piezo-electric moduli of ammonium seignette salt, a crystal with three two-fold symmetry axes. They found that the piezo-electric properties of the crystal are associated with pressures and the moments are parallel to specific axes. The study provides insights into the piezo-electric properties of crystals and their applications in various fields.
