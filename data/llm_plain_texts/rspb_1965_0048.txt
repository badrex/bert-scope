tldr: 'The author, B.F. Skinner, discusses the development of the technology of teaching through the experimental analysis of behavior and its applications in education. He explains how teaching machines and programmed instruction can arrange contingencies of reinforcement to expedite learning and highlights the importance of instrumental support for both teachers and researchers. Skinner emphasizes that while these technologies will not eliminate the need for teachers, they can greatly enhance the effectiveness of education.'
