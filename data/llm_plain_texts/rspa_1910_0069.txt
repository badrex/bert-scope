  - Viscosity measurements
tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the temperature variations of the viscosities of gases in the argon group. They used a modified apparatus to work at different temperatures and obtained interesting comparisons of the temperature variations of different gases. The results indicate that temperature variations of about one-third of a degree are detectable, and the collected results are given in a table for further analysis.
