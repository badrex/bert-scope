tldr: 'The author, Francis Roberts, discusses the limitations of determining the distance of fixed stars using the Pythagorean system of the World. He explains that even with advancements in telescopes, the parallax of fixed stars is difficult to measure due to their vast distances. He provides calculations and estimates to illustrate the immense scale of the universe and the time it takes for light to travel from stars to Earth.'
