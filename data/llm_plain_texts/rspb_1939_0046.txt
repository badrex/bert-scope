tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand how individuals judge the elasticity and viscosity of soft materials. They found that people can distinguish small differences in viscosity and compression moduli, but the methods used to measure these properties were different from classical psychophysical methods. The study aimed to compare the subjective judgments of individuals with their objective physical measurements.
