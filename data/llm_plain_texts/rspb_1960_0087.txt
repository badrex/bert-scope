tldr: Researchers studied the histones from different cell types in oxen and found that while they have similar amino-acid compositions, there are differences that suggest they are cell-specific. The study provides evidence that histones from various cells, such as thymus, liver, spleen, and heart, have distinct properties, which could have implications for understanding cellular functions and processes.
