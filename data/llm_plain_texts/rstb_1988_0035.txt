tldr: The article investigates the biogenesis of yeast mitochondria, focusing on the coenzyme QH2-cytochrome c reductase complex. The authors analyze mutations in the complex and study the role of nuclear-encoded proteins in the processing of apocytochrome b mRNA. They also examine the excision of the terminal intervening sequence in the pre-mRNA and the self-splicing reaction, which requires the presence of magnesium ions and GTP.
