tldr: This article discusses the Mazon Creek biota, a diverse collection of plants and animals preserved in sideritic concretions in the Middle Pennsylvanian period. The author highlights the recurrent nature of these fossil assemblages in the context of Pennsylvanian facies cyclicity and presents a predictive model for their occurrence. The Mazon Creek biota, consisting of marine to freshwater animals and a rich assortment of terrestrial flora, is significant for its three-dimensional preservation and early diagenetic concretion formation around fossils.
