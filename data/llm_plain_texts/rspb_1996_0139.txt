tldr: This article investigates receptor isoform specificity in cellular responses to retinoic acid. Researchers created chimeric receptors to study the effects of different receptor isoforms on gene expression. They found that all tested chimeric receptors activated transcription in response to T3, even those lacking an A region. This study highlights the importance of understanding receptor isoforms in cellular responses to retinoic acid.
