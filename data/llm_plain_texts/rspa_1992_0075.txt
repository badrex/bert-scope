tldr: The article investigates the effects of initiator loss by chain transfer in free-radical polymerization using batch operations. It develops expressions to quantify these effects and provides examples to demonstrate their importance. The study shows that initiator loss by chain transfer can affect monomer conversion and the expected molecular mass of the polymer, and it can cause the instantaneous number-average degree of polymerization to pass through a minimum as the initiator concentration increases.
