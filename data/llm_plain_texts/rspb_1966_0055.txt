tldr: The author discusses the concept of bacterial sexuality and the role of the sex factor in bacterial conjugation. They describe the process of conjugation in Escherichia coli, where the sex factor is transferred from male to female bacteria, converting them into males and allowing for the transmission of the sex factor to other females. This process is infectious and efficient, and the sex factor can be transferred between different bacterial species, making it a unique and fascinating aspect of bacterial behavior.
