tldr: This study investigates people with slightly abnormal color vision who would not be identified as color-blind by standard tests. The author conducted a statistical analysis to determine if normal color vision gradually turns into color-blindness or if color-blind individuals form a distinct group. The research involved using a color perception spectrometer to analyze the color vision of 79 observers, providing insights into the nature of color vision and its potential connection to the Young-Helmholtz theory.
