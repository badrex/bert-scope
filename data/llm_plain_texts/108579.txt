tldr: The author examines the effect of local attraction on the plumb-line at stations on the English arc of the Meridian between Dunnose and Burleigh Moor. They calculate the deflection of the plumb-line caused by local attraction and discuss the importance of correcting the astronomical amplitudes of measured subdivisions of the arc to determine the ellipticity of the Earth more accurately. The author also suggests that further research on local attraction at the stations of the arc is necessary for more accurate calculations in the problem of the Earth's figure.
