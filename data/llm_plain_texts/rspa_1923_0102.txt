tldr: The author investigates the tracks of X-rays and beta-rays using a cloud chamber, discovering the number and distribution of ions along the path of a particle. The study confirms the theory introduced by Sir J.J. Thomson and developed by Bohr and others, providing insights into the ionization and energy loss of particles.
