tldr: The author proposes that the gaseous product of phosphorus reacting with atmospheric air, which has electro-positive properties, is composed of vaporized phosphorus combined with phosphatic acid. The other gaseous product, with electro-negative properties, is identified as ozone, which is also produced during the electrolysis of water. This connection between phosphorus and ozone production is based on their similar odors.
