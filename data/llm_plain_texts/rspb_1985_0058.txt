tldr: The authors studied the presynaptic features of 234 motor endings in cat muscle spindles and found three distinct forms with significantly different characteristics. They also examined the postsynaptic features of 27 motor endings and found that the degree of indentation of the intrafusal muscle fibers by motor axon terminals increases with distance from the primary ending, regardless of muscle fiber type. This research provides a better understanding of the classification and function of motor endings in mammalian muscle spindles.
