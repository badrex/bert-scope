tldr: This article examines the seismicity and structure of the Kopet Dagh region, located east of the Caspian Sea and including Northeast Iran and southern Soviet Turkmenia. The author reviews the regional tectonics and studies the seismicity over the last 100 years, focusing on four major earthquakes. The overall seismotectonics of the Kopet Dagh are interpreted in terms of an eastern 'NNW trend' and a western 'NNE trend,' with active surface structures consistent with a tectonic model based on a NNE motion of Iran with respect to the Turan Plate.
