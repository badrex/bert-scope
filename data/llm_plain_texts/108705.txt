tldr: The author explores the concept of five-pointic contact and its relation to conic sections in plane curves. They establish a theory for the general case of any order curve and provide equations for conics of four and five-pointic contact. This work expands on previous research by PLOCKER, STEINER, and SALMON, and contributes to the understanding of geometric properties of curves and conics.
