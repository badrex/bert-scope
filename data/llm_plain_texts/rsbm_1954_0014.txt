tldr: James Herbert Orton was a prominent marine biologist who made significant contributions to the understanding of mollusk biology, ciliary feeding mechanisms, and growth in marine invertebrates. He discovered that the slipper limpet, Crepidula, was a protandrous hermaphrodite and studied the feeding mechanisms of various marine animals, including gastropods, lamellibranchs, polychaetes, and brachiopods. Orton also conducted extensive research on the growth and development of marine invertebrates, establishing methods for determining their age and breeding patterns.
