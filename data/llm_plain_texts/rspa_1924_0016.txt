tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the ratio of specific heats (cp/cv) of nitrogen and oxygen by allowing the gases to expand adiabatically and measuring the fall in temperature. They used a large expansion vessel and a bolometer to accurately measure the temperature changes. The results showed that the ratio of specific heats for nitrogen and oxygen were 1.4 and 1.33, respectively.
