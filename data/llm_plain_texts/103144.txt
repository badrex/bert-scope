tldr: In 1710, Mr. W. Cheselden, a surgeon, discovered a set of human bones of extraordinary size near St. Albans in Hertfordshire. The bones, which were found near a Roman camp, belonged to a person who would have been eight feet tall if all parts were proportional. This discovery provides insight into ancient human anatomy and Roman history.
