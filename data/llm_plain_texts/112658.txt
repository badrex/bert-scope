tldr: The author proposes a modification to Mr. Merrifield's method for calculating the statical stability of a ship. Instead of using a conic to represent the metacentric involute, Rankine suggests using the involute of the involute of a circle. This simplification allows for a more accurate calculation of a ship's moment of stability at any given angle of inclination.
