tldr: The author investigates the time-constant of accommodation in nerve through excitation by exponentially increasing currents. They measure the time it takes for the nerve's threshold to return to its resting level after being excited by these currents. The experiments are conducted on frog, fish, crab, and human nerves, and the results provide insights into the process of accommodation in nerve cells.
