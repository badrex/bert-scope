tldr: The authors investigated the stress-strain characteristics of two types of lattice planes in polycrystalline iron under tension. They found that the lattice ceased to conform with Hooke's law when external plastic deformation occurred, with different behaviors for the (211) and (310) spacing. The residual strain after removing stress was attributed to the onset of internal stresses due to plastic flow, with the difference in strain for different types of planes resulting from varying internal stress magnitudes in grains of different crystallographic orientations.
