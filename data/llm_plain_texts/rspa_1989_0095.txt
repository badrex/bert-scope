tldr: 'This article analyzes the sound and structural vibrations produced by a large-eddy break-up device (LEBU) in turbulent flow over a flexible wall. The LEBU reduces skin friction in the boundary layer, but can also generate significant acoustic and structural noise. The study models the wall as a thin, flexible plate and focuses on underwater applications where the fluid loading is large. The article provides expressions for the frequency spectrum of the radiated sound and the power fed into the flexural wall motions by the LEBU, and discusses numerical predictions for turbulent flow over a steel plate in water.'
