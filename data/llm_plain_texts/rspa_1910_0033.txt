tldr: This article investigates the photographic action of alpha particles emitted from radioactive substances, specifically focusing on the relationship between the density of the film and the number of alpha particles incident upon it. The author finds that the photographic action of alpha particles can be measured by the photometric density of the film after development, and that the density remains constant for a range of alpha particle velocities.
