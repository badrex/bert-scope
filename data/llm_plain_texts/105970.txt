tldr: The author, T. Lane, invents an Electrometer, a device that measures the amount of electric fluid in a coated phial, allowing for more precise electrical experiments. The Electrometer works by regulating the distance between two brass balls, which determines the quantity of electric fluid and the resulting explosion. The device can be used to study various phenomena, such as the effects of lightning and the conductivity of different materials.
