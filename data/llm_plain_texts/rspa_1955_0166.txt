tldr: The authors extend the theory of fluid instability in a heated layer subject to Coriolis forces. They determine the critical Rayleigh number for the onset of thermal instability and provide numerical results for the case of mercury. The study helps in understanding the behavior of fluids in rotating systems, such as the Earth's atmosphere, and can be useful for predicting weather patterns and ocean currents.
