tldr: The article presents a perturbation theory for Sturm-Liouville problems with interior singularities. The authors construct self-adjoint and -sectorial extensions for three different problems and establish norm resolvent convergence of approximating sequences of operators with smooth potentials. They also discuss various qualitative and quantitative properties of their spectra, comparing them with the one-dimensional Coulomb problem.
