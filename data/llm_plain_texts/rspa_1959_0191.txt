tldr: The authors introduce the concept of generalized product functions and density matrices in many-electron quantum mechanics. They discuss the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian between these functions and explain how to calculate energy expressions in terms of electron density and pair functions. The authors also introduce reduced density matrices and spinless density matrices, providing a clear physical interpretation of these concepts. This work applies to the theory of intermolecular forces and many-electron systems.
