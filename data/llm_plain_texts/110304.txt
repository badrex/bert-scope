tldr: Kerigan presents a method for determining longitude by using the moon's right ascension as an element. This method is an extension of his previous work and can be applied at sea or on land. With the help of a chronometer showing approximate mean time at Greenwich, the longitude of a given place can be determined with a high level of accuracy and practical convenience.
