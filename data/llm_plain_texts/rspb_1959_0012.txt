tldr: This study investigates the immunological status and longevity of radiation-chimaeras, animals that recover from radiation syndrome by receiving intravenous injections of myeloid tissue. The authors found that homologous chimaeras, where the host and donor are from different inbred strains, have a shorter life expectancy due to an immunological reaction between the host and donated tissue. The research explores various aspects of this reaction and identifies some combinations of host and donor that result in longer survival rates.
