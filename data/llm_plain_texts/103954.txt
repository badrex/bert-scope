tldr: M. Dufay's letters discuss the effectiveness of oil of olives in treating viper bites. Experiments in Paris showed inconsistent results, with some animals recovering and others dying despite treatment. Dufay suggests that the difference in success may be due to varying venom potency and bite severity. Further experiments are planned to determine the remedy's applicability in France.
