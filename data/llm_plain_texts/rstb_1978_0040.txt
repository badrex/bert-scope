tldr: 'This study demonstrates that somatic nuclei injected into amphibian oocytes can express their genes in a selective and biologically meaningful way. The oocyte cytoplasm reprograms the injected nuclei to conform to the oocyte pattern of gene expression, providing a valuable experimental system for understanding eukaryotic transcription.'
