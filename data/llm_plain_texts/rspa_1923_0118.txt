tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the refractive indices of benzene and cyclohexane, two substances with different chemical structures. They used a hollow prism and a fluorescent eyepiece to take accurate readings of refractive indices over a wide range of wavelengths. The results showed that benzene has a higher dispersion and more complex optical properties than cyclohexane, which has a simple and low dispersion. This study aimed to analyze the forms of dispersion curves and classify them based on their refractive and dispersive powers.
