tldr: The authors conducted experiments using a thin gas target to study the cross-section and angular distribution of D-D reactions below 50 keV. They used a proportional counter to detect the emitted particles and found that the total cross-section for the two reactions is the same within 1%, but the angular distributions of the products are significantly different. This research is important for understanding nuclear reactions and the potential applications in nuclear energy.
