tldr: The authors studied the fine structure and innervation of the lantern retractor muscle in Echinus esculentus. They found that the muscle fibers are attached to the calcareous pyramid structures through a diffuse connective tissue. The lantern musculature is surrounded by a compartment of the water vascular system, and the limiting layer is a thin sheet of ciliated cubical epithelium. The muscle fibers contain many short myofilaments arranged longitudinally, and each muscle cell is innervated by a single neuron at the proximal end. The attachment area of the muscles contains numerous nerve fibers that can be traced to the origin of the muscle fibers and into the base of the muscle.
