tldr: The author conducted experiments on Myriapoda and insects to study the reproduction of lost parts. They discovered that some insects can regenerate lost limbs, even after undergoing metamorphosis. The author found that the power of regeneration resides in the whole of the organized tissues, and that new limbs develop from the injured surface. This research established that limb regeneration occurs in both metabolic and ametabolic articulata.
