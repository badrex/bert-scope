tldr: The authors conducted research into the physical properties of rare earth metals and their compounds, focusing on molecular heat and molecular volume. They discovered that the molecular heat and volume of water in combination with rare earth metal sulphates is significantly reduced, reaching a minimum value previously unknown. This study also provided important insights into the composition and valence of beryllium.
