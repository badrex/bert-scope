tldr: The author investigates the state of water in muscle and blood, focusing on the osmotic behavior of muscle. They propose a method to determine the amount of "free" water in muscle and blood by comparing the depression of vapor pressure caused by adding soluble substances to the solution. The results show that mammalian blood contains about the same relative amount of water as amphibian muscle, with 80 grams of water per 100 grams of blood.
