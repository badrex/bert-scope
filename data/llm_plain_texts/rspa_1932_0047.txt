tldr: The authors investigated the crystal structure of benzene using X-ray diffraction and found that the benzene molecule has a flat-ring shape. The results suggest that the carbon atoms in the benzene ring have a larger diameter than in graphite and hexamethylbenzene. Further experiments are planned to determine the finer details of the structure.
