tldr: The author applies wave mechanics to a complicated collision problem, demonstrating how the correct result arises naturally from the consideration of waves alone. This study aims to gain a clearer understanding of the relationship between particle-like and wave-like properties of matter, and to explore the potential of the quantum theory in explaining various physical phenomena.
