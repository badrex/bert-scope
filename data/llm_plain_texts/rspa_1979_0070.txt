tldr: The article investigates the microfracture and stress field behavior in brittle solids, particularly focusing on the scratching process. Observations of microcracking around scratches in various brittle materials, such as sapphire and glasses, are presented. The study uses a fracture mechanics approach to analyze the stress field and predict the extent of subsurface microcracking. The findings have implications for understanding abrasive wear rates and the residual strength of scratched materials.
