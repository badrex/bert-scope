revised_title: Thermoluminescence in n-Heptane: Glow Peaks and Trapping Mechanisms
semantic_tags:
  - Thermoluminescence

  - Electron trapping
  - Luminescence centers
  - n-Heptane
tldr: This study investigates the thermoluminescence properties of n-heptane, a crystalline solid, and identifies four glow peaks. The authors propose a blocking mechanism for the traps and suggest that the traps are likely different types of cavities within the solid. They compare their findings with previous results for squalane, an amorphous hydrocarbon, and discuss the implications of their research for understanding thermoluminescence in partially crystalline and amorphous materials.
