tldr: The authors analyze the acoustic radiation from rectangular panels coupled in an L shape, providing analytic expressions for the radiation resistance at high modal numbers. They consider two semi-infinite plates and finite plates, examining the effects of different boundary conditions and the flow of vibrational energy between the subsystems. The results can be used to improve understanding of sound transmission and energy flow in complex structures.
