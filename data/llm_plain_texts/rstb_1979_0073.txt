tldr: This article discusses alternative hypotheses on the behavior and control of migrant pests, specifically Desert Locusts. The authors debate the importance of gregarization and the role of low-density populations in the formation of plagues. They emphasize the need for continuous monitoring and control strategies to prevent the formation of large gregarious populations. The practical implications of these hypotheses have significant consequences for regional and international control organizations.
