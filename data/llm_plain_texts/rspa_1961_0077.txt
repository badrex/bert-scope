tldr: This article investigates the anharmonic contribution to the static dielectric constant in ionic crystals. The authors show that this contribution can be calculated above the Debye temperature if the derivatives of the dielectric constant with respect to temperature and pressure are known. For three alkali halides, the anharmonic contribution is found to be a few parts per cent of the total lattice contribution.
