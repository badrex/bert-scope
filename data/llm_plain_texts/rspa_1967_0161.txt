tldr: The authors conducted a comprehensive study on the pyrolysis of propylene using high-speed gas chromatography. They identified 26 products and proposed a free radical mechanism for the decomposition process. The study aimed to clarify the product distribution and the nature of radical reactions occurring in propylene pyrolysis to better understand olefinic decomposition and the inhibition of paraffin pyrolyses.
