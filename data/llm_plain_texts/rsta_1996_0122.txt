tldr: This article discusses the advancements in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and its ability to provide spatially resolved information for semiconductor devices and materials. The authors describe the XPS method, its history, and improvements in sensitivity that have led to the development of spatially resolved XPS. They also outline various methods for imaging and selected area analysis in XPS, focusing on those that are commercially available or viable for use with large-scale devices like synchrotron soft X-ray sources. The article highlights the role of XPS in three-dimensional analysis of semiconductor devices and materials, emphasizing its unique ability to provide chemical information that is difficult to extract from other surface microanalytical techniques like Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS).
