tldr: The author discusses the limitations of existing map projections and proposes a new method for constructing geographic maps that accurately represents distances and angles. This method involves using conical projections and logarithmic spirals for rumb-lines, making the maps suitable for navigation as well. The author provides an example of constructing a map of a zone between 10° and 60° north latitude and demonstrates its properties and accuracy.
