tldr: The authors discuss the characteristics, occurrence, and origins of oceanic basalts, which make up a significant portion of the oceanic crust. They analyze the unique composition of oceanic tholeiites and compare them to other types of basalts. The authors also explore the possible origins of these basalts, including partial melts of peridotitic mantle and the role of volatile fluids in their formation.
