tldr: Researchers used a technique called DNA fingerprinting to differentiate between aphid clones. They extracted DNA from individual aphids and used a probe derived from human minisatellite regions to create complex multi-locus DNA fingerprints. This allowed them to distinguish between clones of the peach-potato and grain aphid, even when they were indistinguishable using other markers like allozyme electrophoresis. This technique can be valuable for monitoring the genetic variation and dynamics of clonal animals in the wild.
