tldr: The authors present a new approach to calculate the thermal inelastic scattering cross-section of slow neutrons in polycrystalline solids. They use a formalism that simplifies the calculation of the transition probability and provides a simple proof of the Debye-Waller factor. The study derives general expressions for both incoherent and coherent cross-sections and examines the coherent cross-section in detail. Numerical results for various materials are discussed and compared with experimental data, showing satisfactory agreement.
