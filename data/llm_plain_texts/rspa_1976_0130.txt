tldr: The article discusses the fluid flow dynamics in a curved pipe, focusing on the influence of curvature on pipe flow. The study assumes large Reynolds numbers and small curvature, and examines the motion of the fluid in the pipe, considering the effects of centrifugal forces and boundary layers. The findings show that the core flow remains undisturbed until the bend, after which it streams uniformly towards the outside of the curve, inducing a three-dimensional boundary layer.
