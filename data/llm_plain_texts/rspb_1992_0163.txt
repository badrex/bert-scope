tldr: The authors used the baculovirus expression system to produce human GABAa receptor subunits oq and Px in Sf9 cells. They found that a combination of both subunits is required to form detectable GABA-activated chloride channels. These channels were blocked by bicuculline and potentiated by pentobarbitone. The study highlights the importance of subunit interactions in the formation of functional GABAa receptors.
