revised_title: A New Scheme of Classification for the Elements
semantic_tags:
  - Periodic Law
  - Element classification
  - Atomic weight
  - Chemical elements
  - Homologous elements
tldr: The author proposes a new scheme of classification for the elements based on the Periodic Law and the concept of homologous elements. The scheme maintains elements belonging to the same family in appropriate columns, considering the uncertainty of many atomic weights. The author suggests that elements with intense activity, like argon, may be discovered in positions 3, 4, and 18. The scheme reveals groups or series of related elements, with progression only occurring in the highest term of each group. The author believes that this new classification will lead to further appreciation of the relationships among the elements and provide possibilities for future research.
