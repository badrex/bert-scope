tldr: This article discusses the dynamics of galaxies and the presence of dark matter in their outer parts. Observations and theory suggest that dark matter is bound to galaxies and is present around both spiral and elliptical galaxies. The author reviews the evidence for dark matter in the outer parts of galaxies and discusses the distribution of dark matter in the Local Group and elliptical galaxies. The article also explores the implications of dark matter for the dynamics of galaxies and the overall mass distribution in the Universe.
