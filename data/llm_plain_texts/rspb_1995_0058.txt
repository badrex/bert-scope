tldr: The authors demonstrate how ant colonies can solve complex foraging problems using simple algorithms and self-organization. They show that ants can choose a foraging site out of many without any global knowledge or comparative judgments by individual ants. The study explores the effects of various factors, such as the influence of each ant on nestmates, the frequency of ants leaving the nest, and colony size on the foraging strategy.
