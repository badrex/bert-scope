tldr: This study investigates the functions of the cerebellum through various experiments on animals. The research aims to understand whether each half of the cerebellum can function independently, how impulses pass through the organ, the nature of impaired movement after removing parts of the cerebellum, and the relationship between the cerebellum and the cerebral hemisphere. The study concludes that one half of the cerebellum does not rely heavily on the other half for its functions, and that three factors contribute to the defective movements caused by ablation: incoordination, rigidity, and motor paresis. The study also suggests that one half of the cerebellum controls the opposite cerebral hemisphere and spinal cord.
