tldr: This article presents a rapid method for determining the coefficient of any given symmetric function in the plethysm of two S-functions. The method is simple to apply to both small and large values of the partitions involved. The results obtained can be used to express the plethysm as a sum of irreducible symmetric functions, which has applications in various areas of mathematics and physics.
