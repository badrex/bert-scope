tldr: 'Astronomers J. Bevis and James Short conducted various observations of the Moon, Venus, and Mars in London. They also developed a new type of micrometer instrument for precise measurements of celestial objects. This micrometer allowed for accurate measurements of angles and distances without the need for screws or wires, making it easier to use both indoors and outdoors.'
