tldr: 'Charles Wheatstone discovered that an electro-magnet can become a powerful magnet by the gradually augmenting currents it generates itself. This phenomenon occurs when the electro-magnet's residual magnetism interacts with the currents produced by a rotating armature. The resulting increase in magnetic power can be further enhanced by using a cross wire to divert a portion of the current, reducing the resistance and improving the overall effect.'
