tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the refractive indices of various elements, including mercury, phosphorus, and sulfur. They found that twelve out of fourteen elements tested followed the rule of having refractivities in the ratios of small integers within their chemical groups. The authors also observed a connection between refractivity and valency, with refractivity increasing as valency increases.
