tldr: The authors conducted experiments on thick, clean S-N-S sandwiches to study supercurrents and the proximity effect. They found that the critical supercurrent density is subject to random variation but can be described by a semi-empirical expression. The results provide evidence that the process is controlled by a temperature-dependent coherence length. The authors observed supercurrents in lead-copper and tin-copper sandwiches but not in the lead-gold system. The findings may be due to the growth of intermetallic compounds at the interfaces.
