tldr: The author, William Ritchie, conducted experiments to understand the relationship between the conducting powers of wires for electricity and the heat developed in metallic and liquid conductors. He found that the conducting powers are not solely dependent on the length of the wire and that the heat developed is proportional to the square of the current intensity. Ritchie also discovered that the formula of Ohm is only an approximation for feeble currents and that the deflecting forces of magnetic needles are not directly proportional to the force of the current.
