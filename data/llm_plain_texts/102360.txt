tldr: In his letter, Stephen Gray describes his experiments with water lenses and the development of a natural reflecting microscope. He explains how drops of water can form plano-convex lenses and shares a method to create a natural reflecting microscope using a small brass ring and quicksilver. He also discusses the potential for using water lenses in telescopes and microscopes, and his ongoing work on creating large concave specula for burning glasses.
