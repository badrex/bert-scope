tldr: The author analyzes Clausius's formula for the change of state from liquid to gas and compares it with observations on alcohol made by Ramsay and Young. The formula connects the volume, pressure, and temperature of a substance and is useful for calculating the relation between liquid and gaseous states. The author finds that the formula is remarkably accurate, but it does not apply accurately to the case of alcohol due to the lack of constant values for some variables.
