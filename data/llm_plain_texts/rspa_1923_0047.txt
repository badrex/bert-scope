tldr: The author introduces the concept of multenions and differential invariants to develop a new approach to electromagnetic field theory. They apply this method to Maxwell's equations, showing how the principles of relativity are incorporated into the theory. The author also discusses the connection between electromagnetic fields and matter in bulk, emphasizing the importance of considering the extensive and subextensive significance of various quantities in the theory.
