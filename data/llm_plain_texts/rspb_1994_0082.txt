revised_summary: 'This study investigates the effects of ecological factors and intervention on the population size and demography of Serengeti wild dogs, an endangered canid species, between 1965 and 1991. The research found that variations in ecological factors explained most changes in demography but did not account for the decline in adult longevity. A significant reduction in pack life and individual longevity coincided with the introduction of routine intervention, suggesting pathogen-induced mortality. The study highlights the importance of evaluating the impact of research methods and designing effective conservation strategies for endangered species.'
