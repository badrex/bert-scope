tldr: The authors conducted a study to accurately measure the wavelengths of hydrogen lines using a 10-foot concave grating. They aimed to test Balmer's formula and improve the precision of the measurements. The study found that the hydrogen spectrum is unique and useful for checking the accuracy of other spectral lines. The authors also discussed the conditions and techniques used in their experiment, such as using a continuous flow of hydrogen gas and employing tertiary standard wave-lengths for better accuracy.
