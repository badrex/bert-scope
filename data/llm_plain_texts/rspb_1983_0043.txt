tldr: The authors conducted experiments to identify the presence of actin in diatoms, specifically in their locomotion. They used fluorescence microscopy and NBD-phallacidin to bind to the actin filaments, confirming their presence in the microfilamentous bundles. The findings suggest that these bundles may play a role in generating force for cell movement or in the transport of polysaccharide-containing vesicles to specific secretory sites along the raphe.
