tldr: 'This study analyzed the distribution of soil and litter arthropods on Aldabra Atoll, finding that their distribution is largely independent of vegetation type. The research used various methods, including Renkonen's index of similarity, reciprocal averaging, and rarefaction, to understand the patterns in arthropod distribution and characterize different vegetation types. The findings suggest that the lack of clear association between vegetation type and fauna may be due to niche expansion by immigrant species.'
