tldr: The author examines the bile of invertebrates and discovers a chlorophyll pigment called enterochlorophyll, which is present in the bile of Mollusca, some Arthropoda, and the enteric appendages of Echinodermata. The author compares enterochlorophyll to plant chlorophyll and concludes that they are identical based on their similar spectra and reactions to reagents.
