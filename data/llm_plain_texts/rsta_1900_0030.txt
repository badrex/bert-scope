tldr: The authors developed an experimental method using a thin film of liquid to accurately map out magnetic lines of induction in two-dimensional problems. This method was applied to various practical problems, such as the magnetic field around a dynamo or alternator armature and magnetic shielding cases. The results showed good agreement with theoretical calculations.
