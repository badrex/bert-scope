revised_title: Hyperfunctions and Asymptotic Symmetries in Physics
semantic_tags:
  - Hyperfunctions

  - Complex Analysis
tldr: The authors discuss hyperfunctions and their relevance to asymptotic symmetries in physics. They argue that the category of hyperfunctions is more appropriate for discussing solutions of partial differential equations in physics and is a unifying notion for various complexification ideas in the field.
