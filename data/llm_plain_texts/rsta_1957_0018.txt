tldr: The authors study the statistical properties of a random, moving surface in the case of isotropy. They analyze the energy spectrum, moments, and distribution of surface elevation and gradient. They also discuss the distribution of zeros, maxima, and minima, as well as the average length of contours per unit area. The findings are particularly relevant to the analysis of sea waves.
