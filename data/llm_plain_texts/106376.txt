tldr: This article explores the possible method by which Cardan's rules for resolving cubic equations were discovered. It suggests that the inventor, Scipio Ferreus, likely tried various methods to simplify cubic equations and eventually stumbled upon the substitutions that led to Cardan's rules. The article also discusses the limitations of these rules and their application in specific cases.
