tldr: This study examines dendro-dendritic and reciprocal synapses in the primate motor cortex using electron microscopy. The researchers found that these synapses have a typical structure, with presynaptic and postsynaptic membrane specializations and synaptic vesicles in the presynaptic process. They also discovered that presynaptic dendrites receive a high density of synapses, both asymmetric and symmetrical, and that dendro-dendritic synapses are less common than afferent synapses. The findings contribute to our understanding of the complex synaptic organization in the primate motor cortex.
