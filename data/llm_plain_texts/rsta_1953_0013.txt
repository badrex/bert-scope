tldr: The authors develop a general theory of plane strain for large elastic deformations in incompressible materials. They use complex co-ordinates and a method of successive approximation to obtain solutions for various problems, including flexure, shear, and deformation of cylindrical tubes. The theory is applied to infinite bodies containing circular holes or rigid inclusions under uniform tension at infinity.
