tldr: This study investigates the action and contractions of excised mammalian hearts. The researchers found that spontaneous ventricular contractions can continue after heart excision, and the length of contractions is significantly longer than normal. The heart's excitability and power of spontaneous contraction can be regained even after being frozen. The study also shows that in an excited contraction, not all parts of the heart act simultaneously, and the direction of the electrical current does not follow a specific rule.
