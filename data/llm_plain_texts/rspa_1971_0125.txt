tldr: The authors investigated the temperature dependence of electrical resistance in superconducting-normal (S-N) interfaces using a Clarke 'Slug' in mixed systems. They found that the resistance rises as the transition temperature is approached from below, and the main effect takes place above the energy gap. The resistance rise is attributed to the penetration of excitations above the gap from the normal metal into the superconductor and vice versa. The transport equation for the excitations is solved for a simplified one-dimensional model, and the solution demands a potential step at the boundary, which is the mechanism of the observed additional resistance.
