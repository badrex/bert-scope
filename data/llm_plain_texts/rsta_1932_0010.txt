tldr: This article investigates the movements and auto-ignitions of flames in gaseous explosions, focusing on the role of shock waves and their impact on flame velocities and combustion. The authors use high-speed photography to capture and analyze the behavior of flames in various experimental conditions, providing insights into the complex processes of detonation and explosion.
