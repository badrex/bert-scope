tldr: The author conducted observations at the Observatory of Trinity College, Dublin, to determine the obliquity of the ecliptic and the maximum of the aberration of light. They found that the recent publication of Mr. Bessel's work on Dr. Bradley's observations provided a more accurate determination of the obliquity of the ecliptic. The author also discussed the uncertainty of refraction and the importance of paying attention to observations at the winter solstice. The maximum of the aberration of light was found to be 20' 80, which is much greater than expected.
