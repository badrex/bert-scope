tldr: The article discusses the early days of gamma-ray astronomy using the atmospheric Cherenkov technique. It explains how the technique works by detecting the Cherenkov light produced by charged particles in extensive air showers initiated by high-energy gamma rays. The author highlights the unique advantages of this method, such as being ground-based, directional, and relatively simple and inexpensive compared to satellite experiments. The article also touches upon the history, development, and potential of the atmospheric Cherenkov technique in the field of gamma-ray astronomy.
