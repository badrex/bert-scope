tldr: The authors propose a model for the establishment of topographical mappings in neural networks through self-organization. They suggest that the distance between cells is encoded in the system using neural excitation and inhibition, and modifiable synapses. The model, based on neural activity, can be applied to various systems, such as the retino-tectal projection in lower vertebrates, and can help explain how patterned neural connections are set up during ontogenesis.
