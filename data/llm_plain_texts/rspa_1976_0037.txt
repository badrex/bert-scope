tldr: The study investigates the effect of a time-varying collision frequency on radio waves obliquely incident on the lower ionosphere. The research uses the Booker quartic equation to analyze the modulation transferred to the wanted wave and how it depends on height, angle of incidence, azimuth, and radio frequency. The findings show that an increase in the average power of the disturbing wave does not necessarily imply a corresponding increase in the modulation transferred to the wanted wave, and that there can be a marked difference in the modulation transferred to two ordinary or extraordinary wanted waves with the same angle of incidence.
