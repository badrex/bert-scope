tldr: The article discusses the potential use of 4-hydroxyanisole in the treatment of malignant melanoma. The compound is oxidized by tyrosinase, generating reactive orthoquinones with cytotoxic potential. These cytotoxic compounds may damage melanocytes, leading to the death of cancer cells. The author suggests that this mechanism could be a promising approach to the specific chemotherapy of malignant melanoma.
