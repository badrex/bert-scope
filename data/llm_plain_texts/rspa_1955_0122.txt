tldr: This article describes the experimental characteristics of the Birmingham proton synchrotron, a machine that accelerates high-energy protons. It discusses the dimensions and intensity of the circulating beam, the methods to control its impact on internal targets, and the effects of the magnet's field on the paths of secondary charged particles. The synchrotron's operation, stability, and energy distribution are also analyzed, providing insights into its potential for various experiments in nuclear physics.
