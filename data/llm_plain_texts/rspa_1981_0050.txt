tldr: This article presents a fluid-dynamical formulation to follow the secular evolution of a model star with an arbitrary amount of angular momentum. The novel feature of this formulation is the introduction and systematic use of material functions, which facilitate the treatment of the free boundary of the star and enable the use of circulation as a priori constants of motion. The equations of secular evolution are well adapted to studying bifurcation from families of compressible ellipsoids and can be applied to various contexts, including the case of axisymmetric rotating stars.
