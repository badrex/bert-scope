tldr: The author, John Tyndall, conducted experiments on the invisible radiation of electric light using a linear thermo-electric pile and a rock-salt prism. He discovered that the heat intensity of the spectrum increased suddenly beyond the red end, creating a peak he called "calorescence." Invisible rays were found to have various effects, such as igniting materials and causing incandescence in thin metal plates. This research expanded our understanding of the properties and effects of invisible radiation.
