tldr: The author argues that the evolution of sterile worker castes in social insects is driven by the advantage of assured fitness returns. Workers have access to young of various ages, which can be quickly brought to the age of independence, providing a more moderate advantage over solitary foundresses. This model offers a selective pressure for the evolution of worker behavior that is at least as strong as haplodiploidy, without the requirements of high worker-brood genetic relatedness and the ability to manipulate brood sex ratios.
