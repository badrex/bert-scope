tldr: The article investigates laminar flow in symmetrical channels with slightly curved walls, focusing on the Jeffery-Hamel solutions for flow between plane walls. The author presents an approach to derive an asymptotic series solution for a class of channels with nearly straight walls, leading to unique solutions in a limited domain of physical parameters. The resulting velocity profiles include parabolic ones and profiles with a single region of flow reversal at each wall.
