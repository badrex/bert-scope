  - Contractility
tldr: T. Wharton Jones studied the veins of the bat's wing and discovered that they have valves and are endowed with rhythmical contractility. However, in the bat's ears, the veins are not furnished with valves and do not have rhythmical contractility, resulting in a uniform flow of blood.
