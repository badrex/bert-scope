tldr: The author argues that the use of anthropomorphic language in scientific explanations can lead to misleading interpretations and pseudo-theories. She provides examples from recent biological research, such as the work of Dawkins and Hurst, where the language of conflict and selfishness has replaced the objective descriptions of natural selection. The author emphasizes the importance of maintaining scientific purity by avoiding anthropomorphic language and promoting clear, objective descriptions of biological phenomena.
