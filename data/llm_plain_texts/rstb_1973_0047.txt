tldr: This study examines the hereditary blood factors of the Kurds of Iran, focusing on the incidence of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. Blood samples were collected from 184 Kurds living in northwest Iran, and tests were conducted for various blood group systems, plasma proteins, and red cell enzymes. The gene frequencies showed a general resemblance to neighboring populations, but the Kurdish Jews had a much higher incidence of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. The possible reasons for this difference are discussed, including the relationship between the deficiency and resistance to malarial infection.
