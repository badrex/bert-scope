tldr: The article discusses the crystal structure of i-erythritol and its relationship to derived d, l, and racemic substances. The study examines the crystal structure of 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-erythritol, a fluoro-substituted derivative, and predicts the structures of other fluoro-derivatives based on the assumption that hydrogen bonds will continue to determine the arrangement of the molecules. The findings have implications for sugar chemistry and the understanding of crystal structures.
