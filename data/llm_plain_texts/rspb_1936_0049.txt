tldr: 'This article discusses photoelectric measurements of daylight luminous efficiency by comparing the values obtained with a stable photoelectric cell to simultaneous measurements of total radiation using a thermopile. The authors found that the radiation from a clear blue sky generally has a higher luminous efficiency than sunlight. They also investigated the use of a green gelatine filter to reduce the response of the Weston selenium cell to better align with the human eye's sensitivity.'
