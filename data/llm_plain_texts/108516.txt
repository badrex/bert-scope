tldr: The author examines the factors that influence chemical affinity and elective attraction, discussing the work of previous chemists and conducting experiments with iron salts and potassium sulfocyanide. The results show that the amount of a compound formed depends on the nature of the substances involved and the conditions of the reaction, challenging the idea of complete decomposition in chemical reactions.
