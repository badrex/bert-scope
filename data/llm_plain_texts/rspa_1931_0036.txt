tldr: The authors study the diurnal tide in an ocean bounded by two meridians, using a method that involves solving the general dynamical equations with specific boundary conditions. They find that the amplitudes of the diurnal tide are smaller than those of the semi-diurnal tide, and there are periods when neither high nor low tide occurs at any point in the ocean. The results show a close agreement with observations and provide insights into the behavior of diurnal tides in oceans.
