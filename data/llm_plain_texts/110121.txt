tldr: The author, Henry Hennell, studied the interaction between sulphuric acid and alcohol, leading to the discovery of a new compound. He found that when mixed with alcohol, a portion of the sulphuric acid combines with hydrocarbon, forming a new salt. This salt, called the "oil of wine," has unique properties and can be separated from the original mixture. Hennell's research sheds light on the composition and properties of these resulting compounds, expanding our understanding of acid-base reactions and organic chemistry.
