tldr: The authors conducted experiments to test Mott's theory on the scattering of slow alpha particles by helium. They found that the scattering intensity was double the classical value, and the oscillations of intensity with varying angle were more marked and closer together at lower velocities. The results supported Mott's theory and provided insights into the behavior of particles with identical properties.
