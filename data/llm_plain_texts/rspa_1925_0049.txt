tldr: The authors investigate the relationship between the structure of molecules and their optical anisotropy. They examine the scattering of light in gases and the influence of the nature and arrangement of atoms in molecules. The study focuses on hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide, and the results provide insight into molecular structure and optical properties.
