tldr: This article presents complementary upper and lower bounds for second-order perturbation energies in quantum mechanics. The upper bound is equivalent to Hylleraas' bound, while the new lower bound reduces to Prager and Hirschfelder's bound when a specific constraint is applied. The authors demonstrate the theory with a simple example of a perturbed harmonic oscillator.
