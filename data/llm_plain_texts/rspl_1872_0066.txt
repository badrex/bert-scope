tldr: The author discusses the calculation of the numerical value of π and compares different methods for approximating it. They present new calculations for π to 709 decimals and discuss the merits of various methods, including Van Ceulen's and Hutton's formulas. The author finds that Machin's formula, used in this study, is the best method for extensive computation discovered so far.
