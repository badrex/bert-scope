tldr: The authors conducted a spectrographic analysis of 125 children's livers and 14 fetal livers to study the metallic content during intra-uterine life and childhood. They found that iron, copper, and manganese were present in measurable amounts, with variations in content based on age and factors like diet and disease. The study highlights the importance of understanding the mineral content of healthy tissues for accurate analysis and comparison.
