tldr: The author, Charles Lord Viscount Mahon, presents a new and effective method to secure buildings against fire. The method involves under-flooring, extra-lathing, and inter-securing techniques that can be applied to different types of buildings. These methods use a combination of laths, plaster, and sand to create a fire-resistant barrier between the floor, walls, and ceiling, preventing the spread of fire and protecting the building.
