tldr: The authors develop a Green function method to study electronic surface states and interfaces. They clarify the foundations of the method and provide a general formalism for obtaining the desired information, such as the density of states and wavefunction matching at the interface. The method can be applied to various physical situations and does not require assumptions about the abrupt termination of potentials at a geometrical plane.
