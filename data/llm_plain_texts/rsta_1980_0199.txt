tldr: The authors analyzed metal and phosphide phases in Luna 24 soil fragments using microprobe techniques. They found that most metal particles were in the 10 pm size range and had compositions in the low Ni-low Co range. No high Co metal particles were encountered. The study provides insights into the composition of lunar soil and its potential relation to meteoritic materials.
