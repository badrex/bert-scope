revised_title: 'Reevaluating Late Silurian and Early Devonian Palaeogeography through Biogeography'
semantic_tags:
  - Palaeogeography
  - Biogeography
  - Silurian
  - Devonian
  - Earth Expansion Theory
tldr: The author critiques and rejects previous palaeogeographic maps for the late Silurian and early Devonian, arguing that they are biogeographically untenable. They suggest that an expanding Earth model may better explain the available data, and encourage a thorough reconsideration of palaeomagnetic data in light of this theory.
