tldr: The authors developed a method to determine the size of particles in smokes by filtering a measured volume of smoke through an asbestos filter and measuring the increase in weight on a microbalance. This allowed them to calculate the average mass per particle at different stages of the smoke's life. The method was applied to various types of dispersoids, including zinc oxide, and provided insights into the growth and size of particles in smokes.
