tldr: 'The article discusses the unique structure and function of the compound eyes of mantis shrimps, specifically focusing on the color pigments and their role in polychromatic vision. The stomatopod eye has three distinct regions, and the six rows of ommatidia in the mid-band are the main subject of study. The eye contains brightly colored intrarhabdomal filters, lateral filters, and a photoreceptor tiering system. These adaptations allow the mantis shrimp to sample a broad spectrum of light by receptors with narrowly tuned sensitivities, suggesting the possibility of color vision.'
