tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the amount of luminous and non-luminous radiation emitted by a gas flame. They used a thermopile and a galvanometer to detect the radiation and compared the results with different materials, such as water and alum solutions. The study aimed to understand the properties of gas flames and their heat radiation.
