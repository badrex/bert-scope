tldr: 'The article discusses the formation of the Analytical Society in the early 19th century, which played a significant role in introducing continental mathematical ideas into the Cambridge curriculum. The society was founded by John Herschel, George Peacock, and Charles Babbage, who were instrumental in bringing about the necessary changes. Their efforts led to the election of Babbage as Lucasian Professor in 1827, marking the reformers' success in modernizing the Cambridge curriculum.'
