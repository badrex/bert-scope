tldr: The author, A. W. Williamson, describes the synthesis of phosphite of ethyl and amyle, as well as their properties and reactions. The phosphite of ethyl is formed by reacting absolute alcohol with PCl3, while the phosphite of amyle is made from amylate of soda and PC13. Both compounds are soluble in water, alcohol, and ether, and have different boiling points and decomposition behaviors.
