tldr: The article discusses the production of motor fuels and chemicals from coal using the Sasol Synthol process, which is based on the Fischer-Tropsch reaction. The process involves passing hydrogen and carbon monoxide over iron catalysts at high temperatures and pressures. The fixed-bed system produces heavy hydrocarbons, while the fluid-bed system generates light motor fuels and oxygenates. The resulting products can be used as raw materials for various industries, including the petrochemical, paper, textile, and food industries.
