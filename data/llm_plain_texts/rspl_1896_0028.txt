tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the freezing points of alloys containing silver or copper with another metal. They found that the temperature of the mixture in the tube only altered by a small margin due to changes in external or circulating liquid temperature. This research contributes to understanding the composition and properties of metallic carbides.
