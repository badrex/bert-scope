tldr: In this research, Michael Faraday explores the magnetic actions of various substances and their classification into two categories: magnetics and diamagnetics. He discovers that all matter is affected by magnetic forces, and these forces can be stronger than gravity. Faraday also explains the differences between magnetic and diamagnetic actions, as well as the effects of heat on magnetic materials.
