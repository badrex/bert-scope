tldr: The authors studied the erythema response of human skin to ultraviolet light and found that it is due to photochemical decomposition of proteins in the stratum mucosum by the light transmitted through the stratum corneum. They calculated the wavelength of maximum erythemal efficiency and discussed the relationship between erythemogenesis, pigmentation, and carcinogenesis by ultraviolet radiation.
