tldr: This article discusses the concept of parity non-conservation and its implications in particle physics. The author highlights the importance of understanding the behavior of weak interactions and the potential violation of time-reversal invariance. The article also touches upon the CPT theorem and the need for further research to explore the fundamental reasons behind the observed phenomena.
