tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effects of X-rays on the eggs of Calliphora erythrocephala. They found that the sensitivity of the eggs to X-rays changes during development, with the eggs becoming more sensitive after 2.5 hours of incubation. The study provides insights into the factors that determine the differences in cell sensitivity to the lethal action of X-rays.
