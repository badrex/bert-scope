tldr: The authors developed a method to accurately measure the krypton and xenon content in atmospheric air using distillation and low-temperature gas-chromatography for isolation. They used radioactive tracers and gas-chromatographic separation on cooled charcoal to control the separation process. The krypton content of dry air was found to be 1.139 ± 0.01 x 10^-6 by volume, and the xenon content was 0.086 ± 0.001 x 10^-6 by volume.
