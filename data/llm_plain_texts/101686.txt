tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the effects of vacuum on the preservation of various fruits, vegetables, and other food items. They found that some items, like strawberries and cherries, could be preserved in a vacuum for an extended period without spoiling, while others, like meat and bread, would spoil faster in a vacuum. This research could have implications for natural philosophy and the potential development of new preservation methods.
