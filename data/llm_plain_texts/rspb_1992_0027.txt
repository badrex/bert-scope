tldr: The authors propose that the evolution of sexes in organisms with cytoplasmic fusion is driven by the need to minimize conflict between cytoplasmic genes during gamete fusion. They suggest that binary sexes have evolved multiple times in association with fusion, and that species with more than two sexes may have uniparental inheritance of cytoplasmic genes. This new definition of sexes, based on the control of cytoplasmic gene inheritance, helps explain the variety of mating systems observed in nature.
