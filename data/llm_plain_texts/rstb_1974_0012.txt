tldr: The article discusses the electron microscopy and composition of biological membranes, specifically erythrocyte membranes. The authors study the distribution of molecular components and the structural changes that occur when phospholipids are hydrolyzed, leading to the formation of membrane-attached droplets. They use techniques like electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction to analyze the changes in the membrane's thickness and electron-density distribution. This information helps to understand the molecular organization and distribution within the membrane.
