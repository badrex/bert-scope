revised_title: 'Proteolytic Enzyme Activity in Drosera Plants'
semantic_tags:
  - Plant enzymes
  - Proteolysis
  - Carnivorous plants
  - Digestive enzymes
  - Drosera
tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine if carnivorous plants, specifically Drosera, produce proteolytic enzymes to digest proteins. They found that Drosera plants do produce proteolytic enzymes, which break down proteins into peptones. The enzymes are not in the form of zymogens and do not extend the digestion process beyond peptones. The plants can absorb the peptone solution, but do not appear to have bacteria or other microorganisms involved in the digestive process.
