tldr: The author conducted a chemical analysis of the Makariwa meteorite found in New Zealand in 1886. The meteorite's mineral composition includes olivine, enstatite, and chromite, with a high proportion of nickel in the alloy. The analysis reveals similarities with other meteorites like Montrejeau and Borkut, indicating a close relationship between these celestial objects.
