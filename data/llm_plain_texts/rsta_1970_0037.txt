tldr: This article discusses the structure and evolution of the Red Sea and the relationship between tectonics and magmatology in the northern Danakil Depression, Ethiopia. The authors investigate the geology of the area, focusing on the tectonic relations between the Danakil Depression and the African Rift System, as well as the extensive and largely unknown volcanism of the region. They analyze various volcanic units and their petrological and geochemical data, concluding that the sialic crust is missing beneath the northern part of the Danakil Depression, except below the two en echelon elongated volcanic ranges.
