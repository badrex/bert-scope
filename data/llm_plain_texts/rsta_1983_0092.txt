revised_title: The Mystery of the Cosmological Constant
semantic_tags:
  - Cosmology

  - Supersymmetry
  - Phase Transition
tldr: The author discusses the cosmological constant, a quantity in physics that is most accurately measured to be zero. They explore the history of the cosmological constant and its role in the understanding of the universe's expansion. The author also examines the implications of quantum mechanics and the possibility of a phase transition to a foam-like state that could explain the smallness of the cosmological constant.
