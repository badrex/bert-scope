tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the energy of different types of particles emitted by radioactive substances using radium. They attempted to overcome the limitation of maintaining high potential in vacuo by using the active material itself, but faced difficulties in insulation. The experiments provided insights into the discharge potential at very low pressures and the nature of the discharge.
