tldr: The authors study the electromagnetic field radiated by an electric dipole source in a cold, homogeneous magnetoplasma. They explore the dependence of the radiated field and its Pointing vector on direction and frequency, and discuss three types of signal enhancement: enhancement for directions close to the magnetic field direction, resonance cones, and Storey cones. The paper also covers the effects of crossover frequencies in plasmas with multiple positive ion species.
