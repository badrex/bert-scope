tldr: The authors conducted a systematic crystallographic inquiry on benzene derivatives to discover relationships between molecular structure and crystalline form. They tested the Barlow-Pope theory, which connects crystalline form with internal molecular structure, and found that it could explain the observed crystallographic measurements in terms of chemical considerations. The study also provided insights into the activation of nonelectrolytes and changes in the solvent during the process of chemical change in solution.
