tldr: This article describes an experiment to determine the velocity of sound using a chronograph and telegraph wires. The authors measured the time it took for sound to travel between a gun and two observers at different distances. They found the velocity of sound to be 1090.6 feet per second and discussed the impact of personal equations and atmospheric conditions on their results.
