tldr: This article discusses the theories and mechanisms behind biological pattern formation in higher organisms. It explores the concept of morphogenetic fields, which are spatial distributions of physical parameters that guide cell responses and create visible patterns and forms during development. The article also explains the role of molecular interactions and movements in pattern formation, as well as the conditions necessary for pattern formation based on autocatalysis and lateral inhibition in two-component systems.
