tldr: This study examines the physical and chemical changes in insect cuticle during the formation of the puparium in cyclorrhaphous flies. The larval cuticle contains about 60% chitin, while the puparium has 47%. The hardening and darkening of the puparium occur without growth and are independent of the contraction process. The results provide insights into the transformation of the insect cuticle and its significance in the insect phylum.
