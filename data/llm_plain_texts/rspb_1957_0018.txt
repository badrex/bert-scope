tldr: The authors studied the interactions between different choline derivatives and acetylcholine at the motor end-plate. They discovered that choline potentiates the depolarizing effect of acetylcholine, while decamethonium has a 'diphasic' action, initially depressing the acetylcholine effect followed by more prolonged potentiation. The results suggest that the first step in a depolarizing end-plate reaction is the formation of an intermediate, inactive compound between the drug and the receptor.
