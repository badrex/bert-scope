tldr: The author, Fr. Hauksbee, conducted experiments on the ascent of water between two glass planes in a hyperbolic curve. He observed that when the glass planes were placed vertically, the water formed curves that met in the middle. These experiments were performed both in air and in a vacuum, showing that the medium had no effect on the phenomenon. This study contributed to the understanding of fluid mechanics and surface tension.
