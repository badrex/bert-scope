tldr: The author investigates the conjugate classes of the cubic surface group using an orthogonal representation. They partition the group into sets based on geometrical properties and discuss the methods used to identify the 25 conjugate classes. The study provides insights into the structure of the cubic surface group and may point to similar partitionings of other orthogonal and unitary groups.
