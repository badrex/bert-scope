tldr: This article investigates the stability of a viscous fluid flowing between rotating cylinders when they rotate in opposite directions. The author develops a mathematical model and uses asymptotic expansions to analyze the problem, finding the critical velocities and spacings of vortices. The results are compared with experimental data, showing good agreement.
