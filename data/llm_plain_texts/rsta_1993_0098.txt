revised_title: 'Self-Assembly and Organization in Liquid Crystals: Lyotropic Colloidal and Macromolecular Liquid Crystals'

  - Self-Assembly
tldr: The authors review the theory of the isotropic-nematic phase transition for solutions of thin hard rods and semi-flexible chain molecules, along with extensions to polydisperse systems and soft interactions. They discuss the occurrence of more highly ordered liquid crystal phases (smectic, columnar) in concentrated solutions of colloids and macromolecules. Experimental results for various uncharged and charged colloids and macromolecules are compared to theoretical results.
