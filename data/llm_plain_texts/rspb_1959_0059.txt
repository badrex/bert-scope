tldr: The authors studied the anatomy and innervation of the basalar muscle in lamellicorn beetles, focusing on its unique properties and adaptations for flight and control adjustments. They described the muscle's structure, preparation for physiological experiments, and its innervation by different nerve fibers, allowing for graded action and facilitating muscle potentials. The basalar muscle's properties are well-suited for its role in providing power for flight and making control adjustments.
