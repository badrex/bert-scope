tldr: The authors conducted a study on the gaseous oxidation of 2-methyl-but-2-ene and found that the main mode of initial attack in the oxidation process is the direct addition of oxygen to the double bond. The reaction produces various peroxides, and the main non-peroxidic products are acetone, acetaldehyde, and methyl isopropyl ketone. The results suggest that the predominant mode of initial attack is addition of oxygen to the double bond followed by decomposition of the resulting cyclic peroxides, although some hydroperoxylation also occurs.
