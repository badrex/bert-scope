tldr: The authors present a theoretical study of the electronic structure and magnetic properties of uranyl and neptunyl ions. They explain the paramagnetism of uranyl and discuss the energy levels, absorption spectrum, paramagnetic resonance, and susceptibility of neptunyl. The evidence points to -electrons being responsible for the magnetism in these ions.
