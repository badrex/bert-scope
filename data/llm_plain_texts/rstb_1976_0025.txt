tldr: This article discusses the factors influencing root permeability in plants and the challenges in understanding water flow through root systems. The authors explore various methods to determine root permeability and the role of environmental factors and internal plant rhythms in affecting it. They emphasize the need to identify the main resistance to water flow in plants to improve our understanding of water movement in plants.
