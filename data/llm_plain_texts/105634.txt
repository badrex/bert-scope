tldr: The author, Matthew Raper, defends the authenticity of Richard Norwood's measure of a degree and challenges the claim that Sir Isaac Newton had never heard of it in 1666. Raper provides historical context and evidence, such as Norwood's book, "The Seaman's Practice," and its publication history, to support his argument. He also addresses the misconception that Newton endorsed a sixty-mile measure of a degree, clarifying that Newton used the common account among seamen due to his absence from his books during the plague.
