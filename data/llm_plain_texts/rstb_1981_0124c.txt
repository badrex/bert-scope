tldr: This article discusses alternative chemical agents for controlling plant diseases, focusing on compounds that do not directly inhibit fungal growth but instead target the disease itself. These alternative agents can act against the pathogenic processes of fungi or alter the host plant to make it unsuitable for fungal growth. Examples of such compounds include diisopropyl fluorophosphate, acrolein, and tricyclazole. The author suggests that this approach offers potential advantages in terms of selectivity and systemic properties, making it a promising strategy for future disease control.
