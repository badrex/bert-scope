tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the velocities of alpha particles from radium C, thorium C, and C. They used magnetic deflection to measure the velocities and found that the values for thorium and C were lower than previously thought. The results showed that the velocities of alpha particles from these substances were lower than expected, which could not be explained by the Geiger relation.
