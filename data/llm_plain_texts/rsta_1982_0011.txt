tldr: The author investigates the formation of bubbles by breaking wind-waves in deep water and their role in air-sea gas exchange. They find that clouds of bubbles can significantly affect gas transfer between the air and sea, especially at low wind speeds when water is close to being saturated. The study provides insights into the complex interactions between wind, waves, and gas exchange in the ocean.
