tldr: 'The authors successfully isolate and identify the causative agent of infectious ectromelia, a disease affecting mice. They demonstrate the presence of minute retractile particles in both inclusion-bodies and extracts from organs with no visible inclusion-bodies. Using advanced microscopy techniques, they obtain photographic images of these particles, providing evidence that they represent a new type of microorganism. This discovery marks a significant advancement in understanding infectious ectromelia and the nature of viruses.'
