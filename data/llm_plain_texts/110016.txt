tldr: The author, John Davy, conducted experiments on corrosive sublimate and its reactions with various substances. He found that the dry salt does not decompose when exposed to light and discussed its solubility, reactions with other chemicals, and the formation of new compounds. He also observed the effects of corrosive sublimate on muriates of baryta, magnesia, potash, and soda.
