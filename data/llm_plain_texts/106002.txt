tldr: Samuel Holland, the Astronomer Royal, made astronomical observations to determine the longitude of several places in North America. He used a 12-foot refracting telescope and an astronomical quadrant to observe the satellites of Jupiter. Holland also recorded the variation of the compass at different locations, which was crucial for navigation in that era.
