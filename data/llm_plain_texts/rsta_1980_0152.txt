revised_title: Climatology of the Stratosphere and Mesosphere: A Review of Atmospheric Temperature and Wind Patterns
semantic_tags:
  - Stratospheric Climatology
  - Mesospheric Climatology
  - Atmospheric Temperature
  - Atmospheric Wind Patterns
  - Planetary Waves
tldr: This article examines the climatology of the stratosphere and mesosphere using radiosonde, rocketsonde, and satellite data. It describes the seasonal variation of temperature in these layers, focusing on longitudinal and hemispheric differences. The study highlights the role of planetary waves in the general circulation of the stratosphere during winter and the impact of solar heating on temperature differences between the hemispheres. The article also discusses the transition from winter to summer circulation and the influence of the quasi-biennial oscillation on wind patterns.
