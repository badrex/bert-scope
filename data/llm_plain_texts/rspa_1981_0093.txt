tldr: The authors discovered the crystal structures of three isomorphous trimesic acid channel inclusion complexes of polyhalide ions, which are a second example of triple catenation in the solid state. The complexes have the same trimesic acid framework, consisting of two mutually-perpendicular infinite hexagonal planar networks of hydrogen-bonded trimesic acid molecules. The arrangement leaves channels of square cross-section containing linear polyhalide ions.
