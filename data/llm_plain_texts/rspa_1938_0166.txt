tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the scattering and pair production of fast particles by mercury nuclei. They observed a higher frequency of inelastic collisions and pair production than predicted by theory. The results showed a significant discrepancy between the experimental data and Mott's theory for elastic scattering. The authors also investigated the possibility of mercury isotopes being involved in the process.
