tldr: This article examines the role of displacement thickness fluctuations in hydroacoustics and their connection to the jet-drive mechanism of the flue organ pipe. The author reconsiders Liepmann's proposal for calculating aerodynamic sound generated by a turbulent boundary layer and applies the theory to the interaction of a mean flow with wall cavities, slots in aerofoils, and leading and trailing edges of splitter plates. The study challenges the currently accepted explanation of organ pipe operation and provides a new perspective on the exchange of energy between a mean flow and an acoustic field.
