tldr: The article describes a convergent synthesis method for prostaglandins using organometallic chemistry. The method involves the use of chiral building blocks and a three-component coupling process to create the prostaglandin framework. This approach allows for the efficient synthesis of various naturally occurring prostaglandins, including prostacyclin, and offers a controlled synthesis of isocarbacyclin.
