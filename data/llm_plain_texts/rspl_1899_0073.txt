tldr: This article discusses the different methods of enamel formation in osseous fish, focusing on the transformation of ameloblast cells in various species. The author presents four varieties of enamel formation processes and compares them to those found in other animals, ultimately disproving the idea that enamel is a secretion shed out from the ends of ameloblasts.
