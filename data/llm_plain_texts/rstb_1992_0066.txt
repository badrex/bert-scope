tldr: This study investigates the processing of complex sounds by the auditory system, specifically the masking release for gap detection. The researchers found that comodulation masking release and masking-level difference occur for both detection threshold and suprathreshold gap detection. However, the masking release for gap detection is generally smaller than that obtained for detection threshold. The results suggest that even though speech information may be more audible in comodulated noise, the quality of that information is poor.
