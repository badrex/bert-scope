tldr: The author, Henry Brougham, conducted experiments to study the inflection, reflection, and colors of light. He discovered that the bending force of light is inversely proportional to the distance from the refracting surface. Brougham also found that different colors of light have different inflection and reflection angles, with red light having the least inflection and violet light having the most. This research helped to further our understanding of the behavior of light and its colors.
