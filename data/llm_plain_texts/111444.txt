tldr: The author conducted experiments with the poison of the Antiaris toxicaria plant on frogs and discovered that it primarily affects the muscular system, including the heart, and causes paralysis. The poison acts rapidly on the heart, leading to a cessation of voluntary and reflex movements. The author also found that the poison affects the nervous trunks later than the muscles.
