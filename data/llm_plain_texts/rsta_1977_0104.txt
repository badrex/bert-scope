tldr: The authors studied fossil cosmic ray tracks in lunar samples to analyze the ancient cosmic ray composition. They found that the etchable radiation damage of these tracks was only slightly affected by the annealing process. The ancient cosmic ray Cr group to Fe ratio was deduced to be approximately 0.7-0.8, which is enhanced by a factor of about two compared to the present-day cosmic ray composition. This indicates that either a long-term change in the cosmic ray composition has occurred or the interpretation of track data is more complicated than previously assumed.
