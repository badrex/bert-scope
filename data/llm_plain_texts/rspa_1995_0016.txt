tldr: The authors present a method for solving nonlinear differential equations and boundary value problems in longitudinal shear using a reciprocal theorem and dual functions in the strain plane. They apply the method to various examples and demonstrate its effectiveness by comparing it to previous methods. The technique can be used for a range of nonlinear stress-strain laws and has applications in plane filtration, fluid mechanics, and material science.
