  - Muscle contraction
  - Actin and myosin
  - ATP
tldr: The authors used X-ray analysis to study the molecular structure of actin and myosin proteins in muscle under various conditions. They discovered that the long molecules in muscle are arranged in a hexagonal array and that the presence of ATP affects the electron density between these molecules. This research provides insights into the mechanism of muscle contraction.
