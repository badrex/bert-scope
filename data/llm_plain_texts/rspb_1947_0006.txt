tldr: This article investigates the composition and structure of insect cuticles, focusing on the blowfly larval cuticle and puparium. The authors found that the amount of chitin and protein remains constant during the hardening and darkening of the puparium. The weight increase is due to the incorporation of phenolic substances derived from free tyrosine in the blood. The study also provides a comprehensive review of the composition and properties of various cuticles, and suggests that hardening can occur without darkening.
