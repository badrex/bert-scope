tldr: The ammonium cyanate-urea conversion is studied in the presence of various polyelectrolytes and ionics surfactants. The results show that polyelectrolytes can significantly affect the reaction rate, with the catalytic influence being stronger for polyelectrolytes with a higher charge density. The study provides insights into the role of polyelectrolytes in catalysis and their interactions with ions in solution.
