tldr: This article investigates the stability of ships at various draughts of water and highlights the importance of considering the variation of stability with draught. The author demonstrates that light draught can be as unfavorable to stability as low freeboard and proposes a new method for analyzing ship stability, called cross curves of stability, which take into account the changes in displacement and righting moments at different draughts.
