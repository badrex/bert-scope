tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the chemical composition of chlorophyll and its derivatives. They discovered new compounds, such as chrysophyll and phyllotaonin, formed by the action of alkalis on phyllocyanin. These compounds have unique properties and contribute to the color and function of chlorophyll in plants.
