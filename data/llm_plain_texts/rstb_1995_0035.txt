tldr: The study investigates the role of sinigrin, a glucosinolate found in cruciferous plants, as a feeding deterrent for two crucifer-feeding, polyphagous lepidopterous species. The research examines the effects of varying sinigrin concentrations and the presence of feeding stimulants, such as inositol and sucrose, on the deterrency. Results show that sinigrin primarily reduces feeding in all backgrounds, but the effect varies with sinigrin concentration, background, and species. The deterrent effect of sinigrin is decreased when inositol or sucrose is included in the mixture, and suppression is greatest for M. configurata.
