tldr: The author investigates the global dynamical behavior of suspensions of small, orientable, non-interacting particles in recirculating flows. The patterns formed are a consequence of dynamical attractors that characterize the evolution of particle orientations with time. These patterns are spatially varying orientations or planes of orientations to which all particles are eventually attracted, leading to a preferred microscopic arrangement of the suspended phase.
