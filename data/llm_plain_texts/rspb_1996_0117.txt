tldr: This study investigates the condition-dependence and costs of drumming, a sexual display behavior, in male wolf spiders. The researchers found that drumming rate is condition-dependent, with males in better condition maintaining higher drumming rates. Additionally, they discovered that drumming is costly, as males with increased drumming activity suffered higher mortality and lost more weight. However, within the increased drumming treatment group, the most active drummers had higher survival rates, suggesting that drumming may be an honest signal of male quality for females.
