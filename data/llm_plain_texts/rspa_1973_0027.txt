tldr: This study presents the results of an extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectrometer experiment conducted by University College London to measure whole-Sun spectrum-line fluxes. The experiment was flown on the Orbiting Solar Observatory-6 and observed the Sun's EUV lines from August 1969 to February 1970. The study found relations between these fluxes and the 10.7 cm radio flux and Zurich sunspot number, which can help understand the heating mechanisms in Earth's atmosphere and the reaction of the atmosphere to solar activity changes.
