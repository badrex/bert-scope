tldr: The author presents a theory explaining the rotations of molecules in solids and the dielectric constant of solids and liquids. They discuss the concept of co-operative states and the critical temperatures associated with them. The theory is applied to Rochelle salt and other polar substances, and the results are compared with experimental data.
