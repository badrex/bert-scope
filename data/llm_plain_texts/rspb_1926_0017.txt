tldr: The authors studied the development of undifferentiated limb-buds of embryonic fowls when grafted subcutaneously into post-embryonic chicks and when cultivated in vitro. They observed that the limb-buds showed organotypic growth and underwent differentiation along normal lines. This research provides insights into the behavior of embryonic tissues in abnormal environments and contributes to the understanding of tissue differentiation and growth.
