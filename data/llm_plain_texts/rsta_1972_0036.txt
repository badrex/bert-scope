tldr: This article discusses the fault patterns and orientations in the Kent Coalfield, analyzing faulting in four major collieries. The authors measure and record fault orientations, directions of throw, and fault intensity to better understand the geology of the area and its implications for coal mining. The study provides insights into the regional and local variations in faulting, helping to inform future mine planning and geological mapping.
