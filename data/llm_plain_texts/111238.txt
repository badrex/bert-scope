tldr: This article discusses the author's discovery of a previously overlooked aspect of the moon's motion, which affects the secular acceleration of its mean motion. The author presents a new term in the expression for the moon's coordinates and its impact on the secular acceleration, leading to a revised understanding of the phenomenon.
