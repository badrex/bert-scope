tldr: This article presents the isotherms of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and their mixtures at high pressures. The authors developed an apparatus to determine the compressibility of gaseous media and found that neither the Law of Partial Pressures nor the Law of Additive Volumes is strictly obeyed for gas mixtures. The results provide valuable data for understanding the behavior of gases at high pressures and improving industrial processes.
