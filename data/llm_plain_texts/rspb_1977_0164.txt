tldr: This study investigates the regeneration of synaptic connections in leech ganglia maintained in organ culture. The researchers found that sensory neurons can regenerate and reform appropriate synaptic connections, with complex arborizations and branching occurring during the regeneration process. The findings contribute to understanding neuronal regeneration and the formation of functional connections in the central nervous system.
