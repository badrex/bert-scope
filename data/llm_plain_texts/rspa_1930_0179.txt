tldr: This article investigates the energy losses of electrons in nitrogen through inelastic collisions. The authors developed a method of velocity analysis to measure the energy given up by electrons during these impacts, focusing on the energy loss corresponding to transitions from the soft-ray levels of the nitrogen molecule. The results provide a more accurate value of energy loss compared to the photoelectric method and contribute to the understanding of electron collisions in gases.
