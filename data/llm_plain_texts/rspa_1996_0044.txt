tldr: This study investigates the fuel-type characterization of carbonaceous fly-ash particles using energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) surface chemistries. The technique is applied to particles extracted from lake sediments, providing information on potential sources of associated airborne pollutants and aiding in indirect dating of sediment cores. The method can be used in various environments and has potential applications in Britain, Europe, and globally.
