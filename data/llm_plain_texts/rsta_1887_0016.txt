revised_title: Applications of Dynamical Principles to Physical Phenomena
semantic_tags:
  - Thermodynamics
  - Energy Conservation
  - Second Law of Thermodynamics
  - Hamiltonian Principles
  - Kinetic Theory of Gases
tldr: The author discusses the applications of dynamical principles to various physical phenomena, focusing on the two laws of thermodynamics and their connection to other principles. They explore the use of Hamiltonian principles and the relationship between temperature and kinetic energy, particularly in the context of gases and the principle of least action.
