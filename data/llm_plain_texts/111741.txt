tldr: The author, Professor Graham, discusses the osmotic force, a natural phenomenon where liquids pass through porous membranes. He explains that osmotic force is not caused by diffusion or capillarity, but rather by chemical action. The author also explores the applications of osmotic force in biological systems and the potential for it to be a source of motive power in animal functions.
