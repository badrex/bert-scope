tldr: 'The authors studied the vapour pressure and rate of evaporation of potassium chloride using an effusion method. They determined the latent heat of vaporization and found that the evaporation coefficient for different crystal faces is independent of temperature. This research contributes to understanding the process of crystal growth and evaporation rates of ionic crystals.'
