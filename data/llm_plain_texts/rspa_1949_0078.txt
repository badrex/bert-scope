tldr: This article discusses recent advancements in submarine gravity surveying techniques, focusing on the development of a stabilizer that automatically compensates for side accelerations on pendulums, allowing for faster and more accurate gravity measurements. The stabilizer, along with other improvements in equipment and navigation systems, enabled the authors to conduct more efficient surveys and gather valuable data for understanding the Earth's gravity field and its geological implications.
