tldr: The study investigates the effect of extrajunctional axonal crush on the junctional resistance of two electrotonically coupled giant neurons in the snail Lymnaea. The researchers found a statistically significant reduction in junctional resistance within the first 3 hours after the crush compared to controls. This discovery provides insights into the changes that occur in neuronal communication after injury.
