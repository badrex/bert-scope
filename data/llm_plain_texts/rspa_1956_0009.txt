tldr: The authors developed a new method to correlate magnetic temperature scales of paramagnetic salts using cerium magnesium nitrate as a magnetic thermometer. They determined the susceptibilities of several paramagnetic salts at temperatures below 1 Kelvin, providing a more accurate measure of temperature and improving thermometry at low temperatures. This method can be applied to various paramagnetic salts, enhancing the understanding of their magnetic properties and temperature scales.
