tldr: The author conducted extensive research on the distribution of nerves in the fibers of striped muscles in various animals. They discovered that nerves are distributed to every elementary fiber of voluntary muscles in humans and vertebrate animals, with some animals having more abundant nerve supplies than others. The study also found that nerves can branch and subdivide before reaching their ultimate distribution, and that the delicate structure of these nerves can be easily destroyed by improper preservation or manipulation.
