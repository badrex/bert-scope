tldr: The authors conducted experiments using an isolated perfused rat heart to study the transport of particles, such as thorium dioxide, saccharated iron oxide, and ferritin, across the walls of small blood vessels. They observed that these particles entered the vesicles of the endothelium and passed through the cells of the endothelium into the perivascular spaces. The results provide evidence for the active transport of particles and large molecules across the capillary walls, suggesting that the semi-permeable characteristics of the capillary wall reside outside the cell, possibly in the basement membrane.
