tldr: In this paper, John F. W. Herschel explores the chemical actions of the rays in the solar spectrum on various substances, both metallic and non-metallic, and discusses their impact on photographic processes. He also describes a method to create photographic coatings on glass and experiments with different metal salts. Furthermore, he investigates the chemical analysis of the solar spectrum and its effects on photographic paper, vegetable colors, and the development of an actinograph for meteorological purposes.
