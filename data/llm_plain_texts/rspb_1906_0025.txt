tldr: This article examines the growth of the oocyte in Antedon bifida and its relation to cell metabolism. The author investigates the role of the nucleolus, chromatin, and cytoplasm in the growth process, concluding that these structures play a role in waste material management and the overall growth of the oocyte. The study provides insights into the complex processes within cells and the role of different structures in cell growth and development.
