tldr: This article investigates the absorption of carbonic acid by different saline solutions, particularly in sea water. The author finds that certain salts, such as sulfate of magnesia and chloride of sodium, can affect the absorption of carbonic acid. The study also reveals that sea water can hold a large amount of carbonic acid, which is important for understanding the chemistry of the ocean and its impact on marine life.
