tldr: The authors investigated the growth of long-chain fatty acid crystals, specifically palmitic acid, and discovered two polymorphic forms. They used X-ray diffraction and interferometric techniques to study the crystal's structure and found that these crystals exhibit polytypism, which has not been observed through X-ray diffraction experiments before. This research provides insights into the complex structures and growth mechanisms of long-chain organic molecular crystals.
