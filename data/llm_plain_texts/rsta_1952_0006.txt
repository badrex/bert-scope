tldr: This article presents an experimental study of the collapse of liquid columns on a rigid horizontal plane, focusing on the two-dimensional collapse of rectangular and semicircular sections and the three-dimensional axial collapse of right circular cylinders. The authors examine the velocity of the fluid spread and the rate of fall of the top of the column during the collapse process and discuss the scaling laws and their implications for larger-scale phenomena.
