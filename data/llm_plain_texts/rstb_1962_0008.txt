tldr: The article investigates the mechanical properties of locust cuticle, specifically the solid and rubber-like types found in the desert locust. It explores the role of these materials in locust flight and examines the composition and behavior of the cuticle, including the presence of chitin and resilin. The study also suggests a three-component model of arthropod cuticle, which accounts for the differences in mechanical properties between adjacent parts.
