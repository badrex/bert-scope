tldr: 'The author presents a mathematical analysis of patterned ground formation and solar radiation ground heating in a saturated horizontal porous layer. The study focuses on the onset of cellular convection in the layer, which is subject to a time-periodic boundary condition. The research is based on the formation of polygonal ground, a geological phenomenon consisting of stone borders forming regular hexagons and soil centers. The author compares the critical Rayleigh numbers and wavenumbers of linear theory and the energy method, using the Galerkin method and Floquet theory to obtain numerical predictions.'
