tldr: The authors developed a method to measure the aqueous vapour-pressure of capillary systems by using the freezing-point depression of benzene. This method is useful for studying the water content in soils and other materials with low water content. The results suggest that a fine capillary structure may exist in some soils, which could help explain how water is held in these systems.
