tldr: This report compares short-term inequalities in sunspot areas with diurnal temperature ranges at Toronto and Kew. The authors argue that these short-period inequalities are less likely to be affected by changes in atmospheric absorption, making the comparison more reliable. They explore two methods for comparing solar and terrestrial inequalities, focusing on the strong analogy between diurnal temperature range and solar declination range.
