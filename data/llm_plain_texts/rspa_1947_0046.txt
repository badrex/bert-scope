tldr: The authors investigated the inversion spectrum of ammonia at centimetre wave-lengths using a resonant cavity technique. They identified twenty-nine lines corresponding to different rotational quantum states and found that the wave numbers of these lines can be accurately represented by a specific formula. The study also revealed the absorption coefficients and the effects of collision broadening on the lines, providing insights into the molecular structure and behavior of ammonia.
