tldr: This article explores the role of cell-context signaling in plant development, specifically focusing on the polysaccharide epitopes present at the surfaces of plant cells. The authors use monoclonal antibody probes to sort single cells in carrot somatic cell cultures based on the presence or absence of specific polysaccharide epitopes. They find that specific populations of precursor cells induce and sustain early plant development, revealing the importance of different cell collectives in regulating plant development. The communication between these precursor cells and embryo initials defines an early cell-cell interaction in developing carrot plants.
