tldr: This article discusses the effect of collisions on the magnetic behavior of large systems, specifically the influence of collisions on the magnetic susceptibility. The author finds that the non-periodic term in the susceptibility is hardly affected by collisions, while the periodic terms are reduced in magnitude. The study also explores the differences in collision times involved in conduction processes and diamagnetism, and how these times depend on the appropriate values of energy levels and magnetic fields.
