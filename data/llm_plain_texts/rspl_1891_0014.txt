  - Safety lamps
tldr: The author studied the properties of alloys made of nickel and iron, specifically their density and magnetic properties. They discovered that these alloys have a 2% lower density when magnetizable compared to when they are not. The author also discussed the development of a safety lamp that can serve both as an illuminator and a firedamp detector for mines.
