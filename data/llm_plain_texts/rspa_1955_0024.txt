tldr: This article presents the measurement of charge transfer cross-sections for protons, molecular hydrogen ions, and helium ions in rare gases and hydrogen, as well as electron detachment cross-sections for negative atomic hydrogen ions in rare gases. The experiments cover ion energies ranging from 3 to 40 keV and 100 to 4000 eV, and the results are discussed in terms of the pseudo-adiabatic hypothesis. The authors compare their findings with other experimental results and discuss anomalous molecular cases in terms of reactions involving anti-bonding states.
