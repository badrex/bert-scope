tldr: This study investigates the ability of human observers to make discriminations between changes in illuminant and changes in reflecting properties of scenes. It explores the potential of cone-excitation ratios as a basis for perceptual colour constancy in terms of colour relations. The research shows that a coding of colour relations in terms of ratios could provide an observer with the necessary information to make the required discriminations.
