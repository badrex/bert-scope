tldr: The authors develop a mathematical model to study one-dimensional inclusion compounds, focusing on commensurate and incommensurate behaviors. They define commensurate behavior as when the interaction between host and guest substructures is sensitive to the guest's position along the channel axis, and incommensurate behavior as when it is insensitive. The model allows for understanding how these behaviors depend on the ratio of repeat distances of host and guest substructures and can be used to determine the optimal guest periodicity for a specific inclusion compound.
