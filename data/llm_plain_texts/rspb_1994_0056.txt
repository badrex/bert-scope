tldr: The author explores the advantage of extended parental care in the evolution of eusocial insects. By providing overlapping care from multiple adults, eusocial insects can increase offspring survivorship and improve their ecological success compared to competitors. The author presents six distinct models that demonstrate how extended care can lead to the evolution of eusociality, highlighting the importance of parental care in the development of this unique social structure.
