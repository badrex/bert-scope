tldr: This article presents research on solar physics, specifically the positions and areas of sunspots observed at Kew Observatory during 1864-66. The authors also analyze the spotted area of the Sun's visible disk from 1832 to 1868. They discuss the solar cycle, the variability of the period, and the influence of planetary conjunctions on solar activity. Additionally, they compare the sun's behavior to that of variable stars like R Sagittae and 3 Lyrae.
