tldr: The authors developed a non-local continuum damage approach to model grain size effects in creep crack growth. They used a finite domain analysis to predict the size effect on creep crack growth in copper materials. The study showed that the non-local damage method can better capture the damage distribution and improve computational efficiency compared to the local damage method.
