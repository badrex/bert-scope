tldr: This article explores the nature of the physical processes occurring in the electric arc and the mechanism by which it conducts electricity. The author proposes a new method to determine the resistance and electromotive force of the arc by using high-frequency oscillations and analyzing the power factor. The study aims to provide a better understanding of the electric arc's behavior and its potential applications in various fields.
