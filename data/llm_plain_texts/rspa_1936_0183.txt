tldr: The authors determined the crystal structure of H3PW12O40.29H2O using powder X-ray diffraction. They found a unique diamond lattice structure composed of two interpenetrating complexes, one with anions (PW12O40)3 and the other with water molecules and hydrogen ions. The structure is a regular alternation of anions and cations, with each anion identical to the one found in the 5-hydrate.
