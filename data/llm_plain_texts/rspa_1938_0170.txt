tldr: This study investigates the rates of transformation of ammonium and ethylammonium cyanates to their corresponding ureas in ethyl alcohol. The authors found that the reaction follows a bimolecular mechanism and that the rates of transformation are influenced by neutral salts. The results provide insights into the reaction mechanism and the factors affecting the reaction rates.
