tldr: Peter Barlow investigated the influence of gradients on the motion of a load drawn by a locomotive engine. He pointed out that previous estimations were flawed due to not considering the pressure of the atmosphere on the piston. Barlow assumed equal quantities of steam were produced at all velocities and used data from Mr. Pambour's Treatise of Locomotive Engines for his calculations.
