tldr: This article explores conserved quantities of spinning test particles in general relativity. The author presents a general scheme to investigate these quantities, showing that the general linear conserved quantity consists of a sum, the first term of which is the well-known expression constructed from a Killing vector field, and the second term is of the form where is a Killing-Yano tensor field, which is constrained by two additional equations. This work aims to understand the physical meaning of these conserved quantities and their implications in the context of spinning test particles in curved backgrounds.
