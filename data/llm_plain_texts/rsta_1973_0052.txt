tldr: The authors analyzed a year of continuous strain data in California, revealing a secular strain rate and an apparent yearly cycle of strain amplitude. They found that thermoelastic effects play a significant role in both yearly and tidal periods. The analysis of three-component strain tides showed discrepancies between predicted Earth tide and the observed strain tide, suggesting the need for further refinements in ocean tide models and loading Green's functions.
