tldr: The author investigates the effect of temperature on the permeability of protoplasmic membranes in plant cells. They measure the electric resistance of plant tissues at different temperatures to understand how temperature affects the permeability of the cell membrane to electrolytes. The study focuses on the leaf of Aloe perfoliata and provides insights into the relationship between temperature and membrane permeability in plant cells.
