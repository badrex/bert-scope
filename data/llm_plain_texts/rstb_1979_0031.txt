tldr: 'This article explores the role of land crabs in the Aldabran ecosystem. These crabs play a significant part in energy transfer between land and sea, preventing colonization by exotic plant species, and aiding in leaf litter breakdown. They also contribute to soil aeration and provide habitats for other animals. The article highlights the various ways land crabs impact the Aldabran ecosystem, including their scavenging and herbivorous behaviors.'
