tldr: The 1971 Royal Society - Percy Sladen Expedition to the New Hebrides aimed to study the flora and fauna of the islands, focusing on their biogeography and the ecology of representative plant communities. The expedition explored six major islands and collected data on climate, geology, soils, and forest types. The findings provide insights into the unique characteristics of the New Hebrides' ecosystems and their distinctiveness compared to other island groups in the region.
