tldr: The author conducted experiments to measure the rate of ionization in various gases, including air, hydrogen, carbonic acid, sulfur dioxide, and chloroform. The results showed that, except for hydrogen, the ionization was nearly proportional to the gas density. The author also compared the findings with gases exposed to radium radiation, showing a similarity in the results.
