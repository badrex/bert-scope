tldr: The author studies the ultrastructure of Gymnosphaera albida, a marine axopodiate protozoon, and discovers similarities with Acantharia and some Radiolaria. The protozoon has a unique body structure divided into three zones, with axonemes radiating from the axoplast to the axopodia. The author suggests that the classification of Gymnosphaera may be improved with more information on the ultrastructure and life histories of axopodiate species.
