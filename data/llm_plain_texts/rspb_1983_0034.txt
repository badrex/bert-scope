tldr: The study examines the unique urogenital system of female lumpsucker fish, focusing on the fused ovaries and oviducts, the large urinary bladder, and the kidney. The research reveals the system's adaptations for maintaining low Mg2+ and Ca2+ concentrations in blood and ovarian fluid, as well as its water resorptive function. The findings contribute to understanding the reproductive strategy and osmotic relations of the lumpsucker fish.
