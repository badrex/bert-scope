tldr: This study examines the activity of the enzyme /?-galactosidase in bacteria during their growth cycle. The researchers found that the enzyme activity changes in response to the environment, with a rapid increase at the end of the logarithmic phase. They also discovered that oxygen starvation plays a significant role in this increase. The findings suggest that the enzyme activity is a protective mechanism for the bacteria in adverse conditions.
