tldr: This article discusses the Precambrian geology of northern West Greenland, focusing on the Umanak-Rinks Isbrae area. The authors describe the evolution of the Precambrian crust, the presence of recumbent folding and flat-lying structures in the gneisses, and the role of lateral adjustments in the gneiss infrastructure during the metamorphism and doming of the younger metasedimentary suprastructure. The study concludes that crustal shortening has not played a significant part in the structural development of the area.
