tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the electric fish Malapterurus electricus to determine the electromotive force and electrical resistance of its organ. They used a capillary electrometer and a nerve organ preparation to analyze the organ's response to electrical stimulation. The results showed that the organ's response had a longer initial delay and a longer duration compared to previous experiments, likely due to the lower temperature used in this study.
