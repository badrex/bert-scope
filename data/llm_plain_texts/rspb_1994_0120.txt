tldr: The authors discovered that odorants not activating the cAMP cascade in olfactory neurons can inhibit electrical activity, cause membrane hyperpolarization, and trigger a potassium-selective, tetraethylammonium-sensitive outward current. This finding suggests that the K+ current is responsible for odorant-induced inhibition of action potential firing in olfactory neurons.
