tldr: This article explores the geometric theory of local and non-local conservation laws for the sine-Gordon equation, a nonlinear evolution equation. The authors extend the geometric theory to include the Hamiltonian structure of the equation and demonstrate that the set of polynomial conserved densities is incomplete. They also prove that a complete set of conserved densities for the sine-Gordon equation necessarily includes non-local densities, which are in involution.
