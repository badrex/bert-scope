tldr: The authors investigated the kinetics of reactions between sheep haemoglobin and isocyanides. They found that the initial rate of combination decreases with increasing chain length. The rate of dissociation of the first isocyanide molecule from saturated haemoglobin is the same for all members of the series. The study provides insights into the 'crevice' hypothesis of haemoglobin structure and contributes to understanding the differences in affinity between isocyanides.
