tldr: The author, James Smithson, conducted a chemical analysis of a zeolite sample to determine its composition. The zeolite was found to be a compound salt, a hydrated silicate of alumina and soda. The analysis showed that the zeolite consisted of silica, alumina, soda, and a trace of sulfate. The author also discussed the possibility of undiscovered acids in stony crystals and the composition of other minerals like topaz and tourmaline.
