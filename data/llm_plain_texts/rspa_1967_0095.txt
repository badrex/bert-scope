tldr: The authors demonstrate that the post-Newtonian equations of Einstein, Infeld, and Hoffmann are invariant to a specific post-Galilean transformation. This transformation allows for the consideration of a 'centre of mass system' in the context of post-Newtonian theory, expanding our understanding of the motion of mass points under gravitational attraction.
