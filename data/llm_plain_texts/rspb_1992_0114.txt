tldr: The authors developed a permutation test to detect gene conversion in primate visual pigment genes. They applied this test to the sequences of red- and green-sensitive visual pigment genes of humans and the Diana monkey. The results convincingly excluded the occurrence of gene conversion in the absence of gene conversion, providing insights into the evolution of multigene families.
