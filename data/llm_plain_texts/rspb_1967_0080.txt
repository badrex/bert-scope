tldr: The article investigates the effects of 2-thiouracil on the growth and metabolism of plant roots. The author found that 2-thiouracil stimulates root growth and expansion, especially when combined with a simple sugar. The study also shows that substances like indole-3-acetic acid, D-threochloramphenicol, and actinomycin D can affect or even abolish the stimulation caused by 2-thiouracil. The research provides insights into the role of nucleic acid analogues in plant growth and development.
