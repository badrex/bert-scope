tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the nature of beta-rays excited by alpha-rays. They found that the chance of an alpha-ray making a beta-ray is roughly proportional to the atomic weight of the radiator. The results suggest that beta-radiation is most likely to be produced when the alpha-ray is suddenly stopped or loses a great part of its energy. The authors conclude that beta-rays are entities with a direction nearly that of the alpha-ray they come from.
