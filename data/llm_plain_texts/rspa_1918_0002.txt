tldr: This article discusses the phenomena of turbulence in the lower atmosphere, focusing on the transfer of heat, water vapor, and momentum through eddies. The author analyzes temperature measurements taken from the Eiffel Tower to determine the effect of turbulence on the atmosphere's ability to transmit heat and momentum. The study reveals that turbulence decreases with height in the winter and increases in the summer, with the daily variation in temperature gradient playing a significant role in this change.
