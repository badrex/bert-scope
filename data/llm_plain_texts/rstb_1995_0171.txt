tldr: This study examines the large-scale dynamics and community structure of forest birds in eucalypt forests of southeastern Australia. The author found that continental bird communities are highly dynamic, making it difficult for community patterns to develop due to the mobility of species. The research also highlights the importance of habitat specificity and dynamic strategies in understanding bird community structure.
