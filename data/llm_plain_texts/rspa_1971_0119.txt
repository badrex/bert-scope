tldr: The Kolar Gold Fields neutrino experiment studied the interactions of cosmic ray neutrinos deep underground. Clear examples of neutrino-induced muons were recorded, including cases of upward-moving particles and neutrino interactions within the detector assembly. The observed rate of events was compared with expectations, and conclusions were made about the variation of the inelastic cross-section with energy and the lower limit to the mass of the intermediate boson.
