tldr: The authors conducted experiments on single crystals of zinc to study their behavior under alternating torsional stresses. They found that the formation of twins in zinc occurred on specific planes, and the choice of the operative pair was influenced by normal stress on the twinning plane. The results provided insights into the mechanical properties of zinc and its potential applications in engineering.
