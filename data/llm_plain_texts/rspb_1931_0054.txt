tldr: The authors investigated the infection of sandflies with Leishmania infantum and observed the natural parasites of wild sandflies in Catania. They also studied the behavior of Trypanosoma ptyodactyli in these sandflies. The findings provide insights into the transmission and development of the parasites within the sandflies, which can help in understanding the spread of the disease.
