tldr: This study examines the growth rate of Bacterium lactis aerogenes colonies on agar plates containing drugs. The authors found that the rate of development of resistant forms in trained cultures is consistent with the occurrence of adaptations in competition with lethal actions on the plate. The resistance of re-tested strains after isolation from resistant colonies is highly variable.
