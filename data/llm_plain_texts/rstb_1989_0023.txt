tldr: The article discusses the concept and operational definition of protein epitopes, which are the parts of a protein that are specifically recognized by the binding sites or paratopes of certain immunoglobulin molecules. It explains that epitopes are relational entities that require complementary paratopes for their operational recognition and can be defined only in a functional and operational sense by the binding of these paratopes. The article also covers the different types of epitopes, such as continuous and discontinuous epitopes, and the challenges in identifying and understanding their role in immune recognition.
