tldr: The author, Henry Cavendish, describes an experiment to determine the precise freezing point of mercury using a specially designed thermometer. The experiment involves immersing the thermometer in a freezing mixture and observing the contraction of mercury as it freezes. The results show that mercury contracts in the act of freezing, and the author provides a method for accurately measuring the freezing point of mercury using thermometers with wooden and ivory scales.
