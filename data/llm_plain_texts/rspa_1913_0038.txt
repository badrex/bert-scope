tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the causes of variation in the optical rotatory power of organic compounds and anomalous rotatory dispersion. They discovered that different solvents and concentrations can significantly affect the rotatory power of certain substances, such as tartrates. The authors proposed a new method, called the characteristic diagram, to analyze and understand these effects.
