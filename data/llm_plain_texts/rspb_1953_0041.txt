tldr: The study investigates the electrolyte flux in isolated mitochondria and how they maintain a constant potassium concentration against adverse gradients. The findings support the view that mitochondria possess a semipermeable membrane and that oxidative phosphorylation plays a direct or indirect role in maintaining potassium concentration.
