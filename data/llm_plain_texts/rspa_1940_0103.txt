tldr: The authors investigated the infra-red and Raman spectra of hydro- and deuterochloric acid at liquid nitrogen temperatures. They found that the solid hydrochloric acid's infra-red absorption spectrum had a doublet band structure, while the Raman spectrum showed a similar structure. The results suggest that the association of HCl and DCl molecules in the crystal below the transition temperature can occur in different ways.
