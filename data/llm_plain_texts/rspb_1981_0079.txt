tldr: The study investigates the pathways taken by chick lumbosacral motoneurons during normal development. The authors found that axons destined for a single muscle are intermingled with other axons in the spinal nerves and proximal plexus but converge to form a discrete tract in the distal plexus. This research helps to understand the mechanisms involved in the establishment of specific neuronal connections in the chick hindlimb.
