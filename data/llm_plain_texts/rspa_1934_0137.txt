tldr: The author used mass spectroscopy to analyze the isotopic constitution and atomic weights of rare earth elements. They discovered multiple isotopes in elements such as cerium, neodymium, and samarium, providing a more accurate understanding of these complex elements. The study also emphasized the importance of using pure materials for accurate analysis.
