revised_title: Plastic Yielding and Crack Behavior in Notched Plates
semantic_tags:
  - Plasticity
  - Notch Brittle
  - Crack Growth
  - Dislocation Theory
  - Fatigue
tldr: The authors study the spread of plasticity from a periodic sequence of cracks in an infinite isotropic elastic medium under external shear stress. They compare the results with a theory of plastic zones around notches in finite plates and discuss the implications for notch brittleness and high-strain fatigue.
