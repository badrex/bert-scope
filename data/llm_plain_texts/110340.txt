tldr: The author, George Fisher, conducted a series of experiments to determine the relative intensities of magnetic forces in various locations in Europe and Asia Minor. He found that the forces were greater in elevated situations and that there was great irregularity in the numerical results. The cause of these irregularities remains uncertain.
