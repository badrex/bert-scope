tldr: This article discusses cytochemical studies of protein transport in the nervous system, focusing on the transport of enzymes and other components in neurons. The author investigates the routes and mechanisms by which proteins are distributed throughout the cell and the roles of non-neuronal cells associated with neurons in modifying interactions with the extracellular medium.
