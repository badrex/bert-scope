revised_title: 'The Relationship Between Ciliary Movement and Oxygen Consumption'
semantic_tags:
  - Ciliary movement
  - Oxygen consumption
  - Anaesthetics
  - Fatty acids
  - Oxygen absorption
tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the relationship between ciliary movement and oxygen consumption in cells. They discovered that although ciliary movement is ultimately dependent on atmospheric oxygen, the gas is not directly required by the mobile mechanism. Oxygen is necessary for maintaining the conditions in the cell for prolonged activity. The study also found that fatty acids and anaesthetics can inhibit both movement and oxygen consumption, but the degree of mechanical activity is not necessarily proportional to the amount of oxygen absorbed.
