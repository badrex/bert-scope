tldr: The author describes the fossil remains of two species of a reptile (Meiolania) found on Lord Howe Island. The fossils were carefully extracted from the coral-sand rock and analyzed, revealing differences in size and characteristics between the two species. The author compares the findings to a similar reptile species, Megalania prisca, and concludes that the differences between the two are significant enough to warrant a separate generic or sub-generic distinction.
