tldr: The authors determined the crystal structures of barytes, celestine, and anglesite using X-ray crystallography. They found that all three crystals have similar structures, with oxygen atoms forming a tetrahedral arrangement around a central sulfur atom. This research contributes to the understanding of crystal structures and the properties of these minerals.
