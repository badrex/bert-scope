tldr: The authors studied the emission spectra of halogen afterglows and discovered new chemiluminescent reactions between bromine atoms and chlorine dioxide. They analyzed the vibrational constants and discussed the mechanisms of population of various vibrational levels in the excited states of the afterglow spectra.
