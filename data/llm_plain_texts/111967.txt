tldr: The author investigates the chemical reactions between chloracetic ether and triethylamine and triethylphosphine. The main products of these reactions are ammonium salts with double substitution, where the complex atom in chloracetic ether replaces one hydrogen equivalent of the ammonium. The author also examines the properties and compositions of these new compounds, comparing them to similar substances in the nitrogen and phosphorus series.
