tldr: This article discusses the relaxation methods applied to engineering problems, specifically focusing on plastic straining in two-dimensional stress-systems. The authors propose a generalization of the hypothesis underlying the Mises-Hencky criterion and explore the stress-strain relations in plastic enclaves, providing a basis for solving complex stress problems.
