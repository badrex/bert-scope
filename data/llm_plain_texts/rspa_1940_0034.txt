tldr: The dehydration of chrome alum crystals was studied to understand the processes occurring at the interface between the reactant and product solid phases. The researchers observed the formation of two types of nuclei, their growth rates, and the effects of temperature and water vapor on the dehydration process. The dehydration of chrome alum forms a case intermediate between copper sulfate pentahydrate and manganous oxalate bihydrate.
