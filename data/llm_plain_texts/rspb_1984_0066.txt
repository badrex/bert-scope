tldr: The authors investigated the slow inward current (isi) in the rabbit sino-atrial (SA) node using voltage clamp techniques and computer simulations. They found that isi inactivation is calcium-entry dependent and has a slower recovery from inactivation compared to other systems. The study suggests that there are two components of total isi: a fast inward current and a slower inward current component caused by sodium-calcium exchange. These findings provide insights into the complex processes controlling the slow inward current in the SA node and its role in generating rhythmic activity.
