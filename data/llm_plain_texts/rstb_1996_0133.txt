tldr: This article discusses the executive and cognitive functions of the prefrontal cortex, comparing experimental studies in humans and monkeys. It explores the differences and similarities in short-term memory deficits, the role of the prefrontal cortex in working memory processes, and the impact of lesions on cognitive performance. The authors highlight the importance of understanding the complex interactions between frontal and posterior cortical areas for a comprehensive understanding of working memory and executive functions.
