tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the relationship between mitosis, respiration, and oxygen tension in excised pea-root tips. They found that extreme oxygen-lack can arrest mitosis, and the respiration of root tips is limited by slow oxygen diffusion through the tissue. The study provides insights into the mechanisms that may be responsible for the complicated relationship between mitosis and oxygen tension.
