tldr: The authors studied the slow combustion of cyclopentane in coated and uncoated vessels, investigating the kinetics and analyzing the effect of different surfaces on the reaction rates. They found that the oxidation is a free-radical chain reaction with delayed branching, and that H02 radicals are of minor importance. The main termination step is homogeneous. The results provide insights into the combustion process and the role of surfaces in affecting reaction rates.
