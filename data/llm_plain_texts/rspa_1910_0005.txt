tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the distribution of X-rays from a focus bulb, using a Röntgen tube with a cathode rays focus on an anticathode. They found that the intensity of X-rays was not uniform and suggested improvements to the design of the bulb to enhance efficiency and safety. The authors also discussed the effects of varying the hardness of the X-rays and the impact of oblique and normal incidence of cathode rays on the distribution of X-rays.
