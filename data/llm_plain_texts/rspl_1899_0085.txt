tldr: The author presents a case study of a patient with monochromatic vision, where the patient could only see in one color, in this case, blue. The patient had a defective vision and was color blind. The author also compared the patient's luminosity curve with a normal eye and another case study, showing similarities in their curves. This study contributes to understanding color vision and vision defects.
