tldr: The authors present a comprehensive theory for interpreting magnetic resonance data on salts of the rare earths. They focus on determining the ground state, deriving the spin-Hamiltonian, and considering the effects of external magnetic fields and nuclear interactions. The study assumes a high degree of symmetry in the crystal field and provides a reference source for future theoretical work on specific salts.
