tldr: The authors developed a refractometric method using an interferometer to study the non-stationary state of chemical reactions, particularly the polymerization of styrene, methyl methacrylate, methyl acrylate, and vinyl acetate. This method allows for the measurement of velocity coefficients of elementary reactions and provides a check on other non-stationary state methods. The technique is based on the refractive index changes accompanying the reaction and can be applied to various transparent homogeneous liquids, such as electrolytes.
