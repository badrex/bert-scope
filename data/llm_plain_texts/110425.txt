tldr: The author, Richard Owen, studied the ovary and reproductive system of the Ornithorhynchus paradoxus, a unique egg-laying mammal. He found that this species has a mode of reproduction similar to that of some reptiles and that it serves as a connecting link between oviparous and viviparous mammals. This research also confirmed the possibility of lactation coexisting with ovo-viviparous reproduction.
