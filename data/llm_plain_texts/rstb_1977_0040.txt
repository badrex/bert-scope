tldr: The article discusses the prenatal development of the visual system in rhesus monkeys, focusing on the generation, migration, and pattern of distribution of neurons in the retina, dorsal lateral geniculate body, superior colliculus, and primary visual cortex. The study uses the method of [3H]thymidine autoradiography to determine the time of origin of neurons and analyze the development of connections in the visual system.
