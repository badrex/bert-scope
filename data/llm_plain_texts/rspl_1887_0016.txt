tldr: The author presents a method for calculating the harmonic components of a series representing a phenomenon that recurs daily or yearly. The method simplifies computation and improves accuracy for meteorological and astronomical data. The author demonstrates the technique for a series of five-day mean values, which is useful for meteorological purposes.
