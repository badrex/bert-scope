tldr: The authors present a mathematical formulation to analyze cracks in layered transversely isotropic media. They construct Green's functions using potentials and integral transforms, and obtain full-space Green's functions in closed forms. The crack opening displacement and crack-tip opening displacement for a vertical planar crack in a layered transversely isotropic medium are obtained numerically using the boundary integral equation method.
