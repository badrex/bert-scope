tldr: This paper investigates the velocity of sound by comparing Laplace's corrected formula with Dulong's theoretical investigation and the experiments of Drs. Moll and Van Beek. The author applies coefficients to the formula to improve the accuracy of calculated velocities and discusses the remaining differences between calculation and experiment, attributing them to unavoidable errors in complex observations.
