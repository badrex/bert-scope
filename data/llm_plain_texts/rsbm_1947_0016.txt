tldr: John William Watson Stephens was a prominent medical researcher who made significant contributions to the understanding of malaria and blackwater fever. He worked with S.R. Christophers on the Malaria Commission of the Royal Society and Colonial Office, discovering the role of native children in the transmission of malaria to Europeans. His research laid the foundation for modern anti-malaria measures and the study of endemicity in malaria. Stephens also published a book on blackwater fever in 1937, summarizing the knowledge of the disease at the time.
