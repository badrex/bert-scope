tldr: The authors developed a mathematical model to study the viscoelastic behavior of the lithosphere and asthenosphere during cyclic displacements on the San Andreas Fault. They found that the interaction between the elastic lithosphere and the viscoelastic asthenosphere damps out the time-dependence at large distances from the fault, with the relaxation process characterized by a time scale and a Newtonian viscosity. This model helps to understand the time dependence of strain as a function of distance from the San Andreas Fault.
