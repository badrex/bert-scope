tldr: This article discusses the observations made at various Swedish Bessemer steel works and the accurate measurements of bands and lines observed in the flame during the "blow" process. The author suggests the possible origin of some of the lines and bands, including the "blue flame" spectrum, and proposes further research to determine the exact causes of the observed phenomena.
