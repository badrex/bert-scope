tldr: The article studies the occurrence of stochastic synchronization and phase locking in large assemblies of coupled stochastic oscillators modeled as phase-angle stochastic processes. It focuses on discrete phase-angle spaces and explores the conditions under which stochastic synchronization emerges in these assemblies. The findings are applied to assemblies of stochastic fireflies and neuronal oscillators, leading to predictions for real biological networks of neurons.
