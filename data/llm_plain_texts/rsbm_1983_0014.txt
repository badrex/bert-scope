tldr: This article is a biographical memoir of Edward George Tandy Liddell, a prominent figure in the field of physiology and neuroscience. Liddell worked closely with Sir Charles Sherrington, focusing on the neuronal basis of reflex activity and the study of synapses. His work involved the development of innovative experimental methods, such as the isometric torsion-wire optical myograph, which allowed for a more precise analysis of muscle contractions and reflexes. Liddell's contributions to the field have had a lasting impact on the understanding of central excitation and inhibition in the nervous system.
