tldr: This article continues the study of the potential of an anchor ring, focusing on mathematical calculations and formulas. The authors use coordinates to determine the potential of external and internal points within the anchor ring. They also discuss the double integral taken over a circle of radius, providing a deeper understanding of the potential's properties.
