tldr: The authors discuss the importance of enzyme-substrate complementarity for catalytic efficiency. They explain that enzymes with structures complementary to the transition state of their substrates have a higher catalytic rate. Additionally, enzymes should have evolved to have values above accessible substrate concentrations to optimize reaction rates. This can be achieved through a "distortionless" strain, which involves unfavorable interactions in the enzyme-substrate complex that are relieved in the transition state or increasingly favorable interactions in the transition state.
