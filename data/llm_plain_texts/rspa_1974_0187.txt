tldr: The article presents an improved analysis of the energy levels of singly ionized potassium (KII) using Hartree-Fock calculations. The authors calculate the positions and g-factors of twelve KI configurations and compare their results with previous observations. The study provides a more detailed theoretical interpretation of the KI energy level spectrum, including the effects of configuration mixing.
