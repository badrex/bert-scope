tldr: 'The authors analyze the dynamics of smallpox epidemics in England during the 17th and 18th centuries, finding two distinct patterns: endemic disease in large cities and 5-year epidemics in medium-sized rural towns. They use computer modeling to explore the factors contributing to these different patterns, including fluctuations in susceptibility and population size.'
