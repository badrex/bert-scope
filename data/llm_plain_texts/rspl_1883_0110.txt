revised_title: On the Motion of Fluid with Rotational and Irrotational Components
semantic_tags:
  - Fluid dynamics
  - Vortex dynamics
  - Irrotational motion
  - Rotational motion
  - Hydrodynamics
tldr: The author explores the motion of fluids with both rotational and irrotational components, focusing on the boundary between these two types of motion and the determination of irrotational motion. The study uses equations and examples to demonstrate the relationship between vortex lines, magnetic matter, and the potential of the fluid.
