tldr: The author investigates the endophytic adaptation of the fungus Erysiphe graminis under cultural conditions. By infecting wounded host-plants, they observe the fungus's growth inwards through the intercellular spaces of the internal tissues, forming haustoria in mesophyll, sheath-cells of bundles, and lower epidermal cells. This endophytic adaptation allows the fungus to infect host-plants of different "biologic forms" and expand its range of attack.
