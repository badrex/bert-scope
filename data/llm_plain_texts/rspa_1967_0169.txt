tldr: The authors present the results of micrometeorite penetration measurements conducted by the Ariel II satellite. They found that the upper limits of the penetration rates of the aluminum foil sensors were lower by up to four orders of magnitude than the flux measured by microphone detectors. The authors discuss the possible reasons for this discrepancy and the implications for understanding the space environment and satellite technology.
