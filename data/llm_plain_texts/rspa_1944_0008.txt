tldr: This article explores the formation and shapes of artificial and natural pebbles through experiments and observations. The author creates marble pebbles by attrition and compares them to natural flint pebbles found in glacial gravel. The study focuses on the shapes of pebbles with approximate figures of revolution and how they are formed by abrasion with other pebbles in watercourses and on sea beaches. The author concludes that the artificial process represents the formation of natural pebbles, and the shapes of these pebbles can be better understood through further analysis of their geological processes.
