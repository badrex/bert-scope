tldr: The author investigates the blood changes in cholera patients and suggests using hypertonic saline transfusions to restore fluid balance and improve patient outcomes. The study shows a significant reduction in mortality rates when using hypertonic salt solutions compared to normal saline injections. This approach challenges the traditional methods of cholera treatment and offers a more effective way to manage the disease.
