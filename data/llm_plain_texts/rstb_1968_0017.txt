tldr: This study examines the functional morphology, ecology, habits, and feeding mechanisms of 22 species belonging to 15 genera of the family Chydoridae. The diverse habits and anatomical specializations allow these species to exploit various ecological niches. The research also reveals the importance of carapace specializations and the evolution of different ways of life and feeding mechanisms within the Chydoridae.
