tldr: The authors re-examined the comparative morphological organization of the prefrontal cortex in humans and rhesus monkeys, finding that the architectonic areas in both species correspond in terms of morphological features and topographical locations. They developed a common organizational schema for these areas, allowing for a resolution of previous discrepancies. Additionally, a connectional analysis revealed that each of the newly designated areas is characterized by a unique pattern of cortical relationships, providing a framework for interrelating findings from human brain imaging studies with those from behavioral investigations of non-human primates.
