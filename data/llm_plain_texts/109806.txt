tldr: The author, David Brewster, conducted experiments on the effects of temperature on glass and its impact on polarized light. He discovered that when glass is heated and then cooled, it can partially depolarize a ray of polarized light. Brewster also studied the properties of Prince Rupert's drops, which are formed by dropping melted glass into cold water, and found that they can be used to further study the effects of temperature on glass and its impact on light.
