tldr: The article presents a systematic formula for the asymptotic expansion of a general integral with respect to a small, positive parameter. The method uses integration in the finite part sense of Hadamard and applies to a wide range of complex functions and real functions. The results have various applications in mathematics, physics, and engineering.
