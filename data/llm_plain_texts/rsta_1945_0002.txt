tldr: The authors apply relaxation methods to study the elastic stability of plane frameworks and flat plating. They investigate critical loadings and associated modes of distortion for these structures, using techniques that can be applied to vibration problems as well. The methods are demonstrated through examples of frameworks and flat plating, providing insights into their stability and potential collapse.
