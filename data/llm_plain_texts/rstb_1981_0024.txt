tldr: The study explores a method to measure the dorsal surface of hominoid brain endocasts using a coordinate stereoplotter. The research reveals taxonomically different data in various cortical regions after correcting for overall endocast size. The method shows promise in depicting shape differences in functionally understood cortical regions through multivariate statistical analyses, providing valuable information for understanding the evolution of the hominid brain.
