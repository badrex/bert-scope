tldr: The authors developed a capillary method to determine the viscosity of molten salt mixtures, specifically the cadmium chloride-cadmium bromide system. They found that the viscosity isotherms are linear with the molar fraction of the mixture, and the activation energy of viscosity is higher than that of ionic migration. This study provides experimental data for the application of theories on molten salts and their mixtures.
