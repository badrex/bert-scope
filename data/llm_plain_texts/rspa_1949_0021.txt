tldr: This study investigates the influence of chlorine substitution on the oxidation rates of paraffin hydrocarbons. The authors found that chlorine substitution accelerates the oxidation process by impairing the symmetry of methyl groups and having a direct inductive effect. The results show that the rate of oxidation is strongly affected by the pressure of the organic reactant and is nearly independent of oxygen. The findings contribute to understanding the role of chlorine and methyl groups in hydrocarbon oxidation.
