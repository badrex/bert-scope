tldr: This article reviews the experimental evidence and theoretical predictions of the diffusion behavior of solutes in dilute solutions in supercritical fluids. It discusses the effects of concentration, temperature, and pressure on the diffusion coefficient and its anomalies in the critical region. The article also highlights the challenges in measuring diffusion coefficients in supercritical fluids and the various techniques used, such as Taylor dispersion, photon correlation spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance.
