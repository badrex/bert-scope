tldr: The authors studied the ultra-violet spectra and electron configurations of halide molecules, particularly focusing on HgF and related halides. They discovered that the ultra-violet spectra occur near resonance lines of the metal atom and analyzed the molecular states involved. This research provided insights into the nature of the molecular states and helped systematize the spectra of halides in the group.
