tldr: The author presents a general method in dynamics that reduces complex problems to the study of one central or "principal function." This method is applied to various scenarios, including problems of perturbation, and can be used to determine the integrals of equations of motion. The principal function is a key concept in understanding the behavior of a system in dynamics.
