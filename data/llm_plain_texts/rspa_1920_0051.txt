tldr: The authors studied moving striations in neon and helium gases using a rotating mirror and spectrum tubes. They found that the velocity of striations is roughly proportional to the inverse square root of the pressure and is greater in narrower tubes. The striations' appearance and behavior depend on the purity of the gas, pressure, and temperature. The phenomenon was not observed in monatomic gases like mercury vapor or diatomic gases like air and hydrogen.
