tldr: The authors develop a new method for calculating ionization potentials of conjugated molecules using molecular orbital theory. They propose a standard excited state approximation to obtain localized equivalent orbitals and apply this method to the molecules of pyridine and aniline. This approach can be used to calculate bond energies, resonance energies, and triplet state energies, providing a better understanding of molecular properties.
