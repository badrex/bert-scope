tldr: 'The authors describe a method to determine the attitude of the Ariel III satellite using solar reflexions from mirrors and solar cell panels. They explain how solar aspect sensors and glint observations from ground stations help in calculating the spin axis direction and coning angle of the satellite. The technique provides accurate results and eliminates the need for telemetry channels for solar aspect data transmission.'
