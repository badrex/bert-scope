tldr: The article investigates the fluid motion through a branching tube, focusing on the steady laminar flow of an incompressible fluid in a straight pipe that bifurcates into two semi-circular pipes. The study aims to discover the dynamical attributes of the three-dimensionality of the bifurcation and analyze the initial development of the induced pressure gradient and secondary flow. The research provides insight into the long-scale flow and its structure, which implies a strong favorable pressure gradient and substantial rise in velocities and stresses near the sidewalls.
