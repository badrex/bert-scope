tldr: The author, Smart Lethieullier, shares an account of the burning of Danbury Steeple by lightning and the earthquake that occurred around the same time. He describes the events, their impact, and the lack of connection between the two incidents. The Steeple was consumed by fire after a violent storm, while the earthquake was felt by some residents but not by the author himself.
