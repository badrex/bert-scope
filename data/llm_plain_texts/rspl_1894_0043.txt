tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the elasticity of the living brain and tested the relationship between brain elasticity and blood pressure. They found that there is no constant relation between brain elasticity and blood pressure, and that the elasticity of the brain is not dependent on central arterial pressure. The study also showed that an increase in venous pressure can help restore the volume of the brain after compression.
