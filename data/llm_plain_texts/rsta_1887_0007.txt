tldr: This article investigates the distribution of strain in the Earth's crust resulting from secular cooling, which affects the growth of continents and the formation of mountain chains. The author uses the research of Sir W. Thomson and Professor G. H. Darwin on the rigidity of the Earth and its cooling to determine the effects of this strain on the Earth's surface features.
