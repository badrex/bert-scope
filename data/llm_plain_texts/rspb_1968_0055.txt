tldr: The author discusses the concept of cryptobiosis, a state in which an organism's metabolic activity comes to a reversible standstill, and its potential significance in understanding the origins and distribution of life. Cryptobiotic organisms can survive extreme conditions and have increased life-spans, but damage sustained during this state is cumulative. The author also explores the potential implications of cryptobiosis for space travel and the possibility of humans undergoing suspended animation.
