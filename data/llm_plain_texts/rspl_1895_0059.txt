tldr: This article examines the different types of granular leucocytes and their development. The author classifies leucocytes into three main groups based on the presence or absence of granules and discusses their structure, function, and relationship to other cells. The study concludes that granules in leucocytes are part of the cytomitoma and are involved in amoeboid movement, rather than being products of metabolic activity.
