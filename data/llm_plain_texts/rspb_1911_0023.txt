tldr: This article investigates the physical and physiological properties of stovaine and its homologues, focusing on their densities, affinity values, and effects on contractility of isolated muscle, blood pressure, and respiration. The study finds that the substitution of the ethyl grouping in stovaine with other groupings produces a decrease in the rate of action, and that these compounds have similar and approximately equal effects on the circulation and respiration, with amyl stovaine being more potent as a local anesthetic.
