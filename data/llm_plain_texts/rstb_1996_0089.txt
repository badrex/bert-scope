tldr: This article discusses the challenges in defining and studying cephalopod populations, which are essential components of marine ecosystems. Cephalopods have unique life cycle characteristics, such as early reproduction, rapid growth, and short lifespans, that contribute to their population instability. Their wide-ranging migrations and sensitivity to environmental variables make predicting their distribution and density difficult. The article highlights the importance of understanding cephalopod populations for assessing the impact of ecological perturbations and human activities on marine ecosystems.
