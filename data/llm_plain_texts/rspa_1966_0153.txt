tldr: This article explores one-dimensional shock waves in materials that do not conduct heat and have long-range, non-linear viscoelastic memory. The authors generalize the classical theory of Hugoniot curves to substances with memory, showing that the jump in entropy across a shock wave of small intensity is of order three or higher in the jump in strain. The theorems of Bethe and Weyl on shocks of arbitrary intensity can also be generalized to materials with memory.
