tldr: The author, William Hyde Wollaston, developed a method to examine refractive and dispersive powers using prismatic reflection. This method allows for the measurement of refractive powers without the need for two surfaces inclined towards each other, making it possible to determine the refractive powers of opaque bodies. The author also demonstrated how this method can be applied to media with varying densities, such as the crystalline lens in animal eyes. Additionally, Wollaston explored the dispersion of light and the reversal of prismatic colors in certain media.
