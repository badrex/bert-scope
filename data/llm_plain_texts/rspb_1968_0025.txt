tldr: The article discusses the common cytochemical and ultrastructural characteristics of cells that produce polypeptide hormones, which are part of the APUD series. These cells share five main characteristics, including high a-GPD, high non-specific esterase or cholinesterase, fluorogenic amine content, amine-precursor uptake, and amino acid decarboxylase. The study also highlights the relevance of these cells to thyroid and ultimobranchial C cells and the hormone calcitonin.
