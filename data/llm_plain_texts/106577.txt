tldr: 'In this meteorological journal, John Atkins recorded weather observations from Minehead, Somersetshire, in 1782. He used a barometer, thermometer, and hygrometer to measure atmospheric conditions. Atkins noted a significant difference in the barometer and thermometer readings compared to previous years, as well as an unusual phenomenon of a halo appearing like the sun with snow fields at its ends.'
