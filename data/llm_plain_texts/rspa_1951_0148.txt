  - Stokes's Theorem
tldr: The author discusses the errors that may occur when calculating the elevation of the geoid using Stokes's formula when gravity data outside a given cap are neglected. The paper shows that these errors are comparable to the root-mean-square elevation and are not significantly affected by assumptions about the distribution of gravity anomalies between harmonics up to degree 18. The author also estimates the errors in calculated differences of elevation at neighboring stations.
