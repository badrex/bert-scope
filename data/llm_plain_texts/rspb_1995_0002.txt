tldr: The authors analyzed the DNA sequences of protamine P1 genes and flanking regions from 21 mammalian species, including representatives of all extant marsupial orders. They found that marsupial protamines are distinct from those of eutherian mammals due to the lack of cysteine residues. The phylogenetic analysis led to conclusions about the relationships between various marsupial lineages, such as the microbiothere Dromiciops being part of a clad that includes dasyurids, Notoryctes, and diprotodontians but not bandicoots.
