tldr: This study investigates intumescences and wound-callus in various plants, examining the effects of temperature, illumination, and nutritive solutions on their formation. The author concludes that moist air, heat, light, and oxygen are necessary external factors, while internal factors such as irritability and assimilation play a role. The nuclear phenomena in intumescences and wound-callus are found to be similar to those in pathological tissues of plants and animals.
