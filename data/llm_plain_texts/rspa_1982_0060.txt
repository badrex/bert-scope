tldr: The authors study the genericity of caustics formed by reflection in a mirror, focusing on the local aspect of source genericity. They consider transversality to strata of corank 2 and 1 of codimension 2. The key idea is to reduce the problem to studying the contact of a quadric of revolution with the mirror. The results show that certain types of mirrors, such as those with bad umbilics or surfaces of revolution, provide counterexamples to source genericity.
