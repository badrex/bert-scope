tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the brains of monkeys to study the localization of functions and movements in the brain. They used electrical stimulation to observe the effects on the monkeys' limbs and movements. The results showed that specific areas of the brain control different movements, such as walking and prehension, and that these areas can be compared to the human brain's convolutions.
