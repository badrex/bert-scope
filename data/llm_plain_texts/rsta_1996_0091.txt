tldr: The article explores the problem of frustration in cellular structures and presents two methods to build and decurve them. The first method involves decurving progressively and at random a cellular structure initially ordered in curved space, while the second method builds the structure layer by layer from an arbitrary seed cell. The authors analyze the energy of the structures and discuss the role of configurational entropy in building up a froth with different local topological configurations.
