tldr: 'Hideki Yukawa, a Japanese physicist, revolutionized the field of nuclear physics with his groundbreaking work on meson theory. In 1935, Yukawa proposed a new particle that acted as the agent of nuclear forces, predicting its properties with remarkable accuracy. His work paved the way for the understanding of nuclear forces and the development of modern particle physics. Despite initial challenges and confusion, Yukawa's ideas eventually led to significant advancements in the field, and he is considered a pioneer in nuclear and particle physics.'
