tldr: In this letter, Martin Lister discusses his observations of vegetable excrescencies and the insects that develop within them. He examines various types of excrescencies and their relationship with insects, questioning whether they are generated by the plants themselves or by the insects. Lister also explores different ways insects feed on plants and the role of insects in plant reproduction.
