tldr: The authors investigated nitrogen uptake and storage in the bacterium Paracoccus denitrificans. They discovered that the bacterium stores nitrogen in the form of water-soluble complexes containing adenine and guanine. When the available nitrogen in the culture medium is depleted, these complexes break down, allowing the bacterium to continue growing. This research provides insights into the nitrogen storage mechanisms in bacteria and the role of purines in this process.
