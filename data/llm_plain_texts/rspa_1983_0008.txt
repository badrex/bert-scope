tldr: The authors developed a non-destructive testing method to detect and measure cracks in threaded bolts made of titanium and Inconel alloys. They used an alternating current potential difference method that measures the perturbations in the surface voltage distribution caused by the crack presence. The method provides information about the size and geometry of the crack, and it can be useful for evaluating industrial threaded fasteners.
