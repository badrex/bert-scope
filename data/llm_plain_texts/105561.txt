tldr: The author presents concise rules for calculating the effects of refraction and parallax on the apparent distance of the Moon and stars. These rules help in determining the longitude of a ship at sea by observing the Moon's distance from the Sun or fixed stars. The rules are based on the hypothesis that refraction in altitude is proportional to the tangent of the zenith distance. The author also provides a second rule for calculating a smaller correction on the observed distance of the Moon from a star due to parallax.
