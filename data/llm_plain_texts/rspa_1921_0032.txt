tldr: The authors developed a method to analyze galvanometer records in thermal experiments. They used a control curve to determine the course of heat production in a substance. The method involves subtracting the control curve from the observed curve to obtain the heat production at specific intervals. This technique can be applied to various cases where a sudden outburst of heat can be provided at a definite moment.
