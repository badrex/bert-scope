tldr: The author discusses the complex gene regulation system in Streptomyces, a type of soil bacteria, which controls their morphological and physiological differentiation, including sporulation and antibiotic production. The study focuses on the model system Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) and reveals a regulatory cascade operating at several levels. This understanding of gene switching can help in the development of antibiotics and other secondary metabolites.
