tldr: The authors present a new unified procedure for constructing continuum theories of deformable media, starting with the balance of energy. This procedure derives all the relevant balance laws, including those associated with thermal, electrical, and magnetic effects. The authors illustrate the basic features of this procedure in the context of classical thermomechanics and discuss two generalizations: one in the presence of an additional kinematic variable and another in the presence of full electromagnetic effects.
