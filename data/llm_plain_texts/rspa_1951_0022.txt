tldr: The authors present a theory of the nuclear hyperfine structure of paramagnetic resonance spectra in crystals, focusing on the iron transition group. They discuss the importance of the crystalline electric field, spin-orbit coupling, external magnetic field, and nuclear interactions in determining the hyperfine structure. The theory is essential for understanding the behavior of paramagnetic substances and their applications in various fields.
