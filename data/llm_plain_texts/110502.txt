tldr: The author conducted an experiment during the annular eclipse of May 15, 1836, to determine if the sun's atmosphere was responsible for the phenomenon of dark lines in the solar spectrum. The experiment showed no differences in the spectrum when light came from different parts of the solar disc, proving that the sun's atmosphere is not involved in the production of this phenomenon.
