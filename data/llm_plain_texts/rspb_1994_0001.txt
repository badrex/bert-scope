tldr: Researchers studied the stalk-eyed fly, Cyrtodiopsis dalmanni, to understand the relationship between female mate choice and exaggerated male traits. They found a genetic correlation between male eye span and female preferences, demonstrating that female flies preferred males with longer eye spans. Additionally, the study found that mate choice did not affect female survival or fecundity, suggesting that female selectivity is inversely related to mate choice costs.
