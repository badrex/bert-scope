tldr: This article investigates the cell structure of Cyanophyceae, a group of plants resembling algae. The author examines the central body, cytoplasm, and coloration of these organisms, concluding that the central body is a rudimentary nucleus and the coloration is due to chlorophyll and anthocyan granules in the cytoplasm. The study provides a better understanding of the relationship between Cyanophyceae and other plant groups.
