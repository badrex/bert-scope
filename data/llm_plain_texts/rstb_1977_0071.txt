tldr: This article discusses the research on Antarctic marine secondary production and the phenomenon of cold adaptation. It examines the growth rates, feeding patterns, and metabolic rates of various crustaceans and fish species in the Antarctic nearshore environment. The study compares the growth rates of these species with those from temperate and tropical regions, highlighting the slow growth rates of most Antarctic species due to cold adaptation. The article also explores the differences in growth rates and metabolic rates between species and groups, and the impact of environmental temperature on these factors.
