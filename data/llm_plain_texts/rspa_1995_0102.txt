tldr: The authors present a theoretical method to determine the striking distance of lightning to earthed structures based on leader current and ionization processes. They show that the striking distance is dependent on the lightning conductor's height and peak current, and that it increases significantly with altitude, leading to a higher risk of lightning strikes in mountainous or aviation environments.
