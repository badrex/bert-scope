tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate if synthetic polycyclic hydrocarbons could induce the formation of secondary neural tubes in amphibians. They found that substances like 1:9-dimethylphenanthrene, 9:10-dihydroxy-9:10-di-β-β-butyl-9:10-dihydro-1:2:5:6-dibenzanthracene, and 1:2:5:6-dibenzanthracene were capable of evocation, confirming that certain ether-soluble, unsaponifiable substances have the power to induce neural tube formation. This study adds to the understanding of the role of synthetic hydrocarbons in amphibian development and their potential connection to tumour formation and regeneration.
