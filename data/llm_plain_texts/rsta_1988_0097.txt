tldr: The author presents a global simulation approach to complex systems using a parallel supercomputer. They focus on the study of water as an example, starting with building molecules from nuclei and electrons using quantum mechanics. They then use Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics to study the motions of water molecules and collective properties, and extend the simulation to fluid dynamics. The author emphasizes the importance of using supercomputers for complex simulations and discusses the implications of the global simulation methodology and supercomputers' evolution in terms of productivity of information.
