tldr: The authors investigate the role of hydrogen bonds in condensed monolayers, particularly in compounds containing the CO.NH linkage. They find that hydrogen bonds play a significant role in determining the properties of condensed monolayers, leading to condensation and solidification. The study also highlights the importance of hydrogen bonds in understanding protein structure and behavior.
