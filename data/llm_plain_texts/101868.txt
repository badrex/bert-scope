tldr: The author describes the discovery of an ancient sepulchre in Cocherel, France, containing the remains of about twenty men. The sepulchre was built with large, rough stones and contained various artifacts, including flint tools, axes, and other stone objects. The author also notes the presence of bones that had been sharpened, possibly for use as weapons or tools. The burial site also contained ashes and burnt bones, suggesting that some individuals were cremated. The author speculates that these burial practices may have been used by a barbarian nation that invaded the Gauls.
