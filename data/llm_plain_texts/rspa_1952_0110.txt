tldr: The authors study the effect of Coriolis perturbations on the infra-red bands of symmetric top molecules. They show that the sum of Coriolis coefficients for vibrations in any symmetry class assumes a simple form and provide a method for calculating first-order Coriolis coefficients. This research helps in understanding the interaction between vibration and rotation in molecules and interpreting their spectra.
