tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the influence of temperature on the Brownian movement of a galvanometer coil. They found that the mean value of the movement is affected by the temperature of the galvanometer system, and developed a theoretical method to calculate the Brownian movement in a system with two different temperatures. This work helps to understand the behavior of particles in a liquid and has implications for the study of thermodynamics and electromotive forces.
