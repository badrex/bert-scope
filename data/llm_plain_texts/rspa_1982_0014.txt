tldr: This article studies the nonlinear interactions between shock waves and laminar boundary layers in supersonic flow. The author uses a series expansion method to analyze the pressure and skin-friction in the flow, confirming previous numerical solutions and extending the understanding of upstream influence in boundary layer separation. The findings have implications for the design of aircraft and other high-speed vehicles.
