tldr: The author conducted experiments on Daphnia pulex and Moina rectirostris to study the effects of isolation and temperature on the production of sexual forms in Cladocera. They found that isolation and high temperature can suppress the production of sexual forms, while crowding and lower temperatures can increase their production. The results suggest that there is an internal factor, such as a substance or cycle, that influences the production of sexual forms in each species of Cladocera.
