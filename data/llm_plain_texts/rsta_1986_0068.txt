tldr: This article explores the use of electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) to study the adsorption of ethylene on metal surfaces. EELS provides a powerful method for determining the structures of chemisorbed species and can be used to understand catalysis, corrosion, and oxidation processes. The authors demonstrate how EELS can identify different species formed by ethylene adsorption on various crystal faces and discuss the selection rules and symmetries associated with adsorbed monolayers.
