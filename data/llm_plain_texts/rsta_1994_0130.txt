tldr: This article discusses recent findings from the Galileo and Ulysses spacecraft regarding the magnetic field of the solar system, particularly focusing on Jupiter's magnetic field. The authors analyze the radial component of the field and its relation to planetary rotation, as well as the implications of these findings for our understanding of the solar system's transport and field line behavior.
