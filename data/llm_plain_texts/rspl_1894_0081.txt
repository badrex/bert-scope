tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the electrification of air and its behavior. They found that air can be easily electrified and that it retains negative electrification longer than positive. The experiments also showed that dust in the air does not affect the electrification process, and that electrification is not caused by the dropping of water through purified air.
