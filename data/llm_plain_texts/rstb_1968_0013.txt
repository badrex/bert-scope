tldr: The authors studied the genetics of the mimetic butterfly Papilio memnon, discovering that seventeen female forms are controlled by a series of at least eleven autosomal alleles at one locus. The genetic control of polymorphism in P. memnon shows remarkable parallels with that in P. dardanus, providing further evidence for the gradual evolution of mimicry through the accumulation of closely linked allelomorphs in advantageous combinations.
