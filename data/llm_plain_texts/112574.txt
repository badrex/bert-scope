revised_title: Radiation and Absorption: The Influence of Chemical Composition and Temperature
semantic_tags:
  - Thermal radiation
  - Absorption
  - Blackbody radiation
  - Heat transfer
  - Chemical composition
tldr: The author, J. Tyndall, investigates the behavior of various elementary bodies in relation to radiant heat. He examines the effects of chemical composition on the absorption and emission of heat in powders and liquids. Contrary to common belief, Tyndall finds that chemical composition significantly affects the radiative power of substances in powdered form. He also demonstrates the reciprocity of radiation and absorption in fine powders and shows that heat emitted from different sources varies in quality.
