tldr: 'Thomas Andrew Knight's experiments demonstrate the importance of leaves in plant growth, development, and fruit ripening. He shows that a fluid similar to the true sap descends through the leaf-stalks and that the growth of immature leaves depends on matter provided by mature leaves. Knight also observes that fruit growth relies on mature leaves, and trees that retain their leaves during winter can ripen fruit during that season.'
