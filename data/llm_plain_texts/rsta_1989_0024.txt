tldr: This article discusses observations of solar-wind-magnetosphere coupling at the Earth's magnetopause. The Active Magnetospheric Particle Tracer Explorers dataset is used to study the signatures of reconnection, which is thought to be the main process responsible for coupling the solar wind to the terrestrial magnetosphere. The article reviews advances made in this area of research and discusses recent developments in the theory of time-independent and time-dependent reconnection. Two data examples from the International Sun-Earth Explorer mission are revisited and interpreted in light of these newer developments.
