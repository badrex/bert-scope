tldr: The authors investigate the detection of submicroscopic lattice defects in aluminium using a vacancy supersaturation technique. They study the conditions under which defects can be revealed due to the precipitation of vacant lattice sites from a supersaturated solution. The authors describe the conditions for the optimum visibility of defects and analyze the effect of deformation in such a situation. The results show that the rows of dislocation loops and narrow faulted dislocation dipoles in aluminium are formed as a consequence of the enhanced local vacancy concentration produced by the motion of sessile jogs on dislocations.
