tldr: This study investigates the respiration of ripening apples during their senescent phase. The research explores the intensity and course of respiration in individual apples and how it is affected by environmental factors such as temperature and CO2 production. The findings contribute to understanding the relationship between respiration and the overall vitality of plant cells during different stages of development, maturity, and senescence.
