tldr: This article presents observations and theoretical studies of high-frequency internal waves in Lake Geneva. The waves were generated after the passing of disturbances that caused a rapid increase in the thermocline depth. Three possible mechanisms for the source of the internal waves are proposed and compared with available data. The investigation of these mechanisms involves the study of wave patterns in the observed current distribution and stratification of the lake, as well as the derivation of an expression for the energy of internal waves propagating in a shear flow.
