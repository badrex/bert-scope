tldr: This article discusses the crystal structures and properties of mixed crystals of phenazine and N-oxyphenazine. The authors refine the crystal structures and explore the variation of physical properties with changing composition. The study provides insights into the short-range-order diffuse scattering and the behavior of mixed crystals in organic chemistry.
