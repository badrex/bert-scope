tldr: 'This article describes experiments conducted using an aeroplane to measure cosmic rays and study the production of showers at high altitudes. The authors used coincidence counter measurements to analyze the effects of altitude on cosmic rays and found that the radiation becomes softer at higher altitudes. They also observed that large showers increase with altitude faster than small showers. This research provides valuable insights into the behavior of cosmic rays and their interactions with the Earth's atmosphere.'
