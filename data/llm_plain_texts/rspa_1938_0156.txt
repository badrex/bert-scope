tldr: This article explores the electrical conductivity of transition metals and how it is affected by temperature. The author proposes a model to explain the behavior of these metals, focusing on the s-d transitions and their impact on conductivity. The study shows that at high temperatures, s-d transitions dominate, while at low temperatures, the resistance is due to normal s-s and d-d transitions.
