tldr: This article discusses the role of bacterial and viral toxins in causing damage to the host during infection. It explores the different levels of tissue damage, including damage to mucosal epithelial surfaces, subepithelial focus of infection, and tissues and organs distant from the infection site. The article also highlights the mechanisms of tissue damage and the importance of understanding these mechanisms for developing new preventative measures against diseases.
