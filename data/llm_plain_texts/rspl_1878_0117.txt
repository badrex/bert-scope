tldr: This article discusses the authors' research on the inequalities of the diurnal range of the declination magnet at Kew Observatory. They found strong evidence of an inequality with a period of 24-00 days and preliminary evidence of two other inequalities with periods close to 24-65 and 24-80 days. Additionally, the article presents experiments on metallic reflection, specifically the reflection of light by polished metallic surfaces in contact with different media.
