tldr: The authors discovered new forms of visual purple in sea fishes with varying absorption curves. They found that deep-water fishes receive weak illumination and have a predominance of rods in their retinae. The study aimed to find a correlation between the type of visual purple and the histological structure of the retina, but the attempt was not successful. The research provides important insights into the light-sensitive substances in the retina and their role in color perception.
