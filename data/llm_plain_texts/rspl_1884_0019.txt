tldr: The author investigates serum albumin and its differentiation through a process called fractional heat-coagulation. They discovered that serum albumin can be separated into three different proteids with distinct heat-coagulation temperatures. The author also found that certain salts, such as sodium sulfate, can be used to precipitate serum albumin and differentiate it from serum globulin.
