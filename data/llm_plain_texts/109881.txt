tldr: 'Sir Everard Home discovered the ovum in the human uterus, providing insights into ovum formation and impregnation. He disproved the notion that the corpus luteum is the effect of impregnation and showed it to be a glandular structure where the ovum is formed. The study also revealed that ova pass into the uterus during the state of virginity and that impregnation can occur even without the presence of the male.'
