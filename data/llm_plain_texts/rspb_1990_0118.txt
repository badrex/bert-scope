tldr: 'The study found that in the marine mussel Mytilus, there is a high frequency of individuals with more than one mitochondrial DNA genome, with the majority possessing two genomes, F and M. The F genome is more common in females, while the M genome is more common in males. This sex-biased heteroplasmy could be due to factors such as replicative advantage, mutation rates, and somatic segregation.'
