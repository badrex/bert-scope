tldr: 'J. Clerk Maxwell proposed a theory of the electromagnetic field, explaining that electromagnetic phenomena are produced by actions in the surrounding medium rather than direct forces acting at a distance. He introduced the concept of an ethereal medium, capable of storing and transmitting energy, and described the electromagnetic field as a part of space containing electric or magnetic bodies. Maxwell's theory includes the principles of electromagnetic induction, and it laid the foundation for modern electromagnetism and the development of electromagnetic theory.'
