tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate the distribution of electric force and potential gradient in glow discharges from a point to a plane. They discovered that the striated glow discharge is of an intermittent character and explained the oscillatory behavior of the discharges. The findings provide insights into the understanding of electric force and potential gradient in glow discharges.
