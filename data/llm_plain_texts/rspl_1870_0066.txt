tldr: This article discusses the increase of electrical resistance in conductors with rising temperature and presents a simple method for measuring electrical resistances. The author, Charles William Siemens, also introduces an electrical pyrometer that can measure both ordinary and furnace temperatures, providing a thermometric scale that covers a wide range of temperatures.
