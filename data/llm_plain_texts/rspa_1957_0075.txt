tldr: The authors describe an experimental setup that demonstrates a centripetal-pump effect in air, where a rotating hollow cylinder pumps air through a gap between the cylinder wall and a heavy oil. This phenomenon is explained by a stress-strain relation in which the strain is defined in Hencky's logarithmic measure, confirming that air is an elasticoviscous material with an elastic shear modulus and a finite time of relaxation. A rheological equation for air is proposed.
