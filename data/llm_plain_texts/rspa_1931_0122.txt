tldr: This article presents experiments on electron emission from Langmuir probes and glow discharge cathodes. The authors measure the positive ion and electron currents at the surface of a negatively charged Langmuir probe in various gases. They discuss the results from the perspective of the glow discharge and find that electron emission increases with the potential, which is important for understanding the behavior of gases in electrical discharges.
