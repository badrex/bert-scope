tldr: The authors present a theory of monocular depth determination using optical flow by incorporating finite temporal resolution in space-time signal processing. They propose a new operator that combines spatial and temporal information to detect edges and infer depth, providing a mechanism for depth perception in computer vision systems and potentially modeling depth perception in humans.
