tldr: The author, Humphry Davy, conducted experiments on a new detonating substance, analyzing its composition and properties. He discovered that the substance, when exposed to certain chemicals, could detonate or produce various elements such as azote, chlorine, and ammonia. Davy also discussed the importance of the law of definite proportions and the limitations of using analogy in predicting chemical combinations.
