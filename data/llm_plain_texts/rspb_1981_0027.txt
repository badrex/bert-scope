tldr: The article studies the eye structure and function of Orchomene sp. cf. O. rossi, an amphipod living under the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica. The species has orange-colored eyes with 360 ommatidia, and their eyes are relatively large and transparent. The study provides insights into the dioptric apparatus, retinula cells, and rhabdom organization of these unique eyes, which help the amphipods adapt to the low-light environment under the ice shelf.
