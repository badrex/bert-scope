tldr: The authors discuss the role of acetate in fatty-acid synthesis in lactating mammary glands. They explore enzyme systems and the synthesis of fatty acids in cell-free preparations from rat and sheep mammary glands. The study reveals that the synthesis of fatty acids in these preparations occurs through the condensation of acetate units and requires co-factors such as DPN and CoA. The research also highlights the importance of oxidizable substrates and the potential for further understanding of fatty-acid synthesis in mammary glands.
