tldr: This study investigates the non-impulsive stretch-receptor complex of the crab, focusing on the interaction between the stretch-receptor T-fibre and the motoneurons it connects. The researchers found that depolarization-release coupling in the T-fibre has similar properties to the squid giant synapse, but the crab synapses transmit prolonged, graded depolarizations, which are decrementally conducted from the periphery. This preparation offers a new way to study synaptic physiology and sensorimotor systems.
