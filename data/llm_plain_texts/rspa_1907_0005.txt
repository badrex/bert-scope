tldr: The author investigates the relationship between breaking stress and extension in tensile tests of steel. They find that the sum of breaking stress and elongation percentage remains constant for all mild steels, regardless of heat treatment, and is approximately 68. This constant sum indicates the intrinsic strength of the material, which is not affected by heat treatment and can be used as a quality test for steel.
