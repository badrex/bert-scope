tldr: This study investigates the elastohydrodynamic behavior of polyphenyl ether in lubrication, focusing on film thickness and traction. The results show that the film thickness is well below the theoretical value and is sensitive to temperature. The traction behavior of polyphenyl ether is more complex than that of mineral oils, which is thought to be due to the variation of pressure distribution with speed and load. The fluid behaves elastically when the slip is small, even at the lowest load, and above a critical stress, the relation between shear stress and rate of shear becomes non-linear, making the non-Newtonian characteristics similar to a 'viscous' fluid.
