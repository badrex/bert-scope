tldr: In December 1755, a series of earthquakes shook the frontiers of Europe, causing some panic but no major damage. The author, Mons. Allemond, reported that the earthquakes were felt in cities like Liege, Maestricht, Nimeguen, and Arnheim. He also mentioned that salt springs in Bevieux, Switzerland, became more salty due to the earthquakes. A similar event occurred in Amersfort, Utrecht, in January 1755.
