tldr: The authors analyzed the spatial distribution and intensity of radio stars, finding that they cannot be explained by a homogeneous distribution of sources. Instead, there is an apparent increase in the spatial density or absolute luminosity of distant sources, suggesting a cosmological effect. This discovery supports the possibility of explaining the observations in terms of an evolutionary theory rather than steady-state theories.
