tldr: 'The article explains the concept of "genetic colonization" where Agrobacterium tumefaciens transfers specific genetic information to plants, causing them to express new traits like uncontrolled growth and opine synthesis. The bacteria benefit from this transformation as they can use the opines for their growth and proliferation. This phenomenon represents a new type of parasitism, where the parasite introduces genetic information into the host, forcing it to produce compounds that only the parasite can utilize.'
