tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the influence of physical agents, such as light and temperature, on the development of tadpoles of the Triton and the Frog. The results showed that tadpoles can develop in the absence of light, but their development is affected by temperature. The author also studied the respiration and nutrition of tadpoles, discovering that they require both the gelatin of the ova and plants growing in the water for proper growth.
