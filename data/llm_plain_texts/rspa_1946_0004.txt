tldr: The authors present a theoretical study of the transverse flexure of perforated aeolotropic plates, focusing on circular and elliptical holes. They develop a general solution for the transverse displacement and analyze stress couples and shearing forces in various cases, providing numerical results for a spruce plate. The study extends previous work on isotropic materials to aeolotropic plates, offering insights into the behavior of perforated plates under different conditions.
