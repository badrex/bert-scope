tldr: The authors studied the molecular structure and anisotropy of sorbic acid, a compound with an open conjugated chain. They found that the monoclinic unit cell contains eight molecules, linked by hydrogen bonds. The molecular chains are inclined at an angle to the crystal axes, and the authors confirmed the orientation of the molecules using Laue photographs. The study provides insights into the structure and properties of sorbic acid, which is important for understanding its potential applications, such as in the production of artificial rubber.
