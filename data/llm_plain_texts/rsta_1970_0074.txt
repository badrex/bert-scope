tldr: The author developed a method of time series analysis based on discrete Fourier transforms to detect and estimate lunar and solar magnetic variations in the geomagnetic field. The method provides estimates of the amplitudes of sinusoidal variations in the data, which are not affected by noise. The author applied this method to Abinger declination records from 1927 to 1956, identifying prominent solar and lunar peaks in the amplitude spectrum.
