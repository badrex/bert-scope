tldr: This study investigates the variation of mobility of gaseous ions, specifically caesium and sodium ions, in helium with temperature. The mobility of caesium ions at constant density reaches a maximum value, while sodium ions suggest a similar maximum at higher temperatures. The results support classical theories of Langevin and Hasse and Cook, with improvements suggested for the repulsive field term.
