tldr: This study examines the reactions of traces of heavy water, deuterium, and carbon dioxide added to rich hydrogen-nitrogen-oxygen flames. The researchers found that the overall reactions and controlling rate constants for the flames with and without additives are now sufficiently established to compute detailed flame profiles. By comparing these profiles with experimental data, they deduced information about the reactions and their rate constants, which can help improve our understanding of flame chemistry.
