  - Crystal structure
  - Hardness
  - Residual stress
tldr: The authors studied the effects of current density and temperature on the structure and properties of electro-deposited chromium. They found that deposits with a (111) preferred orientation had the highest hardness and lowest residual stress. The structure and properties of the deposits were affected by the conditions of deposition, such as temperature and current density.
