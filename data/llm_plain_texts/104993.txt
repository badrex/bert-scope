tldr: The Abbe Mazeas and Count Caylus revived an ancient method of painting using burnt wax, known as encaustic painting. They discovered a simple technique of applying colors to wax, which made the paintings durable and resistant to environmental factors. This method was admired for its unique properties, such as the ability to maintain clarity in various lighting conditions and resist damage from smoke and vapors.
