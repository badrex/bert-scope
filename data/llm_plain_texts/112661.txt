tldr: The author, William Ladd, received a small magneto-electric machine and sought to improve its design for increased power. He made modifications to the machine, including adding a second wire and a Siemens's armature, which allowed for a stronger current and the potential for external work. This innovation could be used for blasting or other purposes, and even with a rudimentary machine, it was able to make three inches of platinum wire incandescent.
