tldr: 'In 1769, Owen Biddle and Joel Bayley observed the transit of Venus over the Sun from Lewestown, Pennsylvania. Their observations helped determine the distance between the Earth and Venus and contributed to the understanding of celestial mechanics. They used a theodolite and a reflecting telescope to accurately measure the positions of the Sun and Venus during the transit.'
