tldr: The authors studied the structure of the violet bands of silicon nitride using a high-resolution spectrograph. They found that the bands' structure is consistent with a specific type of electronic transition and confirmed that vibrational quantum numbers hold integral values. The study provides further evidence for the quantum mechanics formulation and contributes to the understanding of the vibrational energy terms and their effect on rotational terms in molecules.
