tldr: 'The author, W. B. Huff, conducted an experiment to determine the electrostatic deviation of beta-rays from radio-tellurium under the guidance of Professor J. J. Thomson. They used a beam of beta-rays passing between charged plates and a glass plate coated with zinc sulphide to detect the position of the beam. The results showed that the deviation of beta-rays from radio-tellurium was less than that of radium. The experiment faced challenges with accurate settings and long exposure times for photographic plates.'
