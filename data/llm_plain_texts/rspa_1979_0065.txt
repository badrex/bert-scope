semantic_tags:
  - X-ray astronomy
  - Seyfert galaxies
  - Active galactic nuclei
  - Extragalactic X-ray sources
  - Radio properties
tldr: This article discusses the properties of compact extragalactic X-ray sources, specifically focusing on type 1 Seyfert galaxies and galaxies with active nuclei and relatively sharp emission lines. The author reviews their radio and optical properties, electromagnetic spectra, and the relation between their various nuclear components. The article also explores the spatial scales of the materials emitting in different wavebands and their possible connections to the thermal gas responsible for optical emission lines.
