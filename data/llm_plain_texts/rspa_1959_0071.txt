tldr: 'The authors studied the atomization of hydrogen on a tungsten surface at various temperatures and pressures. They found that at higher temperatures, almost every molecule striking the surface is atomized, and the rate is controlled by the availability of molecules for reaction. The energy of activation for the atomization process was determined, and the calculated coverages were provided in a table.'
