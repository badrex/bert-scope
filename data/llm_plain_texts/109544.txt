tldr: 'Charles Hatchett analyzed a mineral substance from North America and discovered a new metallic element, which he named Columbium. The element was found to be different from other known metals due to its limited extent of oxidation. It has potential uses in pigments, as it produces fine colors that do not fade when exposed to light and air.'
