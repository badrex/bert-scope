tldr: The author, Julius Plucker, investigates the magnetic induction in crystals and proposes a new hypothesis involving ellipsoids to explain the magnetic behavior of uniaxal and biaxial crystals. This hypothesis connects the magnetic properties of crystals with the optical properties, suggesting that both are influenced by the crystalline structure.
