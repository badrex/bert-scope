tldr: The authors investigate the hydration of simple ions and polyions by examining salting-out behavior in relation to dielectric saturation effects and partial molal volumes of polysalts. They propose a new theory that calculates the salting-out behavior over two regions: the primary hydration shell where solvent dielectric saturation prevails, and beyond the primary region where weaker polarization occurs. This theory is applied to experimental data on the salting-out of non-electrolytes and partial molal volume measurements of polyions and corresponding monomer salts.
