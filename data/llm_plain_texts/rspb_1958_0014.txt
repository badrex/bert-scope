tldr: 'The study investigates the growth of the tibialis anterior muscle in normal rabbits and its relation to the tension-length ratio. The research finds that the growth rate of the muscle belly is more rapid than the increase in the distance it shortens, leading to a smaller proportion of maximum tension in young rabbits compared to adults. The findings provide insights into muscle growth and its functional significance.'
