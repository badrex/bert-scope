tldr: This study investigates the effects of selection and migration on the geotactic and phototactic behavior of Drosophila pseudoobscura. The researchers found that populations subjected to artificial selection became positively or negatively phototactic or geotactic. When selection was discontinued, populations showed genetic homeostasis, gradually converging to similar behaviors. Additionally, when positive and negative populations exchanged migrants, they converged towards identical behaviors, but the points of convergence were influenced by genetic homeostasis. The study's findings suggest that genetic homeostasis plays a crucial role in shaping the behavior of populations and can counteract the effects of selection.
