tldr: This article explores the role of nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis in transducing systems, comparing the mechanisms of actomyosin in muscle and the ras system. The study investigates how the energy of nucleotide hydrolysis drives protein-protein interactions and cycles of activation and deactivation in biological processes. The chemical mechanisms of hydrolysis and phosphate-water oxygen exchange are examined to understand the coupling of these processes to biological function.
