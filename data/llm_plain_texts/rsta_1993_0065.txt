tldr: A 15-month study was conducted to analyze the atmospheric concentrations and sea surface fluxes of trace metals, trace organics, and nitrogen species over the southern North Sea. The research found that the atmosphere is a minor source of nitrogen species compared to the North Atlantic seawater inflow, but it contributes significantly to the total nitrogen flux to the sea surface. The study also identified the major source of these contaminants as air that had recently crossed over the U.K.
