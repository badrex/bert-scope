  - Evolution
  - Porifera
  - Lateral vibrations
tldr: The author investigates the lateral vibrations of bars with variable sections and their potential influence on the evolution of organisms, particularly sponges. They suggest that vibrations may have played a role in the development of certain sponge spicules, and recommend further research in this area.
