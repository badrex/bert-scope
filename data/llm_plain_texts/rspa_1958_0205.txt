tldr: The authors propose a model for the molecular arrangement in liquid water, based on X-ray diffraction and infra-red absorption measurements. They suggest that water molecules form a cubic structure with an octahedral coordination, involving both hydrogen bonds and O contacts. This model is supported by the density of water and the melting entropy of ice, and provides a better description of the average molecular packing in liquid water.
