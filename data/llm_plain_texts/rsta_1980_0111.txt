tldr: This study investigates the impact of residual elements and microstructure on reheat cracking in 2%CrMo weld metal. The research finds that the type of microstructure determines whether or not cracking occurs, and the extent of cracking depends on the type of microstructure. Coarse-grained regions with smooth boundaries are more resistant to cracking than partially or fully formed regions.
