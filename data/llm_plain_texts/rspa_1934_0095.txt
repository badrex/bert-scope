tldr: This article discusses the change in resistance in a magnetic field using the theory of quantum mechanics. The authors analyze the behavior of electrons in a crystal lattice and explain how the resistance changes when a magnetic field is applied. They provide mathematical calculations and numerical integrations to support their findings.
