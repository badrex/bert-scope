tldr: The article investigates the linear and nonlinear stabilities of a horizontal layer of an elasticoviscous fluid, using Oldroyd's stress-rate-of-strain relations. The study focuses on the effects of the Prandtl number, Rayleigh number, and adiabatic temperature gradient on the fluid's behavior. The results show that steady convection is preferred for all relevant values of the Prandtl number, and plane disturbances govern the evolution of the fluid in both linear and nonlinear cases. The adiabatic temperature gradient stabilizes the layer in the linear theory but can destabilize it in the nonlinear theory under certain conditions.
