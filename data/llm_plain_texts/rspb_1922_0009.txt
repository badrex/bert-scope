tldr: The author investigates the hypertrophy of interstitial cells in the testicles of guinea pigs under different experimental conditions. They found that even small testicular fragments can cause normal masculinization in animals, and that the hypertrophy of interstitial cells is not always a compensatory response. The author also suggests that local conditions, such as blood supply, may play a role in the development of interstitial tissue.
