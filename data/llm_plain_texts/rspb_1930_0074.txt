tldr: This article investigates the differential action of X-rays on tissue, growth, and vitality. The authors study the biological reaction to X-radiation in relation to time, observing that a longer exposure time can increase the reaction. They also discuss the concept of a threshold dose and the repair factor in the context of X-ray exposure. The study is conducted on the alantoic membrane of chicks and the skin of mice using homogeneous and mixed radiation.
