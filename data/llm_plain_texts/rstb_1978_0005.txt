tldr: The author provides a detailed description and reconstruction of Canadaspis perfecta, a well-preserved crustacean from the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale. The study reveals the cephalon had five somites, the thorax had eight, and the abdomen had seven, excluding the telson. The evidence suggests that C. perfecta fed on coarse particles, possibly with the aid of currents set up by its biramous appendages. The author also redefines the order Ganadaspidida and family Ganadaspididae, and amends the subclass Phyllocarida to include Canadaspis.
