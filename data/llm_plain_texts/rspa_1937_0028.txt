tldr: The authors investigated the energy exchange between hydrogen and deuterium molecules and a platinum surface. They found that the accommodation coefficients for hydrogen and deuterium were 0.200 and 0.201, respectively, relative to a saturated wire. The results showed that the accommodation coefficients were independent of the gas in which the saturation occurred. The authors also described a new method for preparing deuterium, which they found to be simple, easy to control, and produce consistent purity.
