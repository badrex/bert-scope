tldr: The authors studied the growth kinetics of single crystal lamellae in polyisoprene melts using thin film electron microscopy. They found that the growth rate of lamellar crystals is independent of crystal length and depends on temperature and chemical composition of the polymer. The growth rate is highly sensitive to the presence of trans-units and crosslinks in the polymer, which affect the probability of secondary nucleus formation. This research provides insights into the factors governing crystallization rates in linear polymers with imperfections such as trans-units and crosslinks.
