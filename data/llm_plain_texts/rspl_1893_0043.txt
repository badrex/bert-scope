tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the flow of electric currents and energy dissipation in circuits with measurable inductance and capacitance. They discovered that energy dissipation occurs not only in the wire circuit but also in the dielectric of the capacitor. The results showed that the critical discharge and oscillatory behavior of the circuits can be influenced by the resistance and inductance values.
