tldr: This article evaluates the chemical heterogeneity in the Earth's mantle by analyzing the major element heterogeneity in the mantle sources of basalts. The authors use isotopic ratios of various elements in basaltic rocks to understand the evolution of the mantle and its composition. They discuss the differences in the mantle sources of basalts from various locations, such as the Azores, Iceland, and mid-ocean ridges, and how these differences can be used as indicators of mantle heterogeneity.
