revised_title: 'Molybdenum K-Radiation-Induced Secondary Cathode Rays: A Comparative Study'
semantic_tags:
  - X-ray spectroscopy
  - Electron energies
  - Molybdenum K-radiations
  - Secondary cathode rays
  - Atomic constants
tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the energies of electrons expelled by molybdenum K-radiations from various targets. They compared their results with previous work and found a higher scale of electron energies. The study has implications for the evaluation of fundamental atomic constants.
