revised_title: 'The Effect of Radiomimetic Substances on DNA Synthesis and Function in Bacteriophage Systems'
semantic_tags:
  - DNA replication

tldr: 'The study investigates the impact of radiomimetic substances, specifically di(2-chloroethyl)methylamine (HN2), on deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis and function in bacteriophage systems. The research focuses on bacteriophage T2 during its intracellular growth cycle. The findings reveal that HN2 affects the DNA replication process and alters the sensitivity of the infected cells at different stages of the growth cycle. The study provides insights into the mode of action of alkylating agents on intracellular phage and phage precursors.'
