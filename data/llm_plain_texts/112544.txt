tldr: The author conducted experiments on the combustion of hydrogen and carbonic oxide in oxygen under high pressure. They found that dense gases and vapors become luminous at much lower temperatures than less dense gases, and this luminosity increases with pressure. The author also observed that the spectrum of the flames was continuous, which has implications for understanding the constitution of celestial bodies like the sun and stars.
