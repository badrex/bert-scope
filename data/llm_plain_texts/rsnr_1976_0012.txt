tldr: This article discusses the contributions of Henry Moseley and William Pole to the field of bridge-building in the 19th century. Moseley's work on the statics of masonry arches and his principle of least resistance influenced leading engineers like Robert Stephenson and Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Moseley's book, which covered Navier's work on the elastic theory of bending and strength of beams, was relevant to bridge-building and helped develop wrought iron girder bridges. His use of energy as a device in structural mechanics and his work on the internal work or strain energy of beams were also significant contributions to the field.
