tldr: 'Walther Nernst was a versatile and original scientist who made significant contributions to physics and chemistry. He is best known for his work on the Nernst lamp, which improved incandescent lamps, and for enunciating the Third Law of Thermodynamics. Nernst's research spanned various fields, including the study of nerve excitation, the development of the Nernst-Ettinghausen effect, and the investigation of specific heats of substances at low temperatures. His influential book, Theoretical Chemistry, helped shape the education and outlook of chemists, physicists, and biologists for generations.'
