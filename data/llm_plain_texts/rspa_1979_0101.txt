tldr: This article discusses the problem of deriving scalar potentials governing electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations of vacuum space-times. For algebraically special vacuum background space-times, explicit formulae are given in terms of derivatives of the scalar potential. The study of linearized perturbations in relativity theory is significantly lightened by this concept. The article also presents a generalization of Penrose's treatment of the electromagnetic field to a curved vacuum space-time, confirming previous results and providing new insights.
