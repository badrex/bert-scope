tldr: 'Josiah Wedgwood attempts to connect his strong fire thermometer with the common mercurial one, aiming to create a uniform series of heat measurements. He uses the expansion of metals as a principle for an intermediate measure and develops a gage to measure the expansion and contraction of materials. The gage is made of a mixture of tobacco-pipe clay and charcoal, which allows for accurate measurements of heat and expansion.'
