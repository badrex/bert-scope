tldr: The article discusses the interpretation of circular dichroism in coordination compounds, focusing on the ligand field transitions of d and low-spin systems. The angular overlap model is applied to tris(bidentate) and bis(bidontate) chromophores, considering the perturbation due to chelation and the chirality caused by it. The parentage problem for interrelating absolute configurations is also discussed. The results of the angular overlap model are compared with those of the electrostatic model.
