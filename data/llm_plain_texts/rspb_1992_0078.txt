tldr: This study investigates the clonal structure of the introduced freshwater snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum using DNA fingerprinting. The research reveals that the snail has three widespread obligate parthenogenetic clones resulting from a mid-19th Century introduction from Australasia. The low levels of genotypic diversity are discussed in relation to the snail's typical occurrence in man-made or immature habitats.
