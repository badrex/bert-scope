tldr: This study investigates the response of diatom communities to changes in acidity in non-planktonic habitats of Welsh lakes. The research focuses on the composition of diatom communities, seasonality, and the relation of each community to the mean pH of the lake's water. The findings provide insights into how diatoms can be used as indicators of lake acidity and help in understanding the impact of liming on lake ecosystems.
