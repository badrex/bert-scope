tldr: Samuel Sharp presents an improved method of opening the cornea for cataract removal, building on the work of Monsieur Daviel. He shares his success rate, observations, and challenges faced during the operation. Sharp's method involves using a thin knife to create an incision in the cornea, allowing the removal of the cataract and potentially improving the patient's vision.
