tldr: This study investigates the distribution of the incubation period for AIDS using a substantial set of data from patients who contracted the virus through transfusions. The authors develop statistical models to estimate the incubation period and assess the influence of age and sex on it. They find that age is statistically significant, while sex is not. The study highlights the challenges in interpreting these data and the additional information needed to resolve them.
