tldr: This article compares three models of stomatal control involving leaf water status, root messages, and an interaction between both variables. The study investigates how these models differ and their potential impact on water flux models. The results show that the model involving an interaction between leaf water status and root messages provides the most consistent simulations with experimental data, and can apply to a range of environmental conditions without the need for adjustments. The findings suggest that accurate calculations of root water potential are crucial for modeling soil-plant-atmosphere water transfer.
