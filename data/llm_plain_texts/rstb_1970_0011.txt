tldr: "The authors studied the activity of chymotrypsin in solution and found that the enzyme's catalytic reactions are more complex than previously thought. They discovered that the enzyme's conformation and ionization state play a crucial role in its activity. Chymotrypsin's function is the catalytic hydrolysis of proteins in the intestine, breaking amide bonds near aromatic amino acids. The authors also found that the enzyme's activity is related to the conversion of catalytically inactive chymotrypsinogen to the active enzyme."
