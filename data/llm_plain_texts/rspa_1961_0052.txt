tldr: This study investigates the generation and separation of electric charge in thunderclouds, focusing on the role of soft hail formation. The authors found that the electrification resulting from ice crystal collisions and the freezing of supercooled water droplets on hailstones can generate and separate charge at the required rate for thunderstorm electrification. The charging mechanism is explained by the preferential migration of protons along the temperature gradient established during contact between ice crystals and hailstones.
