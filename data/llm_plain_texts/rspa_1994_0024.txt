tldr: The authors study the linear instability of spatially quasi-periodic states in the Ginzburg-Landau equation, which is a model equation for superconductor physics and near-critical hydrodynamic stability problems. They develop a geometric theory to determine the conditions for instability and provide a relation between the KAM persistence theorem and the linear stability of the states.
