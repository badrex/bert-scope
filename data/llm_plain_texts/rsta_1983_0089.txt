revised_title: 'Einstein Gravitation as a Long Wavelength Effective Field Theory'

  - Quantum Gravity
  - Effective Field Theory

  - Asymptotically Free Theory
  - Dimensional Transmutation
tldr: The author proposes that Einstein gravitation is a long wavelength effective field theory rather than a fundamental theory. This idea is based on the concept of dimensional transmutation, where dimensional physical parameters are calculable in terms of a mass parameter. The author discusses the history and current status of this theory, as well as its implications for the unification of matter and gravitational theories.
