tldr: The authors, S. F. Boys and Sir John Lennard-Jones, present advanced calculations for the wave functions of the three lowest states of the beryllium atom. They used the variational method with exponential functions and provided more accurate results than previous calculations. These wave functions can be used to analyze electronic positional correlations and predict atomic properties.
