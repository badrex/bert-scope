tldr: This article presents experiments on high-pressure glow and arc discharges in hydrogen to study the columnar transition. The authors measured the relative intensities of the Balmer lines emitted by the discharge column section and derived the variation of the excitation temperatures through the discharge transition region. The results show that the excitation temperatures change with current and pressure variations, indicating a thermally dependent mechanism of arc column formation in hydrogen.
