revised_title: 'Tetrodotoxin's Effect on Neuromuscular Transmission'
semantic_tags:
  - Neuromuscular transmission
  - Tetrodotoxin
  - Acetylcholine release
  - Presynaptic potential
  - Post-synaptic potential
tldr: The authors studied the effects of tetrodotoxin on neuromuscular transmission in frog muscles. They found that tetrodotoxin, a potent local anesthetic, blocks electric excitation in nerve and muscle without interfering with the release of acetylcholine from nerve endings or its local action on the muscle fiber. The study helps to understand the mechanism of transmitter release and the link between presynaptic potential change and post-synaptic potential.
