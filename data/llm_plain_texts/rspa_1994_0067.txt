tldr: This article investigates the nonlinear optical properties of alternate-layer Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of stilbazolium dyes and -tetramethyldipyrryl-methene hydrobromide. The second harmonic generation from these films increases quadratically with film thickness. The nonlinear optical properties are dependent on the compatibility of the dye and spacer molecules. The study reports on the properties of seven alternate-layer structures and shows that the type of spacer influences the tilt angle of the dye molecule and the second harmonic intensity from the interleaved films.
