tldr: This article discusses the Fraunhoffer diffraction patterns obtained from circular aerial arrays used in radio astronomy. The authors present a theoretical analysis of the patterns, which are generated by an aperture consisting of an opaque screen with 64 transparent holes arranged in a circular shape. The patterns are described by three curves, each representing different features of the diffraction pattern.
