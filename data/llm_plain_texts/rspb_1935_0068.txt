tldr: Researchers treated male mice with oestrogenic compounds for 50 days or more to study their effects on cancer incidence. They observed abnormal structures, such as cysts and tubules, in the mice's reproductive system. These structures were lined with squamous keratinizing epithelium and were possibly remnants of the Mullerian duct, brought to view due to metaplastic changes induced by the oestrogenic compounds. Further research is needed to understand the normal occurrence of these structures.
