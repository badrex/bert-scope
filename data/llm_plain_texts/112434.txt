tldr: The author discovered a new red pigment called turacine in the feathers of four species of Touraco, or Plantain-eater birds. Turacine contains 59% copper and is unique among natural pigments. It has a distinct spectrum with two black absorption bands and is consistent in composition across different bird species.
