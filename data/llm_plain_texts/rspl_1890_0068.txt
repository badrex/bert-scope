tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the effect of light, air, and dry soils on the virulence of the tuberculosis bacillus. The results showed that exposure to light and fresh air, as well as dry conditions, reduced the virulence of the bacillus. These findings suggest that improving living conditions, such as ventilation and cleanliness, could help mitigate the spread of tuberculosis.
