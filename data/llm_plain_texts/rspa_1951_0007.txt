tldr: The authors analyze the T + D reaction and explain the energy dependence and absolute magnitude of the cross-section using exact wave-functions of the Coulomb field and a complex reaction length. They find that strong spin-orbit coupling is present, and both s-wave and p-wave transitions contribute to the reaction. The isotropic angular distribution of emitted particles supports these findings.
