tldr: The authors describe a method for separating and analyzing the least volatile gases of atmospheric air, focusing on xenon and krypton. They use a vacuum-jacketed vessel and fractional distillation at low pressure to obtain these gases, and then analyze their spectra using a prism spectroscope. The authors observe significant differences in the spectra of these gases, particularly when a jar is introduced into the circuit.
