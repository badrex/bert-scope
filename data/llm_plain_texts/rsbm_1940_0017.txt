tldr: Alfred Harker was a prominent geologist and petrologist who made significant contributions to the field of geology. He studied slaty cleavage, igneous rocks, and metamorphism, and his work laid the foundation for understanding the relationship between tectonic processes and igneous activity. Harker's research on the Bala Volcanic Series and the Carrock Fell complex helped advance the understanding of rock formations and their transformations.
