tldr: The authors explore the cataphoresis of suspended particles, focusing on the equation of cataphoresis. They discuss the electrical double layer and its role in the cataphoretic velocity, considering the effect of particle shape on the cataphoretic velocity. The study provides insights into the behavior of particles in an electric field and the factors affecting their movement.
