tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the rate of emission of alpha particles from radium. They used various methods to measure the total charge carried by alpha rays and found that the rate of emission was approximately 3.68 x 10^10 disintegrations per unit mass per unit time. This study helped improve the understanding of radioactive changes and energy relations involved in radium decay.
