tldr: The authors mapped the location of the galP gene, which specifies galactose permease activity, on the Escherichia coli linkage map. They used strains with different genetic markers to detect galactose permease activity and found that the galP gene lies between the genetic markers for fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (fda) and 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (serA) at about minute 62 on the E. coli linkage map.
