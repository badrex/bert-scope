tldr: The author investigates the lattice spacings of primary solid solutions in magnesium with elements from Group IIIB and tin and lead. The results confirm that the effect of increasing the valency of the solute tends to expand the lattice of magnesium. The 'a'-spacing-composition curves for the systems studied are smooth and continuous, while the 'c'-spacing curves show a change in direction at an electron concentration of approximately 2-0075. The findings support the suggestion that indium, thallium, white tin, and lead are incompletely ionized in the elementary state.
