tldr: The authors developed a method for determining sodium and potassium concentrations in glandular secretions using quantitative spectrographic analysis. This method allowed for accurate analysis of small sample sizes and provided more reliable results than traditional chemical methods. The technique has applications in understanding the behavior and composition of digestive glands in experimental animals.
