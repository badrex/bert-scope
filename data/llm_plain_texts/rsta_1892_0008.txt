  - Ethyl-alcohol
tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the mechanical stretching and tension in liquids, specifically ethyl-alcohol. They used a method called the "tonometer" to measure the tension and found that the liquid could be stretched and exist stably in a state of tension without any breach of physical continuity. This research expanded understanding of the properties of liquids and their behavior under tension.
