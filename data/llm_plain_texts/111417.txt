tldr: This article explores the thermal effects of fluids in motion, specifically the temperature changes experienced by a body moving slowly through air. The author explains how the motion of air around a body can cause heating and cooling effects on different parts of the body, and provides equations to calculate the temperature changes. The study has implications for understanding the behavior of objects moving through air, such as vehicles and aircraft.
