tldr: This article discusses the superconductivity properties of thin mercury films. The authors found that the critical magnetic fields required to restore normal conductivity are larger for thin films than for the bulk metal. They also discovered that the depth of field penetration increases as the temperature of the specimen approaches the transition temperature. The superconducting properties of the films are insensitive to variations in deposition temperature and structure, making the experimental results dependent only on the size of the films.
