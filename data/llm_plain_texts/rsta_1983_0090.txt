  - Weak Interaction
tldr: The author discusses the concept of unification in physics, focusing on grand unified theories, technicolor, supersymmetry, and supergravity. The article explores how these theories attempt to explain the values of fundamental constants, such as the fine structure constant and the weak interaction scale. Supersymmetry is presented as a promising approach to understanding the weak interaction scale and potentially unifying it with gravity.
