tldr: The authors studied the effect of a magnetic field on the conductivity of thin wires. They found that the resistivity of a thin wire decreases in a magnetic field due to the lengthening of the effective mean free path caused by the spiral motion of electrons. This discovery opens up the possibility of determining the electronic mean free path and the momentum of electrons at the surface of the Fermi distribution, which helps in understanding the radius of electronic orbits in a given field.
