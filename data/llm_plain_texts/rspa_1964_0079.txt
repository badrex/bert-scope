tldr: The authors studied the thermal decomposition of diethyl ether, analyzing the kinetics and mechanisms of the uninhibited reaction. They found that the overall reaction order was between 1 and 2, with a molecular split of diethyl ether into ethanol and ethylene. The reaction leading to acetaldehyde and ethane is concluded to be almost entirely a free-radical chain process. A detailed chain mechanism is proposed, involving first-order initiation and the reaction between radicals as the chain-ending step.
