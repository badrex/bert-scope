tldr: The study investigates the role of the pinna, or external ear, in human sound localization and attention. The research demonstrates that the pinna performs an essential acoustical transformation that helps in localization and attention to sound sources. The mathematical model for this transformation also explains other aspects of human hearing, such as pitch perception, speech recognition, and selective attention.
