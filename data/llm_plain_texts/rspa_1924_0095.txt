tldr: The authors analyze the many-lined spectrum of hydrogen and discuss the molecular configurations involved. They explore the limitations of the law of constant second differences and propose a test to better understand the structure of the emitter of these lines. They also adopt Kramers and Pauli's formula for spectral terms to calculate the moment of inertia and angular momentum of the molecule.
