tldr: The authors conducted experiments on dogs to study the effects of removing the large intestine and increasing fat intake on general metabolism. They found that the absence of the large intestine did not hinder the dogs from gaining weight, and that a similar excretion occurs in the large intestine as in the small intestine. This research helps to understand the functions of the large intestine and its role in digestion and metabolism.
