tldr: This article examines the symmetry properties of electron diffraction patterns using the convergent beam and bend extinction contour techniques. The authors study the diffraction of fast electrons by a thin slab and find that the pattern symmetries can be described by thirty-one diffraction groups. They provide tables to help identify crystal point groups from these patterns and demonstrate the method with experiments on germanium and gallium-arsenide specimens.
