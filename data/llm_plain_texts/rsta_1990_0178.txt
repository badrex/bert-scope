tldr: This article discusses the development and potential of ultra-high-speed echo-planar imaging (EPI) in medical applications. EPI allows for the acquisition of two-dimensional images in 64-128 ms, reducing movement artifacts and providing real-time dynamic imaging. The method is particularly useful in neuroimaging, cardiac imaging, and gastrointestinal imaging, allowing for the study of flow phenomena, cardiac events, and bowel peristalsis.
