tldr: The authors investigated the pyrolysis of benzoyl bromide in the presence of toluene, finding that the rate-determining step is the unimolecular dissociation of the molecule. They estimated the activation energy and calculated the heat of formation of benzoyl radicals, leading to the determination of various bond dissociation energies.
