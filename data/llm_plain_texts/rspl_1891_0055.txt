tldr: The author observed the spectrum of Nova Aurigae and discovered several new lines in its spectrum. They also noticed that the lines were broad and not accompanied by any falling off of intensity at the edges. The author hypothesizes that the broadening of the lines could be due to internal agitations within the star or atmospheric tremors. The observations and analysis provide valuable information about the nature of Nova Aurigae and its place in the cosmos.
