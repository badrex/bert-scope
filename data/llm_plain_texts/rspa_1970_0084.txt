revised_title: Temperature and Pressure Variations in Dielectric Constants of Ionic Crystals
semantic_tags:
  - Dielectric constants
  - Ionic crystals
  - Temperature dependence
  - Pressure dependence
  - Anharmonic effects
tldr: The authors measured the dielectric constants of alkali and thallium halides at various temperatures and pressures. They separated the temperature and volume-dependent variations in dielectric constants and discussed the anharmonic self-energies of long-wave transverse-optic phonons. The results provide insights into the anharmonic effects in ionic compounds and their potential applications in materials science.
