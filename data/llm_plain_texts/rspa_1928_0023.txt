tldr: Dirac and Fowler present a wave equation that is invariant under a Lorentz transformation and equivalent to the previous wave equation in the limit of large quantum numbers. They introduce new dynamical variables and discuss the behavior of an electron in a central field of force, finding that the electron behaves as though it has a magnetic moment and an electric moment. The wave equation is then transformed into a differential equation in the radial variable, with the orientation of the system removed.
