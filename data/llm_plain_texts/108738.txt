tldr: The author presents a comprehensive study of systems of linear indeterminate equations and congruences, focusing on matrices and determinants. They introduce concepts such as rectangular matrices, complementary types, and prime matrices, and explain how to find solutions to systems of equations using these tools. The author also discusses the importance of fundamental sets of solutions in the theory of linear indeterminate equations.
