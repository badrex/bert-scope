tldr: Researchers discovered three new species of coccolithophorids, a type of marine phytoplankton, in Arctic regions. The new species, Wigwamma arctica, Wigwamma annulifera, and Calciarcus alaskensis, have unique coccolith structures and crystallographic details that help classify and understand their evolutionary relationships. These findings contribute to the understanding of Arctic marine ecosystems and the potential impact of climate change on these organisms.
