tldr: The article discusses the nuclear interactions in europium vanadate, focusing on the ground configuration of the europium ion and its interactions with the first excited electronic state. It explores the effects of electronic Zeeman energy, magnetic hyperfine interaction, and nuclear Zeeman interaction on the nuclear levels. The author also suggests alternative experimental methods, such as hole-burning experiments, nuclear orientation, and dynamic nuclear polarization, to study europium vanadate's nuclear interactions and properties.
