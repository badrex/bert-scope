tldr: The authors conducted experiments on muscles poisoned with mono-iodo-acetic acid (IAA) to study the relationship between heat production and osmotic changes during muscular contraction. They discovered that the total heat produced during stimulation to exhaustion in the absence of oxygen was lower in IAA-poisoned muscles compared to normal muscles. The resulting osmotic pressure change in IAA-poisoned muscles was also lower, indicating a different energy metabolism process occurring in these muscles.
