tldr: This article discusses the research conducted on the absorption of ultra-violet rays by various organic substances. The authors used a spectroscope attached to a photographic camera to study the effects of different substances on the ultra-violet spectrum. They found that the normal alcohols, fatty acids, and ethereal salts have varying levels of transparency to the ultra-violet rays. Additionally, they discovered that isomeric bodies exhibit different absorption spectra, which can be used to identify and test the purity of organic substances.
