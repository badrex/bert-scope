tldr: The author, William Bowman, examines the minute structure and movements of voluntary muscles. He describes the composition of muscle fibers, the existence of a delicate and transparent sheath called Sarcolemma, and the role of discs in muscle contractions. He also discusses the differences in muscle size and structure in various animals and provides evidence for his theories through illustrations and examples.
