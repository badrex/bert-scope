tldr: The authors conducted experiments using a mass spectrograph to study the formation of the helium hydride molecule (HeH). They discovered that the molecule is formed through an attachment process involving ionized hydrogen and a neutral helium atom. The study provides insights into the conditions and mechanisms leading to the formation of this molecule.
