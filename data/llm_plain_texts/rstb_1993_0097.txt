tldr: This article estimates the effective pressure differences that drive the subcerebral canal motions in swimming clupeid fish, which are essential for stimulating the lateral-line neuromasts. The study shows that simultaneous yawing can significantly reduce the effective pressure difference, and suggests that swimming clupeid fishes may use an active mechanism to minimize hydrodynamic resistance.
