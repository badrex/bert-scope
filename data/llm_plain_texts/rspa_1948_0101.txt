tldr: This article investigates the iron-carbon-nitrogen system and discovers new ternary interstitial alloys containing iron, carbon, and nitrogen. The authors study the reactions of carbon monoxide with iron nitrides and ammonia with iron carbides, leading to the formation of iron-carbon-nitrogen alloys with up to 26 atomic carbon. The study also provides a ternary diagram of the iron-carbon-nitrogen system, showing probable phase fields at various temperatures.
