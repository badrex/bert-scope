revised_title: Silurian and Devonian Continental Movements and Plate Tectonics
semantic_tags:
  - Plate tectonics
  - Palaeomagnetism
  - Continental drift
  - Silurian period
  - Devonian period
tldr: This article reviews the critical palaeomagnetic evidence used to create Silurian and Devonian reconstructions, focusing on the positions of continents during the Middle Palaeozoic era. It discusses the closure of the Iapetus Ocean, the configuration of Laurentia, Baltica, and Great Britain, and the plate tectonic associations of terranes that make up New England, Britain, and Variscan Europe. The article also examines the width of the ocean separating Laurussia and Gondwana and whether a late Devonian Pangaea existed.
