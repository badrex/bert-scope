revised_title: 'The Periodic Nature of Soft X-Ray Emissions in Elements'
semantic_tags:
  - X-ray emission
  - Periodic table
  - Atomic number
  - Electron emission
  - Photoelectric effect
tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments to study the efficiency of different elements in emitting soft X-rays. They found that the efficiency is a periodic function of the atomic number, with the highest efficiency near the middle of each group in the periodic table. This discovery challenges the previous assumption that efficiency is proportional to the square root of the atomic number.'
