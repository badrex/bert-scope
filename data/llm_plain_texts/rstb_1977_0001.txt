tldr: 'This study examines new exposures of lake and mire sediments from Bodmin Moor, Cornwall, and provides a detailed reconstruction of the vegetational history of the Late-Devensian, early, and later Flandrian periods. The research uses pollen analysis and radiocarbon dating to describe 12 distinct pollen assemblages and understand the impact of climate change and human activity on the region's vegetation over time.'
