tldr: The article discusses the differentiation and morphogenesis of mammary cells in vitro using a rat mammary cell line. The reversible differentiation leads to the formation of two types of microstructures, domes and ridges. The study explores the conditions and factors affecting this differentiation, including the role of cell-produced factors and the importance of cell density. The findings have implications for understanding mammary gland development.
