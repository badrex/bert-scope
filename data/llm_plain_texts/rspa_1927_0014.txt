  - Electrostatic potential energy
tldr: This article explores the crystal energy and structure of sodium nitrate by calculating the electrostatic potential energy and the repulsive-force potential energy. The authors use Lennard-Jones and Dent's data to determine the energy of the crystal for various configurations and find that the stable configuration lies on a series of configurations. The study helps in understanding the properties and behavior of ionic crystals.
