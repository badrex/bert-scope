tldr: The authors discuss the production of T-mesons and the hypothesis of preferential emission from hydrogen. They analyze the data from various experiments and suggest further experiments to test the hypothesis. The results support the idea that T-mesons can be emitted from nuclei other than hydrogen, but the crucial point is whether more T-mesons per nucleon are emitted from hydrogen than from heavier nuclei under the same irradiation.
