  - Transition metal complexes

tldr: The authors describe the use of local multipole expansions to analyze spin-density distributions in transition metal complexes using polarized neutron diffraction data. They discuss the determination of local orbital populations and provide quantitative atomic spin-density distributions in the ion. The results show a spin transfer of 0.02(1) electrons to each ligand atom and a well-defined spin separation between centers.
