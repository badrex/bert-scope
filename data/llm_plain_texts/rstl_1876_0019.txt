tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the residual charge of a Leyden jar and the behavior of dielectrics under electric force. They proposed a hypothesis that dielectrics have a property similar to coercive force in magnetism, where the polar state requires time for development and disappearance. The authors also investigated the effect of vibration on the electric polarity of a dielectric and found that it accelerates changes in polarity and liberates residual charge.
