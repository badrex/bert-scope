tldr: The authors discuss the use of local seismometer networks to observe and analyze small earthquakes, focusing on determining focal positions and understanding crustal structure. They describe recent advancements in seismometer technology and location routines, which allow for more accurate and detailed analysis of micro-earthquake activity and strain release. The authors also emphasize the importance of selecting the appropriate network configuration and understanding crustal structure for accurate results.
