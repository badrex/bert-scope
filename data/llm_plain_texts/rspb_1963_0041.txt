tldr: The author investigates the effect of thiourea on actomyosin inactivation and the nature of viscous tone in a molluscan smooth muscle. They find that thiourea inactivates the contractile actomyosin system but does not affect the tonic mechanism associated with tropomyosin A, which is responsible for maintaining passive tension or 'catch' in the muscle. This discovery helps to understand the underlying mechanism of smooth muscle contraction and relaxation.
