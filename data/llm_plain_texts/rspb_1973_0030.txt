tldr: This study investigates the relationship between chloroplasts from Codium fragile and the mollusc Elysia viridis. It examines the characteristics of isolated Codium chloroplasts and their ability to fix carbon photosynthetically. The research also explores the potential importance of chloroplast photosynthesis to the mollusc and the length of time chloroplasts remain functional within the animal.
