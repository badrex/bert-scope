tldr: This study investigates the mechanical properties and failure modes of polymer bonded explosives (PBXs) to understand their strength and safety. The researchers tested various PBX compositions with different binders and explosive types. They used the Brazilian test to measure tensile strengths and strains to failure and laser speckle photography to measure in-plane displacement fields. The results showed that compositions based on micronized crystals were the strongest, and mechanical twinning played a significant role in failure modes. The techniques used in this research can be applied to other composite systems.
