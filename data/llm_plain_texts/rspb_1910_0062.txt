tldr: The authors studied Trypanosoma brucei, a species of trypanosome that causes diseases in domestic animals, during their work in Uganda. They discovered that this trypanosome has two main forms, long and slender with a free flagellum, and short and stumpy without a free flagellum. They also found that the average length of the trypanosomes they observed was 23.6 microns. This research contributes to understanding the biology and impact of trypanosome diseases in Uganda and beyond.
