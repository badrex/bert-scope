tldr: The authors explore the use of electrical fields to control gas flows in combustion processes. They develop the theory of ionic winds for flame ions traveling towards electrodes, allowing them to predict entrainment and main stream gas velocities. By confining entrainment to specific regions, large flow velocities can be induced at the flame, which can be used to modify various combustion processes. The authors also examine the potential of varying parameters such as geometry, temperature, pressure, and composition, as well as the effects of superimposing magnetic fields. Practical examples are considered, confirming that confined entrainment can be used to aerate diffusion flames accurately and without risking flashback or requiring an air supply, metering, and mixing systems.
