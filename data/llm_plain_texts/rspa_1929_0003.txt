revised_title: The Thermionic Emission Constant A: A Comprehensive Analysis
semantic_tags:
  - Thermionic emission
  - Work function
  - Surface potential
  - Electron conduction
  - Nordheim's theory
tldr: This article explores the thermionic emission constant A and applies Nordheim's theory to explain the relationship between the constants A of the thermionic emission formula. The author concludes that the theory provides a satisfactory explanation of the observed facts when properly applied, addressing discrepancies in absolute magnitude between observed and theoretical values of A.
