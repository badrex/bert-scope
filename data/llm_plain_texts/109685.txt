tldr: The author, William Lax, developed a method to examine and measure the divisions of astronomical instruments with greater accuracy. By using a brass arc and various intervals, Lax could determine the actual errors in the instrument's divisions. This method allowed for more precise astronomical observations and increased confidence in the results. The process took about ninety-eight hours, but the benefits of improved accuracy made the effort worthwhile.
