tldr: The authors discovered that older leaves play a crucial role in regulating the size of leaf primordia in Lupinus albus plants. By cutting down older leaves, they found that the younger leaves and new leaves cover larger arcs of the circumference. This study helps to understand the phyllotaxis pattern and the factors controlling leaf formation.
