tldr: The author presents a self-recording method for measuring the intensity of the chemical action of total daylight, which reduces the need for personal attention and can be adopted in meteorological observatories. The method uses sensitive paper exposed to daylight at given intervals, with a self-acting arrangement that records hourly intensities. This innovation allows for more accurate measurements of the chemical intensity of total daylight in different locations, times of day, and periods of the year.
