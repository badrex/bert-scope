tldr: The author conducted an experiment to study the rate of diffusion of gold in solid lead at the ordinary temperature. After four years, the gold was found to have diffused only a small amount into the lead, with the richest layer being the one in direct contact with the gold. The results showed the importance of temperature in relation to diffusion and demonstrated that the action of a solvent for the gold is necessary for the diffusion process.
