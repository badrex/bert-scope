tldr: The author investigates the contact of surfaces and the conditions for various degrees of contact, such as two-pointic, three-pointic, and higher degrees. They explore the implications of these contacts in geometry and analyze the transformation of equations to express the results. The study also considers the cases where contact holds for all axes through a point, called circumaxal contact.
