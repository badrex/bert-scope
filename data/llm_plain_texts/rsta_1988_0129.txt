tldr: The authors present the geochronology and isotopic constraints on the source characteristics of the three granitoid belts in the Tibetan Plateau, which help to understand the geological evolution of Tibet. They find that the Tibetan Plateau is the site of multiple continental collisions through time and that the terranes comprising the plateau have experienced different periods of magmatism and crustal accretion.
