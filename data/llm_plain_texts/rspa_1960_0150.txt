tldr: The authors measured the nuclear magnetic dipole moments of stable europium isotopes using a new method of resonance in three loops in a short atomic beam. They also estimated a theoretical value for the hyperfine structure anomaly. This research provides a better understanding of the atomic and nuclear properties of europium isotopes.
