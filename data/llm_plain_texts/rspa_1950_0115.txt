tldr: The authors conducted non-empirical calculations to study the effects of configuration interaction in cyclobutadiene, a simple conjugated system. They found that configuration interaction has a significant impact on the energy levels of different states, leading to a drastic change in the energy-level scheme compared to configuration wave functions. The valence-bond and molecular orbital theories do not satisfactorily account for the energy levels according to these results.
