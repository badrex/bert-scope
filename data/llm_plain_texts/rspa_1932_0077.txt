revised_title: 'Thermal Capacity and Atomic Heat of Bismuth at Higher Temperatures'

tldr: The authors developed a high-temperature vacuum calorimeter to measure the thermal capacity and atomic heat of bismuth between 30°C to 370°C. They found that the atomic heat exceeded the Debye maximum at all temperatures above about 260°C, suggesting that anharmonic oscillations may be responsible for the deviation from the expected values. Their work is in good agreement with previous measurements by Anderson.
