revised_title: Cosmic String Vortex Motion and Fluid Dynamics
semantic_tags:
  - Cosmic strings

  - Complex geometry
tldr: The author investigates the motion of vortices near a cosmic string using complex variable techniques. They find that a single vortex cannot remain at rest but must orbit the cosmic string. The study also discusses the motion of vortices in the wake induced by a moving cosmic string, with potential connections to string theory.
