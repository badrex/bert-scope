tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the physiological effects of electric currents on frog nerves. They discovered that the direct and inverse electric currents cause different muscle contractions in the frog's limbs. The author also found that the strength and duration of the electric current affect the nerve's excitability and the resulting contractions. This research sheds light on the complex relationship between electricity and the nervous system.
