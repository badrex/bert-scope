tldr: The author investigates the phase transformation in pure cobalt from face-centered cubic (FCC) to hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structures. They propose a theory that considers the role of crystal defects, specifically faults, in the transformation process. The author also discusses the relationship between the transformation and the characteristics of martensitic transformations in other materials.
