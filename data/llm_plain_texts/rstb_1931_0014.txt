tldr: The authors conducted a quantitative examination of the carbon metabolism in various species of Penicillium and Citromyces. They used the carbon balance sheet method to analyze the types of products formed from glucose. The study revealed distinct groups of species with specific characteristics, such as the production of citromycetina, large amounts of non-volatile acids, and unique metabolic products like ethyl acetate and mannitol.
