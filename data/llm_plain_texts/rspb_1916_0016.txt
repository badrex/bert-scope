tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the relationship between protozoa and soil bacteria. They developed a method to partially sterilize soil and isolate protozoa from bacteria to better understand their impact on the soil's bacterial flora. The results showed that the introduction of protozoa into the soil significantly reduced the number of bacteria, highlighting the important role of protozoa in soil ecosystems.
