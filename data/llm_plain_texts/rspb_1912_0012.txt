tldr: The authors studied the fossil flora of the Forest of Dean coalfield in Gloucestershire and compared it with the coalfields of West England and South Wales. They found that while there is a general agreement in flora, there are also important differences. The authors discussed the relationships between these coalfields and concluded that the Forest of Dean basin has no obvious relationship to the South Wales or Radstock-Bristol coalfields. They also provided evidence that the Forest of Dean coalfield overlies unconformably the so-called Millstone Grits.
