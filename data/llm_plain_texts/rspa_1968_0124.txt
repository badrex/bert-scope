revised_title: Extending Group Theory to Study Accidental Degeneracy in Quantum Mechanics

tldr: The article introduces the concept of conditional invariance, a new type of constant of motion, to study accidental degeneracy in quantum mechanics. By generalizing the notion of invariance, the authors extend the application of group theory to the study of degeneracy in quantum mechanics, providing a better understanding of Hamiltonian degeneracy and its relation to symmetry.
