tldr: The author investigates the completeness problem for eigenfunction formulae in relativistic quantum mechanics, specifically in the case of a scalar potential that is a function of the radial coordinate only. The analysis involves the use of Stieltjes integrals and Legendre functions, and it is shown that Darwin's functions form a complete set.
