tldr: The authors investigated the spontaneous magnetization of copper-nickel alloys, focusing on the system's importance in the electron theory of ferromagnetism. They used two separate experimental setups to measure the magnetization and the magnetocaloric effect accurately over a wider temperature range. The results showed that the copper-nickel alloy system behaves differently from other systems, with the spontaneous magnetization curve deviating from the theoretical curve over most of the temperature range. This study provides valuable information for understanding the magnetic properties of copper-nickel alloys and their potential applications in ferromagnetic materials.
