tldr: The authors conducted experiments on Lupinus albus plants to study the regulation of phyllotaxis. They discovered that the secondary extension of leaves affects the position of the next leaf, and that the primary arc over which a leaf is determined is crucial for its development. The research provides insights into the factors that influence leaf formation and the potential for smoother and more rapid regulation in other plant species.
