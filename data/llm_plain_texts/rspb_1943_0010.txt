tldr: The author investigates the fate of haemoglobin in Rhodnius prolixus and other blood-sucking arthropods. They discover that most haemoglobin is broken down in the gut to protohaematin, while a small amount is absorbed into the haemolymph as kathaemoglobin. This pigment is taken up by the salivary glands, stomach, and intestine cells, undergoing various transformations. The study provides insights into the digestion and circulation of haemoglobin in insects and its potential implications for understanding protein absorption in the animal kingdom.
