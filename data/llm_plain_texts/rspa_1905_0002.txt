tldr: The authors describe the boring of the Simplon Tunnel under the Swiss Alps and the temperature distribution encountered during the process. They recorded the temperature of the rocks using thermometers placed in the tunnel's side wall and observed a maximum temperature of 54.5°C. The authors also discussed the challenges faced, such as the high temperatures in the advanced headings and the presence of hot water "feeders."
