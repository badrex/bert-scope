tldr: The author observed swallows near the Rhine River and discovered that some of them stay behind during winter, seeking refuge in cliffs. He also witnessed the local boys capturing the swallows using a long rammer with a screw at the end. This observation confirmed that some swallows stay behind during winter and migrate later on.
