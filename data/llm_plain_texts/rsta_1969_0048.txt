tldr: This article presents a comprehensive analysis of plume rise formulas and their comparisons with various data sets. The author evaluates different formulas for near-neutral, unstable, and stable conditions, ultimately recommending the modified two-thirds law for near-neutral and unstable conditions, and the Morton, Taylor, and Turner formula for calm, stable conditions. The study aims to provide optimum formulas for predicting buoyant plume rise in various scenarios, contributing to the understanding and management of air pollution.
