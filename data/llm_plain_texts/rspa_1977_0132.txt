tldr: The authors present a study on the variation of electric polarizability in polar liquids using the itinerant oscillator model. They calculate the frequency dependence of polarizability by means of the Langevin equation and linear response theory, accounting for inertial effects. The results show how the Debye absorption peak in the microwave region and the resonance absorption peak in the far infrared or terahertz band can be linked analytically.
