tldr: This study investigates habitat-dependent selection in a hybrid zone between two European toad species, Bombina bombina and Bombina variegata. The authors conducted a reciprocal translocation experiment, introducing pure Bombina and Variegata tadpoles into different habitats. The results show that Variegata tadpoles have higher survival and growth rates in both habitats, especially in upland puddles. Habitat-dependent selection prevents the invasion of Bombina tadpole traits into the Variegata gene pool, and the strong linkage disequilibria in hybrid populations may be sufficient to maintain the integrity of the two gene pools.
