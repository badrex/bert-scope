tldr: The authors conducted a series of experiments to measure the contact difference of potentials between various substances in galvanic cells using a new and improved apparatus. They found that the algebraical sum of the contact differences of potential was equal to the electro-motive force of the cell, confirming the contact theory of voltaic action. This work helped to clarify the understanding of voltaic action and improve experimental methods.
