tldr: The authors developed a new experimental method to study the photosynthesis of hydrogen chloride and discovered that hydrogen chloride inhibits the rate of reaction. They used this method to examine the photochemical reaction between hydrogen and chlorine in oxygen-free and oxygen-containing mixtures, providing expressions that accurately reproduce the variation in quantum yield under different conditions.
