tldr: The authors explore quadric transformations of one four-dimensional space into another, focusing on Cremona transformations and homaloidal systems of quadrics. They also discuss the reverse transformations and the associated methods for finding them. The study involves various types of primals, quadric surfaces, and cubic and quartic curves, providing insights into the geometry of four-dimensional spaces.
