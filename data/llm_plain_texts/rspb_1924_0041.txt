tldr: The authors conducted a study on the differences in blood sugar between normal individuals and those with diabetes mellitus. They found that diabetic blood sugar has a higher optical rotation, suggesting the presence of complex sugars or other sugar derivatives. The study also showed that after insulin treatment, the nature of the blood sugar becomes more normal, and mild hydrolysis can help distinguish between normal and diabetic cases.
