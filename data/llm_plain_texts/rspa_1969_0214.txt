tldr: The authors studied the interaction of atomic particles with solid surfaces at intermediate energies, focusing on secondary electron emission. They used a magnetic field to separate secondary electrons from scattered ions and found that secondary electron emission is confined to the surface layers of the target atoms. The results showed that the electron emissions from various solid surfaces bombarded with different particles were of the same magnitude, with no direct relation between the secondary electron coefficient and the mass of the target atom. The energy distribution of secondary electrons was also investigated, providing insights into the behavior of charged particles colliding with solid surfaces.
