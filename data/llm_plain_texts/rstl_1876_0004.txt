tldr: The author examines the structure and relations of the alcyonarian Heliopora Cérulea and a species of Sarcophyton, as well as the structure of Millepora, Pocillopora, and Stylaster species. They find that Heliopora is an alcyonarian, which challenges previous beliefs about the classification of corals. The study provides insights into the anatomy and affinities of these corals, contributing to a better understanding of their classification and evolution.
