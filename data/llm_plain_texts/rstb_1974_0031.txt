tldr: This study compares the growth, physique, and anthropometric measurements of two New Guinea populations, Karkar Islanders and Lufa Highlanders. The Lufa population is found to be heavier, more muscular, and skeletally more robust than the Karkar Islanders throughout the growth period. The study also reveals differences in body proportions, head and face dimensions, and the effects of aging between the two populations.
