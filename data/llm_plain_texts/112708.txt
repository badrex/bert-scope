tldr: This study investigates the physiological effects of atropine, digitaline, and aconitine on the heart and blood vessels of frogs. The author found that atropine has no effect on blood vessels, while digitaline and aconitine have different actions on the heart. Digitaline causes violent and disorderly contractions, while aconitine impairs the heart's contractile power and alters its rhythm. These findings contribute to our understanding of these substances' effects on the cardiovascular system.
