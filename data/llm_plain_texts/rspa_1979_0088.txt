tldr: The authors present an exact analysis of the dispersion of a solute in an electrically conducting fluid flowing between two parallel plates under the influence of a uniform transverse magnetic field. They use a generalized dispersion model to evaluate the longitudinal dispersion coefficients as functions of time, finding that for small values of the Hartmann number, the coefficients show rapid fluctuations that decay with increasing Hartmann number. For moderate and large values of the Hartmann number, the coefficients monotonically decrease with increasing Hartmann number.
