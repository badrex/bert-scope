tldr: The author, A. W. Hofmann, describes a new method for synthesizing triethylamine by modifying the reaction between cyanic ether and ethylic potassa. This method involves replacing water with ethyl oxide, leading to the formation of triethylamine. The author also discusses the potential applications and limitations of this reaction in organic synthesis.
