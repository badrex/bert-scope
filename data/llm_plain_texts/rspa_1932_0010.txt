tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the variation of viscosity in carbon dioxide with temperature. They found that the viscosity of carbon dioxide increases more rapidly with temperature than expected, indicating a change in the field of force between the gas molecules. This change is demonstrated by a point of singularity in the graph of viscosity against temperature, suggesting a shift in molecular hardness. The results provide evidence that carbon dioxide molecules can be considered as point centers of repulsive force with a change in the order of the repulsive force at a specific temperature.
