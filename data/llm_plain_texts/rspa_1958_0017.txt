tldr: The authors study the unique properties of the solid phase of methoxypentamethylflavan, a compound that differs from typical crystalline materials. They observe unusual liquid-solid transition effects, such as a range of melting temperatures and hysteresis between melting and solidification. The solid phase forms spherical masses without regular crystal boundaries and exhibits interesting features during solidification. The authors also discuss the similarities between methoxypentamethylflavan and crystalline high polymers.
