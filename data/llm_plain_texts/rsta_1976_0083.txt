tldr: The article discusses crystal growth models in metamorphic tectonites and their relation to natural strain and geological structure. The simple segregation model is introduced to explain the lack of homogeneous equilibrium found in porphyroblasts. The model allows for the definition of diffusion distances during porphyroblast growth and distinguishes between local diffusion distances related to deformation, such as shear zones and segregations. The article emphasizes the importance of understanding the chemical and mechanical processes occurring during metamorphism to fully comprehend the growth of minerals in rocks.
