tldr: The authors develop a mathematical method to determine the energy of interaction between two colloidal metallic particles, using the Debye-Huckel theory of electrolytes. They calculate the free energy associated with the charge on the particles and their ionic atmospheres, providing insights into the stability properties of colloidal solutions.
