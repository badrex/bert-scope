tldr: The author develops a theory of axisymmetric turbulence, which assumes symmetry around a preferred direction. They introduce the concept of axisymmetric tensors and forms and provide a method for deriving the representation of solenoidal axisymmetric vectors. This theory can help explain the emergence of anisotropy in turbulence and has applications in astrophysics and meteorology.
