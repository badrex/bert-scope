tldr: The authors developed an apparatus to measure the electrical conductivity of thin copper oxide films to study the effects of adsorbed gases and reactions between them. They found that adsorbed gases have a greater influence on the superficial conductivity of the oxide than on the bulk conductivity. The method allows for a qualitative understanding of adsorption and catalytic reactions while being quantitatively followed by alternative methods.
