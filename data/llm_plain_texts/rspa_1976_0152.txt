tldr: The author studied the osmotic and activity coefficients of 2:2 electrolytes, providing a theoretical treatment that combines the Kirkwood-Glueckauf-Bjerrum function and a linear ion-water interaction term. The study focused on the electrostatic and statistical contributions to the activity coefficients, leading to a better understanding of the behavior of highly hydrated ions in concentrated solutions. The findings can be applied to improve the representation of activity coefficients in strong solutions of other electrolytes or mixtures.
