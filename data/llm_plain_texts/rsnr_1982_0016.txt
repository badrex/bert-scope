tldr: 'The article highlights the work of Robert Angus Smith, who conducted pioneering studies on precipitation chemistry, which he called "chemical climatology." Smith's research focused on the chemistry of atmospheric precipitation, including ammonia, nitrate, acidity, and other elements. His work provided the beginnings of a chemical climatology and contributed to the understanding of acid rain, its effects on the environment, and its significance in nutrient cycling and geochemical circulation.'
