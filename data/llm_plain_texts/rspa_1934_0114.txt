tldr: 'This study investigates the Raman spectra of water in different states, such as ice, liquid water at various temperatures, and water vapor. The authors found that the Raman bands consist of three components, which they attribute to the presence of single, double, and triple water molecules. The changes in the intensity and frequency of these components help explain the behavior of water in different states and temperatures.'
