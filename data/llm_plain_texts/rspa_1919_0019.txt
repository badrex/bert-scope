tldr: The authors conducted a direct determination of the ionisation potential for electrons in helium using a different method that could distinguish between photoelectric effect and ionisation. They used two sources of electrons and a unique experimental setup to measure the ionisation potential, which was found to be 20 volts. This research aimed to check the validity of Bohr's theory of atomic structure.
