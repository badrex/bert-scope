tldr: The article discusses the observations of ultraviolet interstellar absorption lines and their implications for understanding the physical conditions in interstellar space. The authors analyze the populations of different rotational levels and propose that there is a source of ionization of hydrogen in the clouds. They also explore the mechanisms by which excited vibrational-rotational levels are populated, including fluorescence and molecular formation processes.
