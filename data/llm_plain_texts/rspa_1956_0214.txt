tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the propagation of second sound in uniformly rotating helium II. They discovered an excess attenuation of second sound that is proportional to the angular velocity and independent of second-sound amplitude and frequency. This effect can be explained phenomenologically using the two-fluid model, suggesting that the mutual friction in rotating helium may contain a component perpendicular to the rotation.
