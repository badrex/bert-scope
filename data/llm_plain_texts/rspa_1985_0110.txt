tldr: The article presents an analysis of steady and transient free-convection flow past a semi-infinite vertical flat plate. The plate's temperature varies as a power function of the distance from the leading edge. The study investigates the behavior of the solution as time progresses and the transition from the unsteady one-dimensional solution to the steady-state solution. Numerical methods are used to solve the boundary-layer equations, and the results are compared with previous studies.
