tldr: The authors, Fowler and Rideal, discuss the rate of maximum activation by collision for complex molecules and their applications to gas reactions. They propose that the number of degrees of freedom of a molecule can be effectively relevant in the activation process, challenging previous conclusions that collisions were too slow for unimolecular reactions.
