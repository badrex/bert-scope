tldr: The article discusses the impact of human-made chemicals and ionizing radiation on genetic mutations and their consequences for human health. It revisits Muller's 1950 paper on the genetic decay of the human species due to increasing mutation pressure and relaxation of natural selection. The author concludes that while there is a certain increase in malformations and diseases due to these factors, genetic counseling, antenatal diagnosis, and research on the biological conditions of mutagenic chemicals can help reduce genetic risks.
