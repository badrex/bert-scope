  - Wrinkled Membranes
tldr: The author extends tension field theory to include anisotropic and nonlinear elastic properties in order to analyze wrinkled membranes with woven or fibrous textures. The study determines the distribution of tension rays and the magnitude of maximum tensile stress for various membrane shapes and boundary conditions, with potential applications in space and lightweight portable structures.
