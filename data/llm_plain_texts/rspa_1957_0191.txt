tldr: The authors propose that the mutual friction force in a heat current in liquid helium II is associated with turbulence in the superfluid, which takes the form of a tangled mass of quantized vortex lines. They discuss the observed properties of the force and provide a detailed theory of the generation and decay of superfluid turbulence, explaining how the force arises from collisions between thermal excitations and the vortex lines.
