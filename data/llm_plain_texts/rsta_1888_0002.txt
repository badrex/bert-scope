tldr: The authors, G. D. Liveing and J. Dewar, studied the spectrum of the oxy-hydrogen flame and discovered a series of lines forming the strongest part of the spectrum. They found that the spectrum consists of a succession of rhythmic series of lines, with lines of each series being stronger and more closely set at the more refrangible end and becoming weaker and wider apart towards the less refrangible end. The authors also found a similarity in the grouping of lines in the water spectrum and the solar spectrum.
