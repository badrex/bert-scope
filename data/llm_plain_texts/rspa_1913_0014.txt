revised_title: 'Investigation of Positive Ionisation Produced by Platinum and Certain Salts Upon Heating'

  - Thermionic emission

  - Sodium ortho-phosphate
  - Sodium pyro-phosphate
tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate the effect of surrounding gas on thermionic currents from different substances, specifically focusing on positive ionisation produced by platinum and certain salts when heated. They found that the nature of the surrounding gas has a significant impact on the magnitude of the thermionic current, and that the positive ions emitted by heated salts are charged atoms of the metallic constituent of the salt under test.
