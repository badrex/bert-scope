tldr: The author, A.W. Hofmann, discovered a new sulfur compound derived from thiobenzamide and studied its properties and reactions. The compound is remarkably stable and can be synthesized through various chemical reactions. The author also found that the new compound undergoes an interesting transformation when exposed to nascent hydrogen, leading to the formation of a new base. This base is found to be isomeric with another compound, ethenyldiphenyldiamine, and has distinct properties and reactions.
