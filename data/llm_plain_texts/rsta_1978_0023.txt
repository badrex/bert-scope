tldr: This article discusses the distribution and redistribution of heat-producing elements, such as potassium, uranium, and thorium, in the Earth's continents. It explores the possibility of an early formation of a "protocrust" that concentrated these elements and how secondary processes regulate their distribution. The author also considers the role of core formation and the Earth's history in the concentration of these elements in the continents.
