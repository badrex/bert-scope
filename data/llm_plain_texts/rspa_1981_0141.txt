tldr: This article presents a method for constructing particular integrals and solutions of linear systems of differential equations that can be reduced to a lower order. The author develops an algorithm to find the substitutions that reduce the original and adjoint systems, allowing for the determination of the general solution of the original system using the solution of the reduced system.
