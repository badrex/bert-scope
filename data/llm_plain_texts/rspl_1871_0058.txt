tldr: This article investigates the connection between coal mine explosions and meteorological conditions, specifically focusing on barometric pressure and temperature. The authors analyze data from various coal mining districts and meteorological records to understand the factors contributing to explosions in coal mines. They find that the number of fatal accidents has decreased over time, but the number of serious accidents involving multiple fatalities has increased. The authors emphasize the importance of understanding these connections to improve coal mine safety.
