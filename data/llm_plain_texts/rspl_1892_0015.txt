tldr: The author investigates the abductor and adductor fibers of the recurrent laryngeal nerve and their functions. They explore the differences in the fibers' responses to various conditions, such as organic affections, freezing, and anesthesia. The study aims to understand why abductor fibers are more prone to succumb before adductors in certain nerve affections.
