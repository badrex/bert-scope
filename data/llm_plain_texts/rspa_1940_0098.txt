tldr: This study investigates the effect of vessel diameter on the slow combustion of hydrocarbons, demonstrating that the diameter is a critical factor in the reaction rate. The research focuses on the oxidation of various hydrocarbons, including methane, ethane, propane, acetylene, ethylene, and propylene, and shows that the diameter of the reaction vessel can significantly impact the reaction rate and induction period. The findings support the theory of degenerate branching reactions, where surface deactivation can be a limiting factor in the combustion process.
