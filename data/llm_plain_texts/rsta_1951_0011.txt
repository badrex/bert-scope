tldr: 'The authors investigate the photoconductivity of lead telluride films and explore their potential for infra-red detection. They describe the preparation and properties of these films, and study their conductivity and infra-red photoconductivity as a function of temperature and lead impurity. The authors propose a mechanism for the photoconductivity based on a single lattice model, and discuss the implications for the development of efficient infra-red photoconductors.'
