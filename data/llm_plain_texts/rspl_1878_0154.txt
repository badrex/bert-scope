tldr: This paper presents experiments conducted by J. T. Bottomley and Sir William Thomson to determine the thermal conductivity of water. They used two methods of heating and observed the heat conducted from the surface downwards. The results showed that the thermal conductivity of water is approximately 0.022 to 0.0245 square centimeters per second. Some preliminary experiments were also made on the thermal conductivity of a solution of zinc sulfate and the specific heat of the solution at different densities was determined.
