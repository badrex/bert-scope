tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments to study the mechanical viscosity of fluids in eddying motion. They found that the shearing stress in these fluids is proportional to the mean speed of flow and is also a function of the dimensions of the channel in which the motion takes place. The results showed that the coefficient of mechanical viscosity is a constant quantity for all values of the radius in artificially roughened pipes, and it is directly proportional to the velocity of flow at the axis of the pipe and the linear dimension of the pipe.'
