tldr: The author investigates the continuity of protoplasm between plant cells, focusing on pulvini and endosperm cells. They discover that cells communicate with each other through delicate protoplasmic threads that pass through cell walls and pits. This research helps to understand various plant phenomena, such as leaf movement, germination, and tendril action.
