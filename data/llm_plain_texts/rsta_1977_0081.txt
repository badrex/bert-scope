tldr: The authors investigate the luminescence properties of lunar samples, focusing on the cause and significance of luminescence in lunar plagioclase. They identify the activators responsible for the emission peaks and suggest that the difference in the near-infrared emission between lunar and terrestrial materials is due to the different conditions prevailing during their formation, such as reducing conditions for lunar surface materials. Luminescence photography can be used as a quick survey method for examining the form and distribution of plagioclase crystals in rough samples.
