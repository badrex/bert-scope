tldr: The authors studied the chain transfer in the polymerization of acrylonitrile using different solvents. They found that the chain transfer constants for acrylonitrile were higher than those for styrene, but the relative trend was similar in both cases. The transfer characteristics of acrylonitrile with halogenated solvents were strikingly different from other monomers, with halogenated solvents being poor chain-transferring agents. The authors suggested that the inherent instability of compounds containing the C-Cl group was responsible for this unusual behavior.
