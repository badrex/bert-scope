tldr: The authors studied the effects of choline and neurine in cerebrospinal fluid and found that choline causes a drop in blood pressure and is toxic, while neurine is a more powerful poison. These substances are linked to General Paralysis of the Insane, a disease characterized by degeneration in the brain's cerebral cortex. The research aimed to understand the role of these substances in the disease and their potential impact on patients.
