tldr: The author presents a theoretical analysis of molecular diffusion and dispersion in fluid flow, focusing on the balance between convection and diffusion in a laminar flow. The study provides conditions under which dispersion can be used to measure molecular diffusion, and discusses the implications for experimental design and interpretation.
