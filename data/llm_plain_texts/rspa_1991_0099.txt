tldr: The authors used resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) to detect hydrogen atoms during the oscillatory combustion of hydrogen in a well-stirred flow reactor. They compared the experimental results with numerical analysis of a thermokinetic model and found that the maximum concentration of hydrogen atoms was reached before the hydroxyl radicals. This study provides insights into the kinetic mechanisms controlling oscillatory oxidation of hydrogen.
