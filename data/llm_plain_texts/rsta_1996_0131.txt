tldr: This article reviews the use of X-ray diffraction for microstructural investigations in ferroelastic materials. Advances in detector technology and computational power have led to the development of powerful methods for analyzing mesoscopic twin structures, providing insights into domain wall thickness, mosaicity, spontaneous strain, and grain size. These findings are important for understanding wall-related superconductivity, pinning of magnetic flux lines, and the geological history of mineral samples.
