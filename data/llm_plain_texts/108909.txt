tldr: The author explores the Principle of Correspondence and its application to finding the number of curves that satisfy given conditions, particularly in the context of contact with a given curve. They discuss the concept of united points and how they relate to the number of curves and their properties. The author also touches upon the differences between nodes and cusps in the context of united points.
