tldr: The authors studied the metabolism of sea urchin eggs during the fertilization reaction. They found that there is a sudden evolution of gas during fertilization, mainly derived from bicarbonate in the sea water. The consumption rate of the eggs increases upon fertilization, and the authors developed a special technique to measure the respiratory quotient at very short time intervals to better understand the metabolism during this process.
