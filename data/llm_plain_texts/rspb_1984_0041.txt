tldr: This study discovered high conductance anion-selective channels in rat cultured Schwann cells using the patch-clamp technique. These channels were found to have a conductance of about 450 and were activated after several minutes of exposure to the bathing medium. The channels showed a slight permeability to small cations but were mainly permeable to anions. The physiological role of these channels remains unknown.
