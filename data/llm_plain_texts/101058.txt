tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the bleeding of trees and the circulation of sap. They observed that trees bled more when exposed to frost and warmth, and that different tree species reacted differently to these conditions. The authors also discussed the possibility of a circulation system in plants, similar to the circulatory system in animals, and the role of vessels in transporting sap.
