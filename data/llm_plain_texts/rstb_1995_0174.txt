tldr: The article presents a study on how artificial neural networks can simulate human visual texture segmentation and target detection in line-element images. The researchers developed four models with different types of orientation-contrast-sensitive modules to mimic the functionality of certain cortical cells. Model 4, containing both types of orientation-contrast-sensitive modules, successfully accounted for human performance in segmentation and detection tasks. The findings contribute to understanding the mechanisms of early visual processing and the development of artificial models for image analysis.
