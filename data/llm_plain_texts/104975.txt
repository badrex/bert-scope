tldr: 'This article describes two separate accounts of unusual water agitation observed on November 1, 1755, in Scotland and Hamburgh. In Scotland, at the Queen's-Ferry, the water rose suddenly and then receded, causing boats to move rapidly on their ropes. In Hamburgh, similar agitation was observed in churches, with candlesticks and baptisteries moving, and the water in the canal and river agitated, forming whirlpools and rising and subsiding violently.'
