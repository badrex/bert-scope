tldr: The authors applied the cytochrome oxidase stain to autopsy specimens of human brain to study the presence of ocular dominance columns and cytochrome oxidase patches in the human visual cortex. They found that patches of cytochrome oxidase activity are present in human striate cortex, and also demonstrated the presence of ocular dominance columns using the same technique. This confirms the previous suggestion that these patterns may exist in the human brain.
