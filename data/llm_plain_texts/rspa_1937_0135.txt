tldr: The authors studied the molecular structure and spectroscopic properties of boron trifluoride (BF3) using infra-red and Raman spectroscopy. They found that the molecule is planar and determined its force constants. They also calculated the radius of the boron atom and analyzed the isotopic effects on the molecule's structure.
