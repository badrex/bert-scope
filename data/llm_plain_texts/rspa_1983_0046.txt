tldr: The authors present an improved solution to the fourth moment equation for intensity fluctuations in a wave propagating through a randomly fluctuating medium. They use a two-scale expansion procedure to derive the zero-order approximation and the correction term, which provides better agreement with previous numerical work and allows for approximate error estimates.
