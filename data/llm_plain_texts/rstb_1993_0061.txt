tldr: This article challenges the concept of conventional signaling and suggests that all signals evolve to be reliable. The author argues that the handicap principle, which states that investment in signals increases their reliability, is crucial for understanding animal signaling systems. By reinterpreting conventional signals as reliable signals, the article provides a new perspective on the evolution and design of animal communication.
