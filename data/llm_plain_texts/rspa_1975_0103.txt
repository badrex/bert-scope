tldr: The authors investigated the Rb I absorption spectrum between 40 and 120 \#xC5; using the 2.6 Bonn synchrotron. They discovered a broad absorption maximum in the photoionization continuum and identified discrete structure associated with the excitation of a -subshell electron. The results provide insights into inner shell photoionization processes and potential barrier phenomena, which can be further studied to understand atomic physics and spectroscopy.
