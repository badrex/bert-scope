tldr: The authors study the oblique reflection of sound pulses by imagining a sound wave generated by the supersonic motion of a thin wedge. They investigate the motion when the wave meets the surface of separation between two media, showing that there is a diffused wave in the denser medium with a wave front that precedes the incident wave near the surface of separation. This wave is due to diffraction in the lighter medium around the edge of the incident wave. The authors also find that there is still a reflected wave, and its amplitude is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to that of the incident pulse.
