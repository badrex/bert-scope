tldr: The author conducted experiments on the electric arc to study the formation of hydrocyanic acid and nitrites. They found that the presence of impurities in the carbon and the rate of gas flow affected the yield of these compounds. The author also investigated the effect of dry and moist air on the formation of hydrocyanic acid and acetylene, and the influence of different gases on the formation of nitrites in the arc.
