tldr: This article discusses the historical development of understanding chemical communication in animals, particularly through the study of hormones and neurosecretion. It highlights the close relationship between the nervous and endocrine systems and how remarkable chemical advances have allowed researchers to set hormones in an evolutionary framework that includes chemical communication between members of the same species and ecosystems.
