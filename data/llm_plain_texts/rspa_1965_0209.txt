revised_title: 'Symmetry Properties of Subnuclear Particles and Weak Interactions'
semantic_tags:
  - Particle Physics
  - Weak Interactions
  - Unitary Symmetry
  - Leptonic Weak Interactions
  - Baryon Octet
tldr: The authors discuss the symmetry properties of subnuclear particles and their weak interactions, focusing on leptonic weak interactions and the baryon octet. They propose a theory that explains the relationship between the vector and axial parts of weak currents and the role of unitary symmetry in weak interactions.
