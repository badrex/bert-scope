semantic_tags:
  - Plasma physics

tldr: This article discusses the properties and behavior of magnetospheric plasmas, focusing on the cyclotron resonance and Alfven mode instabilities. It explains how these instabilities are driven by the hot protons in the magnetosphere and how they affect the particle distribution and energy. The article also explores the relationship between these instabilities and the proton drift, as well as the origin of the hot protons in the magnetosphere.
