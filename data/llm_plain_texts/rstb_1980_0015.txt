tldr: This article discusses the study of temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants of fowl plague virus (FPV) and their role in understanding the genetics and physiology of orthomyxoviruses. The researchers found that ts mutants can help determine the number of genes in the virus genome and identify the products of individual genes. They also discovered that ts mutations can lead to a decrease or loss of virus pathogenicity, which could be useful in developing live virus vaccines.
