revised_title: Lunar Differentiation Processes and Trace Element Abundances
semantic_tags:
  - Lunar geology
  - Trace elements
  - Planetary differentiation
  - Incompatible elements
  - Moon's crust
tldr: This article discusses the differentiation processes of the Moon, focusing on the trace element abundances found in lunar samples. The authors argue that a partial melting process extracted trace elements from the Moon's interior into the crust, while the patterns of incompatible elements in mare basalts suggest a second partial melting process. The study provides insights into the Moon's elemental distribution and composition.
