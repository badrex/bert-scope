tldr: This paper describes experiments conducted to directly compare electrostatic and electromagnetic forces. The author used a torsion balance to measure the ratio of electromagnetic to electrostatic units of electricity and found it to be 27.79 Ohms. The results are discussed in the context of the electromagnetic theory of light, with the author suggesting that the ratio of electrical units and the velocity of light are one and the same physical quantity.
