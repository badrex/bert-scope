tldr: 'The author investigates the relationship between soil protozoa and bacteria, challenging the idea that ciliates, amoebae, and flagellates do not limit bacterial numbers in soil. They find that a protozoan fauna exists in the soil, and its activity is a factor limiting bacterial numbers. The author also identifies the properties of the limiting factor and suggests that it is likely due to the presence of active living organisms, specifically protozoa.'
