tldr: The author examines the effects of phosphoric acid on the spectrum of potassium in brain educts. They found that phosphoric acid weakens the intensity of the potassium spectrum, making it difficult to accurately estimate the concentration of potassium in a solution. This has implications for understanding the chemical composition of the brain and its inorganic components.
