tldr: The authors explore the static distribution of charged dust in general relativity, demonstrating that a functional relationship between the electrostatic potential and the charge density follows directly from the field equations. They also show that under certain assumptions, the equality of matter and charge densities and the relation between them can be deduced from the field equations. The study has implications for understanding the behavior of charged dust in equilibrium and the field in empty space outside charged dust distributions.
