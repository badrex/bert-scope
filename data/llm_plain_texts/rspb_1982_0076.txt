tldr: This article demonstrates that a simple adaptation mechanism called proportional gain adjustment can endow the perceptual system with useful error correction and recalibration properties. The mechanism maintains a fixed relation between the external variable and the internal signal, ensuring that the average of the measured signal in the environment is always mapped onto a fixed internal representation. This process can be applied to various perceptual processes, such as visual, auditory, and tactile perception, and can help maintain a stable and accurate perception of the environment despite changes and perturbations.
