tldr: This article discusses the effects of altitude on human growth and development in high-altitude populations from Ethiopia, Peru, and Nepal. The study found that while hypoxia and other environmental factors influence growth, genetic influences may play a more significant role in high-altitude populations. The article highlights the importance of understanding the complex interplay between genetics and environment in shaping human growth and development in different regions.
