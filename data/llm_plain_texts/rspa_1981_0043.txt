tldr: This study investigates the crystal and molecular structures of N-methylacetamide complexes with alkali and alkaline earth metals, focusing on the nature of metal coordination, the effect of cation binding on peptide geometry, and the interaction of cations with amides. The research provides a basis for understanding the role of ion-amide interactions in biological processes and comparing the structures of these complexes with other metal complexes, including antibiotics.
