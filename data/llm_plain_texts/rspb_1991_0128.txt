tldr: This study investigates the genetic uniformity of barley crops and its powdery mildew pathogen, which contributes to the difficulty in controlling the disease. The research found that a single pathogen clone with a significant advantage in virulence can cause severe epidemics in genetically uniform crops. This contrasts with the natural genetic variation in plant populations that helps reduce the impact of diseases.
