  - Spectral Color
tldr: This study investigates the color of power spectra in chaotic ecological models and analyzes simple models using 'universal' parameters to compare and understand the parameter values that produce different color spectra. The research questions the usefulness of certain models in describing ecological systems and explores the population behavior associated with each color spectrum.
