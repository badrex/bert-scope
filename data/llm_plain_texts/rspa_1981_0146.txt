tldr: The authors study a special nonlinear functional equation and its analytic solutions. They establish the manner in which the main solution depends on the equation's parameter and analyze the properties of the solutions, including the existence of algebraic branch points. This research contributes to the understanding of nonlinear functional equations and their applications in mathematics.
