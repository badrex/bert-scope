tldr: 'The author conducted a series of experiments on Iceland spar to investigate double refraction and dispersion. They compared their findings with Huygens' construction for extraordinary wave propagation. The study aimed to determine the angle of incidence and deviation for different wave lengths, providing valuable insights into the behavior of light in biaxal crystals.'
