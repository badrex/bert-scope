tldr: The article explores the scattering and absorption of incident gravitational and electromagnetic radiation by two extreme Reissner-Nordström black-holes. The author analyzes axial perturbations of a special case of the Majumdar-Papapetrou solution in general relativity and derives equations governing these perturbations. The author demonstrates that the energy flux in the system has a divergence that vanishes, leading to a conservation theorem that is essential for understanding the scattering process.
