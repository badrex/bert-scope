tldr: This article reviews strategies for controlling pattern formation in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. It discusses the development of somatic and germ-line tissues, which use different approaches to control pattern formation. The somatic tissues develop through invariant cell lineages, while the germ-line tissue follows a variable pattern of divisions. The study focuses on the role of regulatory cells, such as the distal tip cells, in controlling germ-line tissue organization and pattern formation.
