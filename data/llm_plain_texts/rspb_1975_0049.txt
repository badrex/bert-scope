tldr: The authors discuss the possibility of recognizing alien life through the study of macroscopic morphology, focusing on the shapes and patterns produced by living systems. They argue that the presence of repetitive and complex shapes that cannot be explained by natural processes may serve as evidence for the existence of life, and emphasize the importance of finding multiple examples of such shapes to strengthen the case for life's involvement.
