tldr: The authors examine the electrolytic separation factor and reaction mechanism for hydrogen and deuterium. They consider various rate-determining mechanisms and take into account isotopic differences in thermodynamic quantities and partition functions. The results help explain experimental data and provide insights into the reaction mechanism.
