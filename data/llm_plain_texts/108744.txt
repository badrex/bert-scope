tldr: The author investigates properties of numbers related to Fermat's theorem of polygonal numbers, focusing on the division of numbers into 4 squares. They explore the connections between Fermat's theorem and the division of odd numbers into square numbers, as well as the differences between the roots of the squares. This research sheds light on the mathematical properties and history of Fermat's work.
