tldr: This study examines the ultrastructure of coccoliths from the marine alga Emiliania huxleyi using ultra-high resolution electron microscopy. The researchers discovered two different types of structures in the coccoliths, one in the upper elements and the other in the basal plate. The lower element is a thin, single crystalline sheet of calcite, while the upper element has a more complex structure. The study provides insights into the formation mechanisms of coccoliths and their biomineralization process.
