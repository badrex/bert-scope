  - Order-Disorder Transformations
tldr: The authors studied the atomic rearrangement process in copper-gold alloys and found that the energy of atomic interchange is primarily determined by the atoms' immediate neighbors, rather than the superlattice order. They also discovered that the specific heat of the alloy remains high even above the critical temperature, indicating a high degree of local order.
