tldr: The authors discovered new bands in the secondary spectrum of hydrogen and discussed their relation to the quantum theory. They found that these bands have a similar structure to other known bands and that they can be classified into different series. The intensity distribution of these series shows a pattern of threefold intensity alternation, which they explain as a combination of two different intensity alternation principles. They also found that some of these bands have a similar configuration in other parts of the spectrum, indicating a connection between them.
