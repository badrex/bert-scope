tldr: The author, Peter Woulfe, discovered a new orange colouring substance from the Island of Amsterdam. The substance is soluble in spirit of wine, vitriolic aether, and soap, but not in water, acids, or alkalies. It can be used to dye silk and wool, and has some affinity with annotta. The author also studied its properties, such as its solubility, color changes, and reactions with various substances.
