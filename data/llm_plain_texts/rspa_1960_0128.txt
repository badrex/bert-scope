tldr: The author generalizes Mazur's theorem on the division of an n-sphere by a topological (n-1)-sphere and applies it to show that closed Euclidean n-space is split into two n-cells by an embedded topological n-sphere under certain conditions. This study contributes to the understanding of the properties of topological spaces and their applications in various fields.
