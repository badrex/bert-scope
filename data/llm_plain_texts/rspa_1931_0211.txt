tldr: This article investigates the kinetics of adsorption processes, specifically the adsorption of hydrogen on charcoal at the boiling point of liquid oxygen. The authors determine the isotherms of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, as well as mixtures of these gases, and discuss the factors affecting adsorption equilibria, such as activation processes and diffusion. They develop a method to study the kinetics of adsorption processes and analyze the mass of gas removed in unit time, providing insights into the dynamics of adsorption.
