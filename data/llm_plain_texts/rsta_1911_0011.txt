revised_title: 'Overcoming Difficulties in Delicate Balance Measurements and Improving Weighing Accuracy'
semantic_tags:
  - Weighing accuracy
  - Balance measurements
  - Temperature effects
  - Balance design
  - Atomic weight determinations
tldr: The authors discuss the challenges they faced during the standardization of weights and the methods they used to overcome them. They investigated the anomalous behavior of delicate balances and developed devices to increase accuracy in weighings. Their findings can be applied to atomic weight determinations and other work involving accurate weighing.
