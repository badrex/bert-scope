tldr: This article explores the behavior of magnetic induction in supraconductors of different shapes, such as spheres and ellipsoids, in the presence of external magnetic fields. The authors develop a thermodynamic approach to understand the magnetic transition curves and the relationship between magnetic induction and external magnetic fields. They also discuss the limitations of the longitudinal experiments and propose alternative ways to interpret the magnetic properties of supraconductors.
