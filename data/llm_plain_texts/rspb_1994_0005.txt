tldr: This study investigates the impact of ecological factors and predation on sexual conflict in guppy populations in Trinidad. It reveals that males from high-predation sites engage in less antipredator behavior, have lower foraging rates, and spend more time pursuing females and attempting sneaky matings. As a result, females in these locations face significant sexual harassment, which may compromise their choice and have evolutionary consequences.
