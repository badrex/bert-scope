tldr: A new bathymetric chart of the Red Sea has been created using recent soundings and surveys. The chart reveals steeper cliffs along the coastlines and newly found narrow deeps at the base of the margin cliffs in the northern half of the Red Sea. These findings contribute to the understanding of the Red Sea's structure and evolution.
