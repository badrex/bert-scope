revised_title: 'NGF's Role in Inflammatory Pain and Sensory Neurons Development'
semantic_tags:
  - Neurotrophins
  - Sensory neurons
  - Inflammatory pain
  - NGF
  - Pain signaling systems
tldr: The article discusses the role of nerve growth factor (NGF) in mediating inflammatory pain in adult mammals. It presents evidence that NGF regulates the sensitivity of pain-signaling systems and is up-regulated in various inflammatory conditions. NGF's involvement in the development and maintenance of sensory neurons is also explored, highlighting its importance in pain-related behaviors.
