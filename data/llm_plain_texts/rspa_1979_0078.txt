tldr: The authors investigate the microstructure of nitrided austenitic Fe-Ni-V alloys and discover a fine modulated structure consisting of substitutional-interstitial solute-atom clusters periodically distributed along specific directions. This modulated structure is characterized by periodic electron microscopy images, sidebands in both electron and X-ray diffraction patterns, and unit-cell dimensions increased with respect to those of the equilibrium austenite. The authors discuss the thermodynamic factors and temperature effects on the development and overageing behavior of the modulated structures and propose that the mechanism by which the periodic substitutional-interstitial solute-atom clusters develop in nitrided austenite is consistent with spinodal decomposition.
