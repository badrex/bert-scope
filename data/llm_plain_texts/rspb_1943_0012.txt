tldr: This study investigates the effects of sympatheticomimetic and parasympatheticomimetic drugs on the tone of the earthworm's alimentary canal. The results indicate that the drugs' actions are similar to nerve stimulation, suggesting that the antagonistic groups of nerves are cholinergic and adrenergic. The findings extend the similarity between the earthworm's gut control system and that of vertebrates, providing evidence of chemical transmission in earthworms that is similar to that seen in vertebrates.
