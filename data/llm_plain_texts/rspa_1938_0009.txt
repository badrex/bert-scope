tldr: The authors studied the lightning discharge mechanism using improved instruments and cathode-ray oscillographs. They discovered that the polarity of individual strokes to the ground is generally negative, and the stepped leader process involves a different mechanism than the dart streamer. The authors also proposed that negative streamers travel along a previously ionized channel, with the step streamers following a slower pilot streamer.
