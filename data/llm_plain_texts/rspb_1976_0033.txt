tldr: This article discusses the process of bacterial sporulation, focusing on the biochemistry and genetics of this primitive developmental system. The author examines the morphological and biochemical changes that occur during sporulation in Bacillus subtilis and other bacilli, and explores the relevance of these changes to the understanding of developmental systems and cell division. The article also highlights the importance of studying bacterial spores for medical, veterinary, and agricultural purposes.
