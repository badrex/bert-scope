tldr: The author discusses the current state of the theory of natural selection and its implications in adaptation and the origin of species. They emphasize the importance of understanding heritability, the role of mutations, and the validity of the selective death-rate in natural selection. The author also highlights the need for further research in various aspects of natural selection, such as the coordination of evolutionary changes and the differences between geographical races.
