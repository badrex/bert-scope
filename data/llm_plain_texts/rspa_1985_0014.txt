tldr: The authors present a theoretical analysis of isothermal elastohydrodynamic lubrication in concentrated contacts where the direction of lubricant entrainment coincides with the major axis of the Hertzian contact ellipse. They compute 72 new solutions and provide expressions for calculating minimum and central film thickness, enabling more accurate predictions for a wide range of machine elements.
