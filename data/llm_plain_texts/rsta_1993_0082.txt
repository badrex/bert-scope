tldr: This article explores the use of rare gases as natural tracers of subsurface fluid movement in sedimentary basins. By analyzing the mass balance of atmosphere-derived and crustally produced radiogenic and nucleogenic rare gases in natural gas reservoirs, researchers can better understand the scales of fluid movement and the importance of focusing effects. The study focuses on several gas fields in the Pannonian, Vienna, and Po Basins, providing valuable insights into the behavior of rare gases in subsurface fluids.
