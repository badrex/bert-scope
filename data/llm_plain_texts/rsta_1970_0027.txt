tldr: This article discusses the structure and evolution of the Red Sea and the Dead Sea rift, focusing on the shear movement along the Dead Sea rift. The authors examine various hypotheses and geological investigations to determine if the shear hypothesis is well established. They conclude that the shear movement is indeed well established, and the prediction that all geological features are offset by about 100 km across the rift is correct. The article presents a series of illustrations and maps to support their findings.
