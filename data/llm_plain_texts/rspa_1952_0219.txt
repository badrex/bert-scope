tldr: The authors studied the g9/2-shell in atomic configurations and found that the level of seniority three is never the ground state, which conflicts with experimental findings. This suggests a breakdown in the jj-coupling approximation. The results have implications for understanding nuclear isomers and the nuclear shell model.
