tldr: The author examines the periodical laws in larger magnetic disturbances at St. Helena and the Cape of Good Hope Observatories. They found that there is a striking connection between the two places in the laws of disturbance occurrence, with a minimum disturbance in 1843 and a maximum in 1848. The study also reveals that the main causes of annual variation in disturbances are not dependent on local seasons.
