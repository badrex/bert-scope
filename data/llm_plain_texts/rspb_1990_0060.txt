tldr: The article discusses the evolution of the genetic code and how it has changed over time. The authors present evidence of non-universal genetic codes in mitochondria and certain organisms, which have evolved through similar mechanisms without causing detrimental changes to amino acid sequences. They also explore the possible mechanisms behind these code changes, such as the codon capture rule and the production of unassigned codons.
