tldr: This article investigates the absorption spectra of hydrazine and ethylene-diamine, as well as their mono- and di-hydrochlorides, in aqueous solutions. The authors discuss how the absorption due to nitrogen lone-pairs is suppressed as the basicity of the solutions decreases, providing insights into the behavior of amines and diamines.
