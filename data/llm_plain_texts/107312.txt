tldr: The author, William Hyde Wollaston, examines the primitive crystal forms of carbonate minerals, such as limestone, magnesian carbonate, and iron spar. He finds that their angles differ from each other and that the form of these crystals is dependent on their chemical composition. This research helps in the identification and analysis of different minerals and their properties.
