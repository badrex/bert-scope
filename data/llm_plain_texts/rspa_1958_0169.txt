tldr: The author investigates the impact of the Earth's oblateness on the orbit of a near satellite. They develop an analytical solution using a perturbation method, which applies primarily to orbits with low eccentricity. The study reveals four main effects of the Earth's oblateness on satellite motion, including the rotation of the orbital plane and changes in the period of revolution. The findings are compared with observations of Sputnik 1 and 2.
