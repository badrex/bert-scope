tldr: The author examines the gravitational stability of an infinite homogeneous turbulent medium, considering the effects of turbulence on density fluctuations and the potential for instability. The study provides a new criterion for gravitational stability, taking into account the velocity of sound and the mean square velocity of turbulence, and applies it to the interstellar medium in our galaxy.
