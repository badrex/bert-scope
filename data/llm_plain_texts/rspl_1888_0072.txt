tldr: The author discovered a new silico-organic compound, silicotetraphenylamide, formed by the reaction between silicon tetrabromide and aniline. This compound is the first well-defined compound where silicon is in direct and exclusive union with the nitrogen of amidic groups. The detailed investigation of this substance and its derivatives promises to shed light on the relations between silicon and nitrogen.
