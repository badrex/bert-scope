tldr: The article discusses the interaction between dislocations and voids in materials, particularly in the context of irradiated materials. The authors propose a mechanism called the "induced image effect" to explain void growth in materials like steel, where the dislocation density does not drop at saturation. They provide a mathematical formulation and numerical evaluations of the interaction energy and force between a screw dislocation and a void, which can help in understanding the growth kinetics of voids in materials.
