tldr: The authors conducted a study on the lignite of Bovey Tracey in Devon, examining its age and flora. They found that the lignite is Upper Oligocene in age, filling a gap in the British geological sequence. The flora consists of plants similar to those found in the Wetterau lignites, indicating a close relationship between the two deposits. This study provides valuable information about the age and composition of the lignite, as well as insights into the plant life that existed during the Oligocene period.
