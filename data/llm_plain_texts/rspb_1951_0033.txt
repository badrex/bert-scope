tldr: The authors discovered unusual structures in the African migratory locust, Locusta migratoria migratorioides, which they believe function as thermoreceptors. These structures, called antennal crescents and fenestrae, are more sensitive to heat than the surface in general. The authors' observations and experiments provide a better understanding of the behavior of locusts when exposed to sunlight and other heat sources.
