tldr: The article presents an exact analysis of the geometry and kinematics of Wildhaber-Novikov (W-N) circular arc gears, which offer higher load-carrying capacity and lower frictional losses compared to conventional involute gears. The theory provides essential geometrical and kinematic data for analyzing contact stresses and elastohydrodynamic lubrication in these gears.
