tldr: This article presents magnetical observations made in the West Indies, Brazil, and North America between 1834 and 1837. The observations were conducted to determine the dip, horizontal forces, and the effects of low fogs and stationary clouds on compass variation. The data collected was analyzed using an instrument of modern construction by Dollond, and the results were compared with direct experiments using the dipping needle.
