tldr: The article discusses novel meteorological methods for measuring trace gas fluxes between land and atmosphere. It focuses on mass balance methods and Lagrangian dispersion techniques, which are useful for measuring trace gas fluxes in small experimental plots and plant canopies. These methods help in understanding trace gas exchange in the soil-plant system and have applications in measuring emissions from pesticide residues, ammonia, nitrous oxide, and methane.
