tldr: The author, Henry Bence Jones, conducted experiments to determine the rate of passage of crystalloids, such as lithium salts, into and out of the vascular and non-vascular textures of the body. Using spectroscopy, he analyzed the presence of lithium in various tissues and fluids, such as blood, urine, hair, and nails, to understand how quickly these salts pass through the body and cease to be detectable.
