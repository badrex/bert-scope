tldr: This article discusses the study of Brillouin scattering in biological systems, focusing on the analysis of collagen, keratin, and synthetic polypeptides. The authors use a triple-pass Fabry-Perot interferometer and a single-mode argon-ion laser to measure the Brillouin shifts in these materials. They observe unique spectra and discuss the implications of their findings for understanding the molecular properties of biological systems.
