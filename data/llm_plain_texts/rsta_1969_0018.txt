tldr: This article investigates the effects of high-opacity atmospheres and molecular hydrogen dissociation on stellar models. The authors integrate stellar structure equations to study these effects and find that neither significantly modifies the Hayashi effect. They also discuss the potential impact of variability on the Hayashi effect and suggest that it may be an important factor to consider.
