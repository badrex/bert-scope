tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the specific ionic velocities of various ions in electrolytes. They developed a method to measure the velocity of ions by observing the movement of a color boundary in salt solutions. The results confirmed Kohlrausch's theory and provided a better understanding of the behavior of ions during electrolysis.
