tldr: The author, William Hewson, discovered the lymphatic system in birds and provided a detailed description of its structure and function. He found that birds have two thoracic ducts that carry transparent lymph, unlike quadrupeds which have one thoracic duct. This discovery challenges the theory of absorption by common veins in birds and supports the importance of the lymphatic system in their physiology.
