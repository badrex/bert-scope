semantic_tags:
  - Geophysics
  - Earthquake mechanics
  - Dislocation theory
  - Somigliana dislocations
  - Elasticity
tldr: This article discusses the application of dislocation theory, particularly Somigliana dislocations, to geophysical phenomena such as faults, cracks, and intrusions. It explains how dislocations can be used to describe and calculate the elastic fields, energy, and displacement associated with these geological events. The article also outlines methods for finding the displacement field around a dislocation in a semi-infinite solid with free surfaces.
