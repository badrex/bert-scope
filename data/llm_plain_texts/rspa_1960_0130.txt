tldr: The author critiques the Landau-Zener formula for curve-crossing transitions, pointing out its limitations and inaccuracies in predicting transition probabilities. The formula is derived assuming a model with defects, leading to a restricted range of validity. The author provides an alternative approach to calculate transition probabilities and discusses its implications for various atomic processes.
