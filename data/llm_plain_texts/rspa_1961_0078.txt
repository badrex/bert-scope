tldr: The authors studied the oxidation of propane and found that the maximum rate of oxidation varies more than linearly with propane pressure and less than linearly with oxygen pressure. They discovered that the ratio of rate to peroxide concentration forms a convenient metric for characterizing the reaction kinetics. The results indicate that the competing destruction of radicals in non-branching reactions is the main cause of the negative temperature dependence in propane oxidation. The study also shows that mineral salts, such as potassium chloride, have inhibitory effects on the oxidation of hydrocarbons, and the peroxide molecule is the main species affected by the salt in the low-temperature propane oxidation.
