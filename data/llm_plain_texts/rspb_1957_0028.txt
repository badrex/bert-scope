tldr: The article explores cytoplasmic differences in the fungus Aspergillus glaucus and how selection can lead to changes in phenotype. The author demonstrates that these changes can be reversible and are not due to total loss of self-reproducing elements or their function. The findings suggest that direct action of natural selection on the cytoplasm plays a role in adjusting phenotypes in the fungus, providing flexibility for adaptation to its environment.
