tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand if electricity is generated by the chemical action of fluids on metals or if it is set in motion by the contact of metals with different conducting powers. They found that the oxidation of metals is the primary cause of electric phenomena. The author also demonstrated that electricity can decompose water and that the same chemical power can be transferred using a common electrical machine. This confirms that electricity and galvanism are essentially the same and that their differences are due to variations in intensity and production methods.
