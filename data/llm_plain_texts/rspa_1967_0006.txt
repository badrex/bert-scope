tldr: The authors used nuclear orientation techniques to determine the hyperfine interaction fields in neutron-irradiated cobalt. They found that the hyperfine field on the nuclei decreased after annealing out the radiation damage. This study provides insights into the mechanism of radiation damage and annealing processes in metals.
