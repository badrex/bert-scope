tldr: This article discusses the evolution of the continental crust and its connection to the geology of uranium deposits. The author explores the role of granitic rocks in the formation and modification of the crust, as well as the impact of chelogenic cycles on the distribution and concentration of uranium. The study of isotope geochemistry, palaeomagnetism, and the distribution of structural provinces provides insights into the processes that shaped the Earth's crust and influenced the search for uranium deposits.
