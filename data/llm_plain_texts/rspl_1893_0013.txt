tldr: The author conducted experiments on the electrolysis of steam, using a modified apparatus to overcome previous experimenters' difficulties. They found that the excess of hydrogen appears at the negative electrode, and the excess of oxygen at the positive electrode. This research contributes to understanding the method of charge passing through gases and the chemical changes that occur during electrolysis.
