tldr: The author, George Graham, describes his experiments with three different needles to measure the variation of the horizontal needle at London. He developed a precise method to minimize errors and found that the needles would vary in their direction due to unknown factors, not just friction. This research contributed to a better understanding of the Earth's magnetic field and the development of more accurate compass technology.
