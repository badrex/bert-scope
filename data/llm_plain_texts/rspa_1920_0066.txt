tldr: This article explores the forces in surface films, focusing on theoretical considerations and experimental observations. The authors discuss the nature of surface films, the density of finely divided solids, and the compression of adsorbed fluids. They also examine the effects of pressure on chemical reactions in adsorption layers and provide estimates of the compressive forces acting on adsorbates.
