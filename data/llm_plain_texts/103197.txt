tldr: 'Father Bourzes observed a luminous appearance in the wake of ships in the Indian Seas. The light was visible at night and could be used to read large letters. The light appeared in various shapes and sizes and was more visible in fatty and foamy water. The phenomenon was also observed in fish swimming and in water stirred by a rope. Father Bourzes also observed marine rainbows and exhalations in the night that formed long tracts of light.'
