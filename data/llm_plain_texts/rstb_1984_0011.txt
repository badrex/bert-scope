tldr: This study investigates the high pressure nervous syndrome (h.p.n.s.) in humans during simulated dives to depths of 300-610 meters using different compression techniques and gas mixtures. The research examines the effects of compression speed, gas composition, and individual susceptibility on clinical, electrophysiological, and psychometric symptoms. The findings suggest that certain symptoms are present regardless of the compression technique, while others depend on the technique's intensity and quality. The study also highlights the importance of gas mixtures in mitigating symptoms and maintaining psychomotor performance during deep dives.
