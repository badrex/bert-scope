tldr: The study investigates the vision and refractive states of Humboldt penguins in both air and water. The results show that the penguins have good visual optics in both environments, with minimal refractive errors. The flattened cornea and the more spherical lens help minimize the loss of corneal power underwater, and the exaggerated accommodative ability compensates for this loss, allowing the penguins to see well in both air and water.
