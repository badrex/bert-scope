tldr: The authors studied the deuterium-neopentane exchange reaction over palladium supported on silica-alumina particles. They found that the product distribution of isomers is influenced by the competition between desorption, diffusion, and surface exchange. The theory based on a single-step surface mechanism can explain the wide variety of product distributions observed over the same catalyst. The results provide insights into the effects of desorption and diffusion on the kinetics of complex reactions.
