tldr: The article investigates the effects of K+ channel blockers on synaptic transmission in Drosophila learning and memory mutants. The study finds that K+ channel blockers, such as 3,4-diaminopyridine and tetraethylammonium, restore facilitation and post-tetanic potentiation in the neuromuscular synapses of the mutants, suggesting that a specific K+ conductance might be relevant to the lack of synaptic plasticity in these mutants.
