revised_title: The Structure and Function of Muscular Fibers
semantic_tags:
  - Muscular fibers
  - Elongation
  - Contraction
  - Nervous fibers
  - Gelatinous matter
tldr: The author examines a muscular fiber from a bullock's neck and compares its structure to that of a nervous fiber from a ganglion. They find that both consist of rows of globules held together by a gelatinous matter, but the globules in muscular fibers are larger and the gelatinous matter is less elastic, making the fibers more brittle. This study contributes to the understanding of the similarities and differences between muscles, nerves, and ganglions.
