tldr: Malerisaurus is a new eosuchian reptile discovered in the late Triassic Maleri Formation of India. This small, gracile, long-necked reptile was likely bipedal and able to climb trees or swim. Its skull indicates an insectivorous diet and its skeletal morphology provides information about a potentially undocumented lineage of eosuchian reptiles. Malerisaurus is assigned to the suborder Prolacertiformes and is tentatively allied to Protorosaurus in the family Protorosauridae.
