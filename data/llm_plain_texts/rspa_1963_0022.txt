tldr: This article presents a quantum theory of interacting particles with rigorous Lorentz covariance and conservation laws. The author develops a method to deal with the difficulties associated with point interactions, leading to a theory without infinite renormalization and allowing for a legitimate physical interpretation after applying supplementary conditions.
