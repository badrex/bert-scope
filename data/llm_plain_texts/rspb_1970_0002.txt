tldr: The author conducted electrophysiological experiments on the isolated labyrinth of the lamprey to study its responses to angular acceleration, tilting, and mechanical vibration. The results showed that the two semicircular canals in the lamprey can respond to angular accelerations in all planes, despite the absence of the horizontal canal. The vibration sensitivity of the lamprey labyrinth resembles that found in elasmobranchs, and the responses to angular acceleration were found to be similar to those in the gnathostome labyrinth.
