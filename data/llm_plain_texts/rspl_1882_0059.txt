tldr: The author investigates the formation of a dark plane of air over a heated wire in a dusty atmosphere. They propose that the heated wire heats the air around it, creating a difference in density that causes a current of clean air to flow through the dusty air. This results in a dark band of air rising from the wire, which the author explains through fluid dynamics and gas flow principles.
