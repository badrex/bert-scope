A simple model is used, considering the properties of leg muscles, to predict force patterns and jump performance. The findings suggest that high jumpers should run at moderate speeds and set down the foot well in front of the body, while long jumpers should run faster and place the foot less far forward with a steeper angle.\n"

      "Tags: ['Language Acquisition', 'Deaf Education', 'Communication', 'Linguistics', 'Sign Language']\n",
      "TLDR: The author, Dr. John Wallis, discusses his attempts to teach a dumb and deaf person to speak and understand language.

      "Tags: ['Linguistics', 'Language Development', 'Phonetics', 'Alphabet Design', 'Writing Systems']\n",
      "TLDR: The author, Francis Lodwick, presents a proposal for an \"Universal Alphabet\" to address the difficulties in writing and pronouncing various languages accurately. The proposed alphabet aims to contain all single sounds or letters used in any language, enabling better communication and understanding across languages. The author also discusses the importance of standardizing and perpetuating the true sounds of languages for future generations.\n",

      "Tags: ['Linguistics', 'Speech development', 'Pantomime', 'Language evolution', 'Phonetics']\n",
      "TLDR: The authors propose a hypothesis that human speech originated from pantomimic gestures, which the ear learned to identify through the secondary effects of these gestures on resonances. They tested this theory by creating fabricated words for simple actions and found that the sounds produced closely resembled actual words in primitive languages. This suggests that the formation of human speech may have been influenced by pantomimic gestures.\n",

      "TLDR: This article discusses the innatist issue in linguistic theory, which concerns the role of genetic programming in language acquisition. The author distinguishes four dimensions of research into syntax learning: analytical, computational, psychological, and neurophysiological. They argue that a general characterization of inductive learning may cover all known forms, including language acquisition, without excluding the possibility of separate learning competences for different aspects of experience.\n",
